# Simple Scraping

This project basically consists of a Python script to scrape an article given the url of the article and store the extracted text in a file. The script is also present in the form of a notebook.

The Scraped Article in this example is https://medium.com/@subashgandyer/papa-what-is-a-neural-network-c5e5cc427c7 but you can try it with any medium article.
