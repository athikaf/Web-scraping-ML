# Multipage Scraping (FINAL EXAM TASK)

This project consists of a python script to scrape the first couple of reviews present on a particular restuarant on Yelp - https://www.yelp.ca/biz/pai-northern-thai-kitchen-toronto-5?osq=Restaurants
Output - reviews.csv

The bonus task for this project was to extend it to scrape <em>ALL</em> of the reviews present on a particular restuarant on Yelp - https://www.yelp.ca/biz/pai-northern-thai-kitchen-toronto-5?osq=Restaurants
Output - yelp_reviews.xls

The zip file is what I submitted on the exam, for my own reference.
