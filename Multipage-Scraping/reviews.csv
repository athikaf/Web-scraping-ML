Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nhu N.,"It's a really busy restaurant but the staff are kind and patient. I came in with a big group and we ended up being late but the staff were very kind to us. I'm genuinely so grateful that they were accommodating and patient with us. The restaurant is nice, and there's a lot of seating. Service is kind and attentive. There was auto gratuity as we were a big group, and they only accept card for payment. I was able to leave an extra cash tip though- I felt so bad that we were late. 
I ordered the khao soi with curry- you can't adjust spice level for it. It was really good, but I think I prefer the Uptown location more. The beef was a bit tougher compared to the other one. The flavour was great, nice and sweet. It's honestly not too spicy. My boyfriend got the pad see ew, which was also really good. I feel like their food never disappoints. Everyone else at my table enjoyed their food. 
My meal came out to $28 with auto-gratuity. I left feeling full and happy. Definitely recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Celton M.,"Had a lovely Sunday night dinner at Pai! I was shocked how big it is! My friends and I walked in without a reservation, I discovered that the restaurant is massive - so there were several tables open. The vibe is quite intimate and cozy.
Servers were very nice. There were lots of staff on the floor. 
Food was delicious! I had the red curry with beef. Rice was perfect - not too sweet, but still nice.
Would highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael C.,"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen offers such a vibrant experience. I loved colorful lighting in the restaurant and the overall vibe at the bar.
We didn't have any reservations and the wait was 30 minutes so hung out at the bar which was a great experience. There's a large variety of drinks that were Toronto themed which caught my attention. They had drinks like ""Cherry Trent Jr"" and ""Scotchie Barnes"" which is playful. I chose the Thai Mojito.
Now when it came to dinner, the food was my highlight. I ordered the Green Curry Chicken and I must say that this was probably my favorite Green Curry Chicken ever. One thing that made this different than all others is that it's served in a coconut. The dish itself was tasty but one thing that I particularly loved was scraping the coconut and having a dessert-like experience afterward.
Overall this place was great. Great location, wonderful ambiance, and enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff. I appreciated that they were able to help my colleague who had a gluten and dairy allergy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa D.,"We arrived on a weekend for dinner around 4:30pm and the place was packed. There was a long line at the door. Luckily, we got a table after 10min wait. Their convenient location near many theatres and venues makes it a popular option in the area.
The restaurant is spacious with colourful decoration. The music isn't too loud and the noise level is suitable for conversations.
Our server told us their signature dishes are Pad Kra Pao and Khao Soi.
Pad Kra Pao: very good and well-seasoned. We ordered it with crispy pork and it was so delicious! Highly recommend ordering crispy pork to go with this dish.
Khao Soi: presentation was great, so tasty and comforting.
Thai milk tea: good, just the right amount of sweetness
Service was very good despite how busy the restaurant was.
I'd definitely come back to try other dishes.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela S.,"Dude. I think this is the best Thai restaurant Ive eaten outside of Thailand. Not to be dramatic. My family didn't reserve cuz we are clowns, so we waited 1.5 hours but it was well worth the wait.
The skewers were incredible - juicy and well grilled. The Moo Ping took me back to Thailand.
I got the fish green curry and it was good. The fish was well cooked and fresh. Very well balanced flavors, along with a fun presentation if you care for that. 
However, the Khao Soi (which is my favorite Thai dish ever) was incredible. Deep and rich with flavor (spicy, yet tangy, and sweet), and great portion size. 
The dessert was also incredible - we got the coconut ice cream, and it was so fresh. The toppings also added such a variety of texture.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dom G.,"Chicken wings were to die for.. so good, especially with the chilli sauce. Made my nose run because of the heat. Loved it. 
Khao soi was tasty too. So happy I ordered it. 
Loved this cute restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. 
So glad I took the time out to have lunch here during a work day!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laurel B.,"Wowowowow! What an experience! From start to finish, Pai is incredible and I'm so sad I won't be able to revisit it until my next trip to Toronto.
I was warned by multiple people that I'd have to wait in a long line if I wanted to go to Pai without a reservation. I decided to chance it anyway and dropped in as a single around 4pm on a Saturday and I was excited to find out it would only be a 10-15 minute wait. It ended up being just under 10 minutes.
I was seated at the bar at the far end of the deceptively large restaurant. The basement space feels cozy and colourful with lots of decor to look at and a tropical-vibe.
I started things off with a Thai mojito which was a brilliant purple colour. It was a refreshing twist on a classic. For dinner I had a vegetarian version of the Khao Soi which is served with tofu, veggies, and noodles (can be made vegan on request by changing out the egg noodles). This was one of the tastiest dishes I've ever had. The coconut-based broth was bright, flavourful, and perfectly spiced. It was very filling and I was sad that I couldn't take my leftovers with me.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christy Y.,"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen has got to be one of my favorite spots in Toronto! I was visiting for the weekend and decided to check it out on a Friday, even though we originally planned to go Saturday. It was a quick walk from our hotel, so we figured why not? Even though the place was packed, we got seated right away at a high-top table. Regular table wait time was 30-45 minutes. It's shared with other groups, but there's still plenty of room to feel comfortable and chat with your friends.
We ordered a ton of food: Thai chicken wings, the Northern Platter, pad see ew with shrimp, green curry, mango sticky rice, a Thai iced tea, and pineapple juice. There were three of us, we knew we overordered, but everything was so good that we somehow managed to finish it all.
The Thai chicken wings were fried with a nice texture, though they weren't super crispy. The sweet sauce drizzled over them was perfect, and I loved that balance of flavors. The Northern Platter was massive and looked almost intimidating--it's definitely shareable and could easily be a meal on its own. It came with sticky rice, pork skewers, northern laab salad, Thai sausages, and these squash fritters. The pork skewers were a highlight; they were so tasty I wanted more. there was a hint of sweetness coated on the pork skewers. The laab salad was really spicy, but even I couldn't stop myself from taking a few bites because it was that good. The Thai sausages had just the right amount of saltiness, and the squash fritters were a fun surprise--I thought they were sweet potato fries at first. 
The pad see ew with shrimp was delicious and not too oily, which is a huge plus. The only bummer was that there were only three shrimp. I didn't even get to try one. Next time, I'd probably go for the chicken or beef instead.
The green curry was amazing. We got it with beef, and it had just the right amount of spice. The beef pieces were a little thick, but overall, the flavors were on point. It was served in a whole coconut, which added this lovely coconut sweetness to the spicy curry. And once we finished, we even scooped out the coconut flesh!
Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't skip dessert. We ordered two mango sticky rice, because it's a must-have at any Thai restaurant. The mango was perfectly ripe and sweet, and the sticky rice, still warm, was drizzled with coconut sauce that made it so comforting. Even if you're full, you have to try it--it's worth it!
Overall, if you're in Toronto, Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is a must-visit. The food is incredible, the atmosphere is always buzzing, and it's totally worth the trip, whether you're a local or just in town for the weekend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley C.,"Good thai food overall! Really enjoyed the aesthetic inside and love that they have a waiting area + bar for you to wait at! Came at 6, waited for 15min for table for 4, and had a yummy meal! I think they were p rushed bc they took a while for food + forgot some things but not really a big bother. Kind people, great vibes, enjoyed a classic toronto spot overall :D
Felt on the same level as Soothr in NYC. Wish there were more noodles in Khao Soi, but the flavors were pretty great.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maurice V.,"UM what a spot. This was the first food spot I visited when going to Toronto for the first time and I was absolutely not disappointed.
I had heard that it can be difficult to walk in and be seated, but we were able to right away. We ordered a variety of appetizer/table sharers before our main meal - all of the apps were great - from vegetable fried rice to wings, etc.
My main meal was the pad gra prow which was recommended by the kind waitress. It was delicious and had just the right amount of spice (base level). The crunch that was added from the crispy pork was soo tasty.
Definitely understand why this restaurant is acclaimed. The atmosphere was beautiful, calm and relaxing and the food was delicious.
This is the type of restaurant that deserves a Michelin Star.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nolan F.,"We ordered:
1. Gaeng Kiaw Wan Green Curry
2. Pad Gra Prow
3. Khao Soi
4. Pad See Ew
5. Mango sticky rice 
6. Coconut sorbet
Solid Thai food. Pad See Ew and pad Gra prow wasn't terribly greasy. White rice was kind of mushy and not the best quality. Meats were dry but flavors were great across the dishes. Coconut sorbet was so creamy and perfect for coconut lovers.
Waiter was very nice and helpful.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia L.,"I absolutely love this place!!!! 5/5 nothing bad to say.
My friend and I came to PAI on a Friday night with no reservation after seeing all their reservations were booked up. We still went to take our chances with walk in around 7pm and we got a table within 15 mins! It was super busy yet they were still able to seat many of us who walked in.
The place upon entrance looks small but it is MASSIVE inside. The vibes are so good with the decor and the lighting. We both only wanted a main as we needed to leave pretty quickly. Service was super fast and friendly. 
Food:
- Pad Thai with Beef (no chives): 5/5 stars. I was absolutely starving and this was phenomenal. It was not too sweet or sour. It was perfect. Texture was great and portions were pretty big. I could've taken some home if I wanted to but was too hungry.
As we were in a rush, we were able to leave within 45 mins of being there. 5/5!!! Would recommend even if you don't have a reso",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yoland E.,"Though this is one of the most notoriously difficult restaurants to get a table at in Toronto, the lively ambiance and delicious food make it worth the wait! I tried the Laab Salad with beef, which was very flavourful. 
I'm looking forward to trying more menu items here in the future!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel A.,"We walked in around 4:30 on a Friday with no reservation and were seated immediately. Definitely go earlier than later because the place filled up while we were there. People were waiting and the bar and there was a line outside the door. 
Place was cute and our server was wonderful! We got a Thai iced tea and a white sangria that came with an entire lychee in it. Drinks were pretty good.
We ordered chicken satay and the squash fritters to start. The satay had good flavor but the squash fritters were out of this world! The batter was light and sweet while the tamarind-based dipping sauce made it refreshing. We had to stop ourselves from eating the entire basket!
We also shared a beef salad and a papaya salad. The beef salad was good, but the meat was cut a bit too thick. I love my spicy food so I got ""Thai spicy"" for the papaya salad. It was actually not that spicy. The spice was more of a slow burn that built up over time. The rice noodles were a good addition to soak up the juice on the bottom. They were out of shrimp chips that day so we only got pork rinds, which were also very light. The Pad Thai was just Pad Thai. It was good but nothing special. 
I was looking forward to their Thai iced tea gelato served in a young coconut, but it was out so we got the sticky rice instead. Again, it was good, nothing special. I would recommend trying their other desserts instead.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brian E.,"Had an epic meal here last night absolutely loved every single dish I put on the table. We start with a variety of appetizers, including pork and chicken, skewers squash, fritters and they were all amazing. The pork head, a wonderful spicy sweet taste with a little bit of charm from the grill that really made it stand out. Would definitely order that again without hesitation. For entrées, we got pad Thai and pad gra prow. Both of these dishes were absolutely fantastic. Plenty large enough to split with your dining partners. Between the four of us, we had three entrées, eight family style and there's more than enough food. The chicken pant was probably among the best I've ever had great flavor in the sauce and the chicken was nice and tender and delicious.
The star of the show was the coconut sorbet. Served a half coconut comes topped with mango shredded coconut and peanuts, and it was absolutely delible one of the best desserts I've had in a long long time. You're doing a great disservice on yelp reviews for this restaurant and you don't end up dying there. 
On top of the great food, it had a cool funky vibe with the decor the restaurants located in the building and has some community tables and a lot of other quirky seating locations. All the way around.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gary M.,"October 12/2024: Lupper with my Al & Larry/Mary. 
This was a very interesting restaurant. It's in the basement of a building but it was busy as all get out for a later afternoon (4:00pm ish). Bench style seating for the tables and a fast seating. Had our table quickly. 
I had the spring rolls ($14.99) as an appie. They were delicious, crispy & crunchy with a plum dipping sauce. 
My main was Pad See Ew with Chicken ($23.99). This was my first time trying this and it was delicious as well. Very tasty but I should have added MORE spice. 
I also tried a fork full of Mango Slaw ($19.50) & it was very good as well. No complaint about this place except for their lack of menu flexibility. 
It's a do over for me if I'm in the area.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eleanor Elaine C.,"Good Thai food. I bit chaotic for my taste but that is authentic Thai street feel so I can't complain. Staff was good, friendly and attentive. Food came out very social media friendly",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt S.,"Door dashed the Chicken Pad Thai (Medium) and it was very good. It was very good.
I marked the order to include utensils, but it did not. Luckily I had a fork at my hotel so it all worked out.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Robert S.,"My husband suggested this Thai restaurant for dinner and I am glad he did.  When we arrived, there was a line out to give our names for dine in.  I also saw that they were on Open Table, but all the reservations were also gone..so we waited in line and after about 10 min we gave our name.  We were told it would take about 20 min so we headed to the bar and got some drinks.
The place is huge..it has several dining rooms and all of them are ample and very nicely laid out.
Our server was really sweet and nice. We opened the menu via the QR code and we decided on the Pad Gra Prow for my husband (basil stir fried with beef over rice) and the Pad See Ew for me (thick rice noodles with chicken).  We started the meal with some chicken satay.  Everything was outstanding...the flavors were probably some of the best I've had outside of Thailand.  It was a winning dining experience.
Large menu with salads, rices, noodles, soups, etc....please check it out next time you are in the area....well worth it....",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea M.,"The vibe at Pai Northern Thai Kitchen was laid back despite it being a Michelin rated restaurant. Hence the hubs said we had to go.
The gaeng hunglay or oxtail curry was really interesting. The rice was adorably wrapped in leaves. You don't often see such a dish at Thai places. But then I've recently learned that northern Thai cuisine is slightly different. The curry had a sweet and sour taste with notes of garlic and ginger. It was flavorful but not overwhelming like sweet and sour soup for instance. All this was set to a mild spice level.
The chicken pad see ew was delicious. This is one of my all time favorite dishes to get. There was a perfect portion of chicken, veggies, and noodles. But the most important thing was the abundant noodles! The veggie stems in this dish was rather bitter, and I couldn't pinpoint what type it was. The chunkiness allowed you to taste the bitterness which slightly turned me off. It turned out that it was Chinese broccoli. Ha! [Yeah. I don't read the full menu to remember.]
Here's a link to their menu: 
https://paitoronto.com/menu/pai-menu#section5
 
The experience is right around 3 or 4 stars for me. Service was on point despite people whizzing about. The decor and atmosphere was fun and chill. Overall it was good food but at a pricey price point.
Was it worth it? To try a Michelin rated restaurant once, yes. To come back and dine again? Probably not for the inflated price due to its hyped up reputation. That's my take on this anyway...",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike O.,"Pai is a restaurant staple of Toronto. I've been a few times and each time I'm impressed with the quality of the food and depth of flavors in each dish.
The restaurant itself has a very hole-in-the-wall feel to it. It doesn't have an elaborate storefront and the inside has a very casual and cozy feel to it. Seating is also limited considering how popular it is, so I recommend trying to go early to get a seat. Arriving at 5pm or earlier gives you a better chance at getting in without a wait.
The service is good but not stellar in my opinion. The staff is friendly enough but can be a bit slow when they get busy.
The amazing food is what you come for! Every dish I've had I've fallen in love it. Each one crafted with elite attention to detail and has a perfect balance of flavors and spices. The Khao Soi is my favorite as the curry is so creamy and so many levels of flavor.
Overall, Pai has some of the tastiest food in Toronto and is a must-go! I've never looked at Thai food the same way after going to Pai and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Frank F.,"Best Hot & Sour Soup Ever
We popped into Pai for dinner, and we were immediately struck by the vibrant, bustling atmosphere. It was a bit overwhelming at first due to how busy and loud it was, but the energy was undeniably lively. Navigating through the various pathways to reach different rooms and our table added to the unique experience.
The highlight of our meal was definitely the hot and sour soup--it was hands down the best I've ever had. The other dishes we shared were decent, though the menu felt somewhat limited in options.
The staff were mostly attentive and friendly, contributing to the overall positive vibe of the place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ana B.,"In the words of Gen Z, Pai is MID. Pai is on almost every list for Toronto and on the Michelin guide, and there is always a line to get in here. I went on a Friday night during Canada weekend and we got lucky and after getting in line just to get on the waitlist, after waiting 20-30 min, we were seated right away. I am super happy that northern Thai food is getting recognized but I was not impressed with the food. The atmosphere is great - it's vibrant and loud and they have a full cocktail bar. I got a vodka Thai tea cocktail and it was fine. 
The waiter was really lovely and had recommendations, since it was so busy we ordered everything and asked for things to come as they were ready (my sister who I was with is also very impatient at restaurants so it was better for us). 
We ordered: the mago slaw (seasonal) and also a note here, some of the starters are not available until after 4 pm; miang kung  - which is a make yourself wrap, paid thai and PAD GRA PROW, a rice dish with an egg on top. 
I haven't had a decent pad thai in YEARS and this was fine, better than what I've had available, we did ask for a side of hot sauce and cilantro. 
The pad gra prow, was nice, it builds flavor slowly so we thought we didn't like it at first. We did over order, but we were eager to try a lot of the items. 
Overall, if you've had good thai food, you will be disappointed in how hyped this place is - especially since you have to wait in line just to get to the waitlist and they don't answer the phone, I do think there's a email you can write to. The miang kung is fun, and not readily seen a lot of place in the US.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emilia R.,"Great vibes here. They play lots of modern rap music and it helps create a very refreshingly young environment. This place is packed too. There is not much seating and my mother and I had to wait as we were walk ins. Not sure if they accept reservations. But I do know they are card only, no cash. 
I was pleasantly surprised to walk in and see the Michelin star rating posted at the front. I knew this had to be good. 
We had a few dishes, everything was HUGE portions, but as a NYer, I was disappointed and did not find the food particularly special. Ive had better from a hole-in-the-wall in a back alley. I thought my pad see ew was over salted and the flavors just did not vary  much from the pad Thai. 
 
I expected more. Also did not feel like the waiter was overly that great. He plopped down plates and I tried to get his attention a few times but was ignored. It was very busy so maybe he was over stimulated by it.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Haeun J.,"I was EYEING this spot during my travels in Toronto because the line was always around the block and it's on the Michelin Guide. We had to wait in line to put our names down, and they texted us when our table was ready. We went on a Friday night at around 6 PM, and I think it took us about 45 minutes to get seated. I'd say it's a pretty efficient system.
We ordered the Thai Chicken Wings, Papaya Salad, Khao Soi and the Pad Thai. ALL the items were absolute hitters. They were full of flavors and characters but still true to their basics. The papaya salad is one of the hardest dishes to get right because it requires specific grinding of the papaya to give it that perfect texture - Pai's papaya salad was amazing. 
When I come back to Toronto, this spot is one of the firsts I'd visit again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Charlene S.,"This might be a silly thing to say, but I didn't think Thai food could get better than my neighborhood places. I stand corrected. 
This place was on the list because it got loads of great reviews. Didn't know it was a Michelin.. contender? Award winner? I'm still not too sure. Either way, it's well deserved.
Vegetarian review:
Pad see ew-  there was something in the sauce. That was the top difference between this dish here and in other places. It was delicious. There was firm tofu (not fried), plenty of veggies, and great noodle texture. The plate was full and filling.
Panang curry: also very good. It was filled with tofu and peas and... a bunch of other stuff. Again, lots of food with a cute rice wrapped in... betel leaf? Flavor was lovely. 
The wait was well worth it, and beware- there is a wait. We arrived at 5.30pm (on a summer Thursday) and hung around outside (in the rain) for about 40min. On the plus- the time frame they gave was very accurate.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark S.,"Pai is developing a reputation as the best Thai restaurant in Toronto and it is easy to see why. Arriving early in the dinner service on a Friday, we were seated almost immediately. 
The three of us had the Grabong and Moo Ping to start. These were good but not the highlights of the meal. 
The mains were all showstoppers. Chicken Khao Soi, Pad Cha Hett, and Gaeng Massaman with beef. Each more flavorful than the last and bringing a unique palette, from the sweet coconut milk in the Khao Soi to the spice of the Massaman.
I am surprised to see some 4-star reviews here. Perhaps other areas of the extensive menu are less strong? Regardless, everything I ate leads me to HIGHLY recommend Pai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susan L.,"Arguably one of the best Thai food places you can find in Toronto. PAI has been a go to for me and my friends. It's the place I take people to when they're visiting Toronto. The garbong is a must and you can't go wrong with ordering the khao soi. I am also a sucker for any of their noodle dishes that use rice noodles. Everything is so flavourful but not overly salty. 
The restaurant is down a few stairs and it decorated in a way that makes you feel like you're sitting in the streets of Thailand having a meal.
There is always a line but they have a pretty good system and you get seated pretty promptly. Mind you I still recommend getting reservations or coming right when they opened or on weekdays.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren T.,"10/10 they deserve a Michelin Star. They're on the Michelin list, and even though we stumbled upon this restaurant while in vacation they got us seated pretty quickly. We waiting in line for about 20 minutes and then were seated. 
This Thai food was good, it's ruined us for any other Thai. Make this a stop! 
The atmosphere was so cozy. The tables seemed close together, but it didn't feel that way when seated.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laila F.,"Went here for lunch on a Saturday early afternoon. Was seated immediately in a super cute indoor space.
The food blew us away!! We tried:
Thai coffee- 5/5 delicious with generous portions 
Khao soi- 5/5 one of the most delicious creamy curries I had, we got this with tofu 
Papaya salad - 5/5 so good with perfect amount of spice. The mini shrimp were an excellent touch
Pad gra pow- 5/5 our FAVORITE- we got with vegan pork and could t even tell it was not real, SO delicious. we got this Thai spicy which was no joke but so good.
Highly recommend!! Consider coming for lunch to avoid long wait!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Robert C.,"Amazing must try place in Toronto! There is a line outside to put your name down with the host (30ish min), a wait for a table after putting name down (10-20min), and then wait for food after ordering (10-20min) but it is definitely worth the wait. Food was really good and service was attentive and frequently checked in. Ambiance is nice and unique. 
My party got their khoa soi, green curry, and pad see ew, along with an iced thai tea, mango sticky rice, and coconut mango sorbet for dessert. No bad items on their menu, they are Michelin for a reason.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David L.,"When the food is good, the wait will be long even on the weekdays.  Seeing this a Michelin Guide restaurant, I knew I have to give this place a try when in town. It took about 1.5 hour for our table to be ready.  
Food - I think we went overboard when we ordered.  I figured if we can't finish we can bring the food back to our hotel since it has a kitchen.  All the food we ordered taste great.  The spice level is just perfect.  This is probably the best Thai Food that I have ever eaten.  
Service - our waitress is great.  Even though she's really busy she still makes time to chat with us and have us some recommendations when we ordered.  
Ambience- it feels like hole in the wall. Nothing fancy.  But it really doesn't matter that much since the food is more important to me.
Overall, this is a very well deserved to be on the Michelin Guide list.  Will be back next time to try other food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Megan S.,We just visited Thailand a couple months ago and have been thinking about how hard it is to find some specific dishes. Pai definitely delivered with a fun atmosphere with a menu that is hard to choose from. We wanted to try everything! We had the fritters which were flavorful and plentiful as well as a delicious Khao soy and a Penang curry which was thicker than we typically see and so perfect to coat a bed of rice. The coconut sorbet was so fresh and amazing. Everything was delicious and we are only sad that we discovered Pai on our last night in Toronto and could not return!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katie K.,This food was our favorite in Toronto. It tasted very fresh and flavorful. They told us 20 minutes but only took about 5 to get a table. We got are food quick. Would recommend!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa S.,"I'm in love with everything from pai. I don't know how they do it but every dish is cooked to perfection. The flavours are all there, it tastes like it's straight out of Thailand. The wok flavour is amazing in the pad see ew- Smokey, has a touch of sourness which brings out the sweetness and savouriness. It just hits all the flavour notes. The Chinese broccoli has a nice crunchy texture opposite to the soft noodles. Will definitely be back to try more!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Novia E.,"there's a reason why this place has a Michelin award. All of our meals are so so good and coming from LA, I was not disappointed to pick one of my meals in Toronto to go to this place.
we went in on Sunday afternoon and it was pretty packed, but we only had to wait about 5 to 10 minutes. They will text you when the table is ready.  Place is quite large. I didn't notice that from the outside have a lot of tables for the groups and pairs.
All of the food are awesome and I recommend you to go here if you visit Toronto. The staff are so nice too. I didn't try their tom yum because you can't really customize the spicy level and I can't really eat spicy food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fiammetta P.,"Simply put, YES!!! This place is the real deal. I'm constantly on the quest for great Thai food, especially northern Thai food like Khao Soi and this place rocks. It's authentic and vibrant. I lost photos unfortunately but images or words can't do their food justice. Service was ok but the reason to go is the food. If you're in Toronto or visiting, it's worth a try. Go early if you don't have a reservation as the line gets long fast, with that said we were able to get a reservation for two with relatively short notice (on the early side).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle H.,"I came back to Pai after over a year had passed since my last visit.
I ordered the dish I crave and love the most from here: Massaman Curry with Beef. 
Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The flavours were NOT as I had remembered, to the point that I questioned whether the owners/recipe changed? The curry base was a lot more sour. The beef was tough and gamey. The potatoes were slightly undercooked. And the rice completely changed (now sticky rice in a banana leaf; previously jasmine rice which pairs better with the curry). The rice portion size also decreased substantially. 
I used to adore Pai, and consistently enjoyed it for 8+ years. I'm not sure if this was an off day or if their food has permanently changed.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paul P.,"I enjoyed the spring rolls and the Pad See Ew. I like spice and asked for it but I am glad I didn't pour it on. 
The lime, when freshly squeezed on the meal makes it go pop! I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. At first I thought I wanted it spicy but the flavor was fantastic as it was. The lime really made the dish come to life. Pan cut noodles, veggies and I ordered with shrimp but you can get with chicken, beef, etc.
I waited a few days to eat here. I came on a weekday afternoon around 3 and no line. Still full from lunch but no line to wait to get to a table. Full menu, full bar. Service was fast and efficient. Menu is online and QR  odes at the table. No menu handouts.  
Smartly decorated like other Thai restaurants. 
Would highly recommend!! Worth the wait of days and if limited time worth the wait as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,yuvraj n.,"Very crowded place, so make sure to get there ahead of time or reservation if you can. Food has tons of flavor and seasoned extremely well. Ambiance is alright, unique underground place but it's a little crammed. Had a great experience with noodle dishes, soup, and coconut sorbet. Great selection of appetizers and salad was a great start to the dinner!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dennis C.,As usual the food was good and the lineup outside was long (but pretty fast).   Service was busy but decent.  Annoying menu app did not really work so I could not see any pictures-need paper backup!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tony X.,"If you want some tasty Thai food, rich with flavours, in an atmosphere that works well regardless of who you're dining with, Pai is the spot!
I got a Pad See Ew with shrimp, along with a guava juice drink. The meal portion was filling, and I left the restaurant knowing it's a spot I'd love to return to.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nikita B.,"We ended up door dashing to our hotel because they didn't have availability and even through door dash the food was so good, I'm sure eating in person it's probably even better!! We got the basics red curry, pad thai, and crispy chicken and my taste buds were living their best life! Highly recommend - try to get a reservation if you can if not door dash works too :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pranav M.,"We worked up an appetite after seeing cherry blossoms and decided that we were craving Thai food. 
Busy as expected on a Friday, waited only about 20 minutes for a table, had a drink at the bar while waiting. 
Ordered a small Tom yum soup to start very delicious. Pad Thai was chefs kiss delicious also and so was the curry, not a single complaint.
The Scottchie Barnes was a rather small drink (in size and strength).
A little on the expensive side but that's expected with Pai.
Sat at a small table in the middle.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steven D.,"We went here because it was the most popular on Yelp in this area. I learned most popular on yelp doesn't mean the best. We decided to go anyway because we were close. 
I could see why this place is mentioned by Michelin. The vibe cooks. The decor is cute and I could see hanging out here with a group of friends.
This place was also pretty busy. I got oxtail curry because I don't see that in a lot of Thai restaurant menus. The curry had a sour and sweet taste with some notes of ginger and garlic. It was thick and flavorful but not very creamy. It was a mild spice. 
My wife got the chicken pad see ew. She love pad see ew of all types. I think she just likes thick flat noodles. The ratio of chicken, veggies, and noddles were perfect. I ate her eggs though because she's slightly allergic to eggs. 
Would I come here again?
No. Not because I live in US but because I don't think this place stands out as a Thai restaurant.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tabby A.,"Is the wait worth it?? Depends on how discerning is your palate for fine food.  The food tastes very good, but if you have sugar / salt sensitivities you may wish to ask for less sugar / salt in your food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zeke M.,"This was actually a tough one for me! The food was incredible the service was excellent and with the idea of accommodating as many people as possible in the restaurant, I was put into a seat that was fairly tight for a person of my size.... that being said, the atmosphere is really cool but it was tough for me to enjoy the entire experience staring at a stone wall 2 feet from my face. Once again I totally get the need to move customers through and I love the fact that walk in availability is possible otherwise this review would've been at least five..... 100% this is not the last time I will be back to this restaurant! It is absolutely incredibly delicious and if you're on the fence, you absolutely need to go!!! with better seating I'm sure that your experience will absolutely be a five!
Thanks again!!
Zeke",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kathy T.,"4.5 
Came here for dinner and because we were willing to sit at the communal table, were seated right away. Which was actually great because it was a huge table and we had our own corner that was a lot roomier than most tables.
The winning dish was the mango salad- so fresh and flavorful! The other dishes, pad Thai, pad see ew, and Panang curry were all good-I think we were expecting a little more or different with the Michelin hype.
The ambience of the place is very fun and lively-it's in the basement of a building and feels like a semi tropical hideaway. Service was also good.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joann S.,"i got there at 8:30 on a monday night with a party of two and waited only five minutes! 
the inside is decorated really nicely with thai mementos and souvenirs. 
green curry was really good but some of the beef were too stringy and dry. really strong coconut taste (which i loved)! 
miang kung was really good but too little toppings for too many leaves  wish there were a few more piece of shrimp... 
friend said her pad see ew was one of the best she's ever had. 
thai iced tea is a little too sweet for me",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Connie C.,"This place is definitely packed 24/7 and super duper loud!
Came here before 5pm and was told there's already a 20 mins wait.  However, got a text message in less than 10 mins so it wasn't too bad.
The seats/tables were small and I had multiple bags with me so it made it extra difficult to sit.  People also kept walking behind me and knocking off my belongings.  I wish I had the a seat against the wall but oh wells...
Ordered few things to try.  The pork skewer was the bomb! The chicken curry was good but the bamboo rice wasn't enough to finish the whole curry dish.  We ended up ordering another rice to go with it.  The tom yum soup was tasty.  The pad thai with beef was chewy.  The beef was super overcooked and it tasted like liver?  The thai tea was super cold and sweet.
Don't think I'll come back to this location, but perhaps the one in midtown.  We were super thirsty after dinner...",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dena S.,"Amazing food and great customer service!
We ordered 2 main dish and an appetizer and it was more than enough for 2 people.
I definitely will come back here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Irene H.,"10/10 the one thing you have to order is their combination platter. Me and my friend (another girl with a small appetite) shared it and still had leftovers. Everything was delicious, the meats, the sauces in a way that you can't make in your own kitchen.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah M.,"This place exceeded my expectations. By far the best, freshest, Thai food I have had in my life. Service was amazing. Drinks were killer. The food had my mouth watering the whole time. I was excited for the next dish to come out. Ambiance is fun and trendy. 
We ordered the pad Thai, the pad see ew noodles, spring rolls and the moo-ping. Everything was full of flavor, piping hot, and mouth watering. Cocktails were amazing as well - my favorite being the Thai mojito. 
They have reservations available for you to make but I love that they cut back their reservation amount to accommodate more walk in guests. They really know what they are doing. Just a lovely experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arya K.,"Khao soi tasted better the day after than day of imo. Still very good but I wasn't blown away by it. The Thai milk tea was sooo good, I loved it. Server was super nice and the vibes are cute in there.",4

**Pro Tip: This place is POPPING during dinner on weekends. Do yourself a favor and make a dang reservation or be prepared for a thirty to forty-five minute wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jagdish N.,"This place is an authentic northern Thai restaurant that serves up delicious food all around. In an unassuming basement from outside, they have done a great job in transforming the interiors to make it feel warm and cozy with a touches of Thailand all around. The cocktails were well prepared and presented nicely. We had the Pad Thai, Khao Soi and the Pad Gra Prow as mains. And ended it with a Mango Stickt Rice for dessert. The taste was amazing l, well prepared and presented and large portion sizes. All in  all a great place for good Thai food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aiko I.,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.  
We are group of 5. Ordered
Food: 
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken) 
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)
Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli). 
The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick. 
The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".     
Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)
All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick. 
The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Neha A.,"Loved everything about it! I love northern Thai food, and this place delivered. The service is nice and efficient. The space feels fun and trendy, and I love all the decor from Thailand. The food is really really good. I ordered the khao soi with chicken and it was super tasty. It came with noodles and I also ordered rice to sop up the leftover curry. Glad I got to try it and recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer T.,"So good! Dishes were generous and flavorful. What completed the meal were the drinks that combine Thai flavors into a sweet drink. The skewers are solid, reminds me of food home bbq food in my family! Other two dishes had distinct flavors of spicy, sweet, and savory. The space is large and we were able to get a table without a reservation. Would come back again if I'm in the area!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brenda C.,"Hubby and I saw this place on YouTube's ""Worth It"" and we were curious and had to try this place out. Is it all hype or is it ""Worth It?""
I loved the Mango Slaw as I found it refreshing. I loved the textures of the sweetness of the mangos with the crunchiness of the taro sticks and peanuts. It is a must get, in my book. Hubby and I decided to go vegetarian for our entrees. Hubby ordered Tofu Pad Gra Prow which was very good while I ordered Tofu Khao Soi. There was a perfect balance between the curry and soup. The harmonious coconut milk with the stock made it the standout dish with its refreshing combination of flavors and textures. I truly appreciate the notion that they offer plenty of vegetarian food and can make any dish vegan. 
This is a trendy place and you should make reservations on Friday nights as well as the weekends. The service was fast and efficient. They offer dinner specials but the waitress explained everyone at the table would have to order it in order for it to come into effect. The ambiance with live bands on weekends and the overall trendy atmosphere adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the dining experience.  
So the question remains, ""Is it Worth It?"" The answer is unequivocally, ""YES!"" It definitely lived up to the hype for us.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maria J.,"My friend and I wanted to catch up over dinner on a Saturday evening, and she picked this place (as she read great reviews). 
We didn't have a reservation, so we waited in line and the friendly staff at the front took down one of our names. Then we were informed that it would be about 30 minute wait and were asked to wait until our name was called. 
While waiting, we looked around- the vibe was energetic and fun, the customers were eating and laughing. The decor was cool- the lights were dimmed, there were various colourful objects all around to evoke a comfy feel. 
I thought the place was pretty small, until our name was called and we were led to a table by a friendly young lady. The place was huge- there were multiple sections and each section had its own decor! Our seat was at the end section, where the decor reminded us of sitting inside someone's home. 
Our server was a second friendly young lady. She warmly greeted us and showed us the menu (QR code). She said she'll be back to take our order in a few minutes. 
To start, we ordered Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea. For the main, I picked Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken. My friend chose Khao Soi with beef. 
A few minutes later, the Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea came to us. The Shrimp Chips were delicious- they were crispy and lightly salty. The Thai Ice Tea was tasty- it tasted like milk tea with deeper tea flavour. 
Then our mains came and we couldn't wait to eat! For my meal, the blend of veggies, chewy noodles, and the chicken pieces were delicious- however it was a bit salty. My friend enjoyed her meal as well- she said that she liked the smooth coconut curry with blend of spices and the juicy pieces of beef. 
Throughout our meal, our server came by to check-in on us to make sure that we had everything we needed. 
The portions were generous and the dishes and drinks were delicious! Highly recommended!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Audrine M.,"Don't be put off by the not so glam exterior, it's a stark 360 contrast when you enter through the doors. The sign as you enter says 'Voted as the best Thai restaurant in Toronto', I don't know about Toronto but it's by far the best Thai food I have eaten in North America and I eat a lot of Thai :) My group of 8 came closer to kitchen close but the food was amazing. The Khao sui and Pad Si that I had was so flavorful. I wish I had more time in Toronto, I would have definitely come for a 2nd time. Our server was great, too, and service was pretty quick for a large group. Unfortunately, I couldn't try the mango slaw I had heard so much about. It wasn't available. I'm saving this for next time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sydney B.,I was let down by Pai. Got seated on a Monday and place was packed. Waited 45 minutes for my food and came cold. After we were given our food then I asked if we could get silverware. The mango sticky rice was amazing. The drunken noodles were good especially if they had been warm. I have a lot of friends who do takeout from here and are fans but I just didn't get the hype.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lei G.,Stopped by for an early dinner and beat the dinner rush. The service was quick & friendly. The garlic shrimp & ginger beer was a great start to the meal. Both were delicious and the dip for the shrimp was extra tasty. First time trying the Khao Soi with braised beef and was not disappointed. The pickled vegetables and spicy sauce perfected the dish! Ended up taking the mango with sticky rice. Great meal and would highly recommend!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elaine N.,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!
We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!
Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.
I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too! I also wish this place had more variety of food items since it didn't feel like much variety when I went.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Louisa M.,"I was in Toronto attending the annual TIFF film festival, and dined at this restaurant on my birthday. I wanted a nice meal and a break from all the movies, and the large crowd hanging around out front and the hour-long wait for a table reassured me that this was going to be a tasty meal. I put my name on the list and waited for a text that my table was ready. (The hostess asked if we would be okay sitting at a communal table, so be aware if you're super private and would prefer to dine alone). 
The restaurant is in a basement, so it's very dark and intimate inside. It is packed with tables, so you'll run a gauntlet to get to your table. The atmosphere is casual and lively, and it's very loud inside with concrete floors and walls. The decor is casual and fun, with colorful flags adorning the walls and a large bar in the center.
Since it was my birthday, we decided to order a bottle of prosecco that was listed on the menu. The friendly server took that order and disappeared, only to return to say they didn't have any bottles of prosecco, and we'd have to order by the glass. Big disappointment. 
We placed our order for Thai vegetables as an appetizer and we each got their house specialty: Pad Thai. I chose shrimp, my husband chose beef. Our server typed our orders into his electronic pad and disappeared for the remainder of our meal. 
The place was packed and they obviously didn't have enough servers waiting tables, so the service knocks this place down at least one, but probably two, stars. Another thing that really bugged me is that we were charged prices that were higher than what was stated on the menu. I am not sure if this was just the ""tourist surprise special"" or if they have dynamic pricing during special events downtown, but it rubbed me the wrong way. My prosecco per-glass price was almost three dollars more than listed on the menu, as were our entrees. Not cool.  
I also was annoyed by the volume of noise in the place. It was SO LOUD with people screaming to have conversations. This would've been a killer place for a romantic evening if they could do something about the noise levels. 
The food was really good and made with high quality ingredients, so I can't complain about that at all! In fact, I'll definitely return next time I'm in town for the festival. Note: they won't take reservations during TIFF, so don't bother. But do show up at least an hour before you want to eat, it really did take the quoted time for a table to be ready.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cindy N.,"Pai is one of the most popular go-to places lots of locals recommend a lot. Coming into this I had some expectations that it'll live up to the hype. Unfortunately, I found the place a bit overhyped and not mindblowing. 
Pad Thai: Quite average pad thai. It wasn't bad but wasn't really the best pad thai I've had especially since it's a reasonably high price point.
Papaya Salad & Mango Salad: The papaya salad came with shrimp chips and vermicelli. The mango salad had low quantity of mango, was mostly carrots. Was a bit too much MSG on the salad seasoning. 
Khao Soi: The better dish out of all of them. The broth was flavourful and creamy. Everything went well together. Would recommend only getting this and perhaps their curry dishes as it seems like that's their specialty. 
Overall, I had much better expectations for this spot and disappointed that Pai doesn't live up to the hype they receive. Although I will give them credit they have an extensive menu which may be good for groups that have a lot of dietary restrictions. It's not worth the long wait (over 40 mins wait time) or far in advanced reservations in my opinion.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maleewan K.,"Great thai foods. Beware of a wait for table if you come during dinner hours. We can see why this is one of the most popular restaurants in Toronto. The foods were authentically cooked and the service was very good. The mango salads and fried chicken wings were delicious. Laab at Pai based on Northern Thai recipe was delicious, beware that this is different than regular sour Laab that you would usually have at most Thai restaurants. Mango with sticky rice was the best! Great place to eat with friends and family.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny L.,Food quality is always consistent but portion has definitely gone down. Either as a result of shrinkflation or rising cost of ingredients. There was barely lettuce in my salad and my salad had more meat pieces than lettuce. Was very disappointed.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stefani T.,"Great evening for Pai!
We walked in on a stormy night to a full house. But we were seated shortly after and directed to access their wifi and menu online.
We ordered several items...
Mango slaw... favorite dish
Pad see ew noodles with tofu and veggies 
Fried rice with shrimp 
Vegan seafood dish
Pangang curry with tofu and veggies 
Green tea... pretty light in taste but hot which was appreciated on a cold, windy night.
The dishes were generously plated, smokey, and hit the spot. 
The restaurant itself is like walking into a cabana. The music is thumping, the servers are schlepping items back and forth, the tables and bar are buzzing with conversation. It was a fun way to close out our visit to the city.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aram K.,"This seemed to be the most frequently and highly reviewed restaurant in all of Toronto, on both Yelp
And Google, so I had to give it a try. 
When you think of a place like Toronto, your first instinct is that Canadian food would be the most popular. But Canada is a melting pot of cultures, and there's a strong Asian influence here. 
We figured all the rave reviews about this place was reason enough to see what all the hype was about. 
We got here on a Tuesday evening and it was so packed that we waited for 35 minutes!! I couldn't believe how busy it was on a Tuesday. That was my initial indication that I was about to have some good food. 
The ambiance was casual but cool at the same time. Have you ever been to one of those famous people that post famous people's pictures who have visited their restaurant on the wall before? It was very much like that. 
While we were waiting for a table we decided to have a drink at the bar. There were no bar stools which was great because we didn't have to fight anyone for the bartenders attention, so we stayed standing up ordering drinks and enjoying them. We had the Lowry and the Thai mojito, my fiancés favorite was the Lowry and mine was the Thai mojito. Both were Very smooth and easy to drink. 
Once we sat down, the service was incredibly fast which was surprising since it was so busy. We were attended to right away, they would come back
To check on us and if we needed anything, it wouldn't take long to get it. 
We noticed that the most popular item on Yelp was the pad Thai, so even though it's such a typical Thai food item, we had to try it. The pad Thai was really good, we got almost the spiciest level (faraang spicy) and added extra spice on the side but it wasn't as spicy as Thai food in LA where we're originally from usually is. The pad Thai was my fiancés favorite all time pad Thai, I'm a little bit more of a food snob, to me it was a solid 4.5 star out of 5, loved it but I feel like I've had slightly better, but it was definitely top 10 I've ever had everywhere I've traveled. 
We ordered the grabong (squash fritters), even though we read a review from someone saying that it didn't have flavor. Let me tell you, as long as you dip it in the dip they provide you, it is popping full of flavor. By itself without the dip, it's pretty plain. We loved it and dipped to our hearts content. 
I noticed the Khao Soi soup looking dish seemed like my kind of meal, so I couldn't pass up ordering it, and I'm glad I did. There was so much broth that after eating it with the noodles, I ordered white rice and added it into the soup and it's like I had 2 meals from the same dish. And in my opinion it was great with noodles but even better with the white rice!! The flavor was also finger licking good. 
I would love to come back and try more dishes here",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelvin L.,"PAI's OG Location is a spacious basement level facility. Reservations are recommended for large groups as walk-ins for 2-4 can be 30-45 mins wait on less busy days. (i.e. Tuesday 18:00-19:00)
The service was great, they will do their best to note and make accommodations for allergens. Came over frequently to check and the food came quickly after ordering.
PAI's Thai Iced Tea is the most balanced Thai iced tea I've tried so far in TO. It isn't tooo fluorescently orange, nor overly sweet, it has great balance, smoothness, and taste. My go-to for Thai restaurants are the Pad Thai, Thai Iced Tea, Khao Soi, and/or a Green Curry. Everything was great! The Grabong was crispy and a great app and I will be back to try a curry and/or a rice dish in the future.
Order
- Khao Soi Chicken
- Grabong
- Pad Thai Chicken
- Thai Iced Tea",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cin V.,"This is a dimly lit, noisy, and popping place, so be forewarn. I did appreciate that they had a small waiting area and all staff was working efficiently to get guests in and out. The menu is typical of your usual Thai restaurant. The Khao Soi was bit too thick and sweet in my opinion. The egg noodles was surprisingly better than i had anticipated in this dish though. The Thai chicken wings were mediocre at best. Nevertheless, the dip definitely brought this dish up a notch. We should have done without the Pad Gra Prow - crispy pork. Other than the pieces of crispy pork, everything was very mediocre about this dish. This was our first time here and will probably be our last.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adam J.,"Hands down the best Thai food we've ever experienced, including a month in Thailand. 
Thai Villa in NYC was our favorite until we found this gem. Recommended by so many sites, my expectations were high and I was cautiously optimistic. Arriving at 6:30pm, they were already on a 45-minute wait. 
From start to finish everything was incredible and the service was stellar. 
Thai Iced Tea
Shrimp Appetizer
Pad See Ew

Run so not walk!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris V.,"We read and heard that this Is a good thai restaurant and reservation was highly recommended. 
We called and got a message to reserve online. We went online and it looked like there weren't any tables available. We decided to check it out regardless. 
We arrived at 3 pm. Plenty of open tables. We reviewed the menu and realized all the salads were only available after 4 pm. Odd and a major bummer.
For that reason, we ordered the pad phet chicken with extra spicy heat level. It came out mild with side of red chili oil. We asked raw thai chili to give it a kick. The food was expensive and didn't have the wow factor.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy W.,"Had the Thai Chicken Wings, Pad Thai, Khao Soi, and ""The Lowry"".
Overall really great atmosphere, amazing food and customer service from the waiters that served us at the bar. Definitely recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Oscar L.,"Pai has hands down the best pad thai i've had. I can't think of a better pad thai place in both Toronto and the states, even those in LA or NYC. The tom yum is also so flavorful and delicious. The wait can be a while if you didn't reserve a spot. Highly recommend stopping by for some thai food if you're in the city!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Suzanne G.,"Excellent, friendly, and attentive service; cute decor and lively atmosphere; and delicious food. We got the wings, spring rolls (so good we ordered more!), green curry, and a chicken vegetable stir fry dish. Everything was really flavorful, arrived quickly and was served piping hot. Would definitely return the next time I'm in town.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marisa C.,"What a great way to kick off our first meal in Toronto! Since it was the highest reviewed spot we figured it has to be good! We went for a late lunch, around 3:30-4ish. They told us it would be about a 20 minute wait but we only waited like 10 minutes.
For food we ordered the Pai Thai with chicken and the Khao Soi Beef 22 CAD each. Omg you NEED to order the Khao Soi, I could literally just drink the sauce forever. The Pai Thai was good but I feel like I've had better, it wasn't bad just not the best I've ever had. 
Portions are pretty substantial, so you could probably share and get an appetizer.
The decor inside is cool, with fun details. Service was good and staff was friendly. I definitely recommend visiting this place while in Toronto!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katherine P.,"My husband and I were craving authentic Thai food. We searched on Yelp and this was the winner. We had the pad Thai and fried rice. Both of the dishes were delicious with generous portions. We were able to customize the spice level with each dish too. We also ordered the Thai tea. It was creamy, sweet, and refreshing! It paired perfectly with the spicy food  
Overall, the service was great and the staff were friendly.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Irene T.,"Arrived on a Friday night right before going to a musical next door. It was about 6:10pm and there was already a line outside, which signalled to me I should have high expectations as a first timer here. For a table for 2, it ended up being a 25 minute wait. 
Surprisingly, the restaurant inside is a lot bigger than what you see when you first step in. I thought the restaurant only seated all the people I could see in that area which looked to be about 60 people. But when it came to my turn to head to my table, I had to maneuver through at least 2 mini rooms to get to there! Upon my partner's high recommendation, I ordered the Khao Soi Beef for $23. This dish was phenomenal. The soup had right amount of sweet and spicyness, the tender beef melted in my mouth once I took a bite, and the noodles paired perfectly with the flavours. 
One thing I will say is that portion wise, I didn't leave feeling full and had to grab a dinner after the musical because I was hungry again, but I felt like the quality of the dish still deserves 5/5.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Natasha P.,"I ordered the pad pak reum with chicken and it was so good! It was packed with flavour, lots of vegetables and lots of chicken. This is my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto hands down!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Donald L.,"Service was amazing despite an overwhelming amount of customers, we ordered a bunch of dishes to share and for the most part everything was excellent.  The ambiance is a bit loud but warranted given the amount of customers and pub style layout. We tried a number of curry dishes and they were absolutely delicious!  The wings, garlic shrimp and chicken were off the meter. My personal favorite were the northern Thai sausages, the chef pad Thai and the curry oxtails. If in Toronto this place is a definitely must try!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Justin K.,"Great Thai option that I would recommend if you're in the CN Tower area.
Pad gra prow- I ordered the ground chicken and this dish was very flavorful. I frequently order this at other Thai restaurants but none of them have the depth of flavor and coherence between the rice and the flavored ground chicken.
Chiang Mai beef noodle soup- this dish had many components that all sang in harmony. The braised beef was nice and lean without any fatty tendon that normally comes with it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paige A.,10/10 - We had the Cool Mule and my husband said it's the best mule he's ever had. The Ninja Sake beverage was amazing too. For dinner we had Pad Thai and the Khao Soi - SPEECHLESS. 10/10. We might come back tomorrow. The Shrimp Chips were amazing too.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jamie S.,"You can't tell from the outside but this place is MASSIVE 
.. there was a long long but for good reason. The line goes fast and have a coconut water and Thai ice tea was great. Some of the best Thai food of my life. We live in Pittsburgh PA, and Toronto is a five hour drive cool city and this place will make it work the drive.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anny L.,"Our party of 7 came for late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and had no wait. Thankfully we made a reservation as it was still very busy despite it being 2pm.
We ordered the chicken wings (crispy skin), pad see ew (too sweet), khao soi, gaeng massaman, pad gra prow, khao pla twat. For drinks, we got the goji anunoby (light plum wine taste), Thai mojito (pretty), tea mac (no taste of alcohol), and cool mule. Our favorite dishes were the khao soi, curry, and fried fish, all which were seasoned well and had the right amount of spice. 
We love that they could accomodate a peanut allergy among our group and were patient when we didn't know what to order. Unfortunately 60% of the menu can't be ordered until after 4pm which sucked because more of the interesting dishes were among that time.
Definitely recommend this place with a reservation after 4pm!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivian L.,"Came on a Sunday around 5pm and were seated immediately. Visiting from California so we ordered a ton of dishes to try, such as the mango slaw, moo ping, pad thai, khao soi, and the pad gra pow. Everything was excellent!! So flavorful and nothing was overcooked :) We also got several drinks because they were so well priced (but that could be because everything is just ridiculously priced in Cali). Overall, the vibe in here was so fun and lively and will definitely recommend this spot to anyone, even locals!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carrie G.,"Some of the most amazing Thai food I've ever had! Never thought I would find this kind of food in Toronto. Definitely come when it opens because it fills up very quickly. Staff members were very nice. Rustic looking with some traditional Thai elements throughout the restaurant. 
The pad Thai was SOOO good. I have to put it up as one of my top three pad Thai I have ever had. I ordered mine with shrimp. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his khao soi and he said it was also one of the best khao soi he's ever had. Honestly a bit expensive for Thai food but I think it was totally worth trying. Such good food! 
Would highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chithra V.,"Absolutely loved this place! There was a wait time for 25 minutes, but I was called within 5 minutes of joining the wait list. The waiter took the time to go over the entire menu and explained which ones I could go with according to my taste pallete. 
Got to try their lychee cocktail which is Tequila based and also ordered their Pad grow Pro vegan bacon which was out of the world. It's a must try!!  Ambience was good too with enough seating and waiting area",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jesus H.,"My girlfriend and I needed some Thai food in our life while we're visiting Toronto and Pai looked exactly what we were looking for. The place has really cute decor and the staff is extremely nice. They have a pretty extensive menu so there's a little bit of something for everyone. My gf and I started with the chicken wings and orders Pad Thai and Khao Soi. Both were incredible, the flavors were on point for all three items. We grabbed a few drinks and those were fantatsic as well! Prices were pretty good all around and won't break the bank. 
If my gf and I ever find ourselfs in Toronto we will definitely be back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adele L.,"Avoid it.
Unfortunately I didn't enjoy much the food. The wait time is too long and the service is bad too. The platter is a disaster, I simply won't recommend it. It's expensive and only look good for picture.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anila Y.,"This place is soooo hyped up and well known that I was genuinely shocked by how mediocre the food was! We ordered the Grabong appetizer and the vegan panang curry with tofu and veggies. The appetizer was good, but the panang curry was truly the most bland Thai curry I have ever tasted. They also just threw strips of raw tofu in it. 
Oddly enough, the plain rice was more flavorful BEFORE adding the curry on top. If we hadn't been in a hurry we would have sent the dish back. 
Service wasn't great either--lots of snooty vibes.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tim O.,"Lined up 15 minutes before the doors opened for lunch on a Saturday. More than 30 people lined up behind us. This might be the hottest restaurant in Toronto. Many menu items are only available after 4pm and a group of 4 that knows how to eat can cover most of the lunch menu. There is no question, though, that this is a top tier Thai restaurant. Beautiful preparations, bold flavors, the perfect level up for anyone who is looking to emphatically move beyond takeout pad thai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thomas B.,"Everything was fine up until the food arrived. 
They brought our meal to the wrong table that seated quite a bit after us, after their confusion and poking at the meal they picked the food back up and brought it to our table. 
The Grabong was cold, and cold fried food is just not great. The Pad Cha Hett was ok. My wife's meal was a bit salty. 
In the middle of eating a guy came up and tried to take a plate which we were still eating, I had to get more assertive than you really should need to asking them to leave the $25 appetiser so we could finish it. 
Overall, the food is fine. It's not great.
The service is just absurdly dreadful. There is no reason to get cold dishes, and be served food at a Michelin rated restaurant which has been passed between tables and poked at by other people.
The first impression of the service alone I would never go back.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mel T.,"I've had Pai bookmarked in the event I visit Toronto and this time, I finally got to try it. I was excited because I love Thai food, and it seemed authentic but unfortunately, it fell short. I've read there's always a wait and they don't accept reservations so we decided to go at around 1 PM on a rainy Sunday. We were quoted 45 min wait but only ended up waiting about 25. We ordered a drink at the bar while we waited. I had the Thai mojito and hubby had the Lowry. Both tasted pretty similar even though one was rum and one was gin. It's probably because it was sickeningly sweet, so the sugar was all we tasted. 
For food, a lot of items weren't available until dinner time, so if there's something specific you want to try, keep that in mind. We started with fried garlic shrimp, which was probably the only thing we liked. It was perfectly fried/crispy, and the tamarind dipping sauce it came with was nice. For drinks, hubby got a Thai iced tea which also way too sweet. For my main, I went with the Khao Soi with beef. The beef was flavorless - I had to dunk it in the chili oil it was served with. The broth was too salty. I don't think I was even able to eat half the bowl. I wish it came with more pickled mustard greens. Hubby had the Gaeng Hunglay (sweet and sour garlic-ginger curry with braised oxtail). The flavor wasn't bad but overall still a bit too salty. It could have used way more rice.
Maybe the dinner experience is different/better? But it's not worth the wait/trek/money for a lunch.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lela A.,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linda W.,"Amazing food as always! There can be long wait times so go early and put your name on the waitlist. 
The dishes were all very flavourful but I did wish that the Gaeng Hunglay had slightly more meat. I got the mild spicy which wasn't very spicy at all so if you want more of a kick, I'd recommend medium spicy! 
The ambiance of the place has more of a hole-in-the wall feel, with colourful decor in a lively setting.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rosa H.,"One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to hands down. The restaurant is busy and lively with a bit of a wait, especially at peak hour. However, my boyfriend and I got seated within 20 minutes of putting our name down - thanks to the 90 min table limit!
We waited at the bar as we waited for our table. I got the goji anunoboy which was so delicious - very light and refreshing especially being out walking around the hot summer day. My boyfriend got the Mango Sticky Rice IPA which was perfect for him.
Once seated, our server was very attentive and great! We ordered the papaya salad which was SPICY! It was delicious but definitely with a kick. You can ask for your own spice level, but we went all in. Very delicious and super flavorful- highly recommend. 
For our entrees we ordered the pad gra prow and the khai soi. The pad gra prow was phenomenal, literally the best I've ever had. We ordered this with crispy pork and at a farang spice level. It wasn't as spicy as the papaya salad but this is definitely not a dish to pass up. Literally dreaming of this and want to go back to get it as I write this review!
The khao soi was delicious as well and coconut-y if you like that! It comes with red chili oil on the side to adjust your spice level. The broth was fantastic and super creamy and sweet. Highly recommend as this was a staple and everyone around was ordering it!
Definitely recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paul H.,"Excellent food.
The Panang Curry, Pad Thai and Mango Slaw were highlights. 
Loved vibe. They do good trade because they do good food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chely Y.,"Very authentic northern Thai cuisine. The main attraction for this place and probably worth the 45-minute wait is the food. However, the service at this downtown location is sub-par. First, the cocktail I ordered was ""lost"" (server's exact words) which was why it took another half an hour to get my drink. Then, another server dropped a whole tray of food and drinks, very close to our table. I understand that accidents happen but none of the servers even bothered to check if I was hit by the broken glass or bothered to offer me a napkin or paper towel when the drinks spilled over. Considering this restaurant was credited with a Michelin-mention (not rating), I wish the owners and managers would strive to offer better service to match their food.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Xiaolin L.,"The Khan Soi was so good! Very flavorful! Perfect to go with shrimp. The server was so nice and accommodating! I asked if I can get any sort of veggies, he helped to serve a side veggie even it was not on the menu. Very impressed by this restaurant overall experience!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mary C.,"The place was a bit out of the way, in an alley way, and it's in a basement.  We had a little bit of a confusion finding the place, but oh boy, it was sure worth it. And now I think the location is part of their charm.
The food was excellent.  We have been to many  thai places , and this  place is a cut above the rest. 
The commonly known Pad thai, this place managed to put a twist to it and made it a bit different. It was so good. The green curry was delicious!  And they served it in a coconut. The pork skewer was also good, but it was a bit too sweet for my taste. The rice they gave with the green curry was wrapped in banana leaf and tasted like pandan.
The service was excellent.  The vibe was hip.  We will be back when we are in town again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katja K.,"Hands down the only place you should be eating if you're near Union. For the price, you get so much delicious food and the indoor decor is uplifting. Everyone I know in Toronto raves about Pai and for good reason. They have curries, noodles, rice dishes, etc. you can pick your spice level to customize each dish. Come here and make a reservation because I've heard the lines can be crazy!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Manny L.,"Pai was absolutely packed on a Tuesday at 6PM. I made a reservation a month ahead of time and was promptly seated. 
I ordered the Khao soi (4/5 with beef, and the presentation was quite something. The broth was rich and creamy, with strong tastes of coconut. The beef was fine, and the egg noodles were thick and meaty in a good way. My girlfriend got the pad Thai (2.4/5). It was a pretty average pad Thai, nothing special about it. 
The service was below average, and we were seated in a corner and kinda forgotten about for large periods of time.
Overall better than average Thai food, but not quite hitting the right notes for me to earn a 5 star experience. Slightly overhyped.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sandra K.,"The place was decorated really well with a tropical theme. It was about an hour wait for our party of 6 on a rainy Wednesday evening in November. The waiting area is very small, most of my family had to stand. I ordered the chaing Mai beef noodle soup, they give you a good amount of meat, and it was very flavorful. I tried my boyfriend's Khao soi (chicken and noodles in coconut milk curry) and it was so creamy, it the best thing I had eaten all month. I recommend dining here, and definitely make a reservation ahead of time.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tiffany C.,"I loved all of their appetizers and drinks.
However, I was a bit disappointed with their pad thai and pad see ew because they were overly seasoned and extremely salty. 
Servers were very attentive and kind. 
Hesitant to give it another try.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Preston I.,"Really enjoyed the experience I had at Pai! I got the chicken fried rice, which was very good. There was a wait, but it was definitely wait. Would definitely come back here again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alicia P.,The restaurant is popular with local Canadians and it didn't disappoint. My favorite was the curry oxtails and Pad Thai but I feel it's too busy to preserve highest quality of dishes.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bob C.,"Visiting Toronto and our wonderful hotel attendant suggested Pai if we liked Thai food. Happily we do, so off we went on a lovely walk a few blocks to Pai. 
The place was happening and nearly packed. There were many people ahead of us waiting and we decided to wait as well, knowing it was close to 45 minutes before we should be seated. This is where 1 star is removed. There was no bar service in the waiting area nor could you order an appetizer while you waited. 
It looked like they had ample staff to bring drinks while you waited but it is what it is. 
At exactly 45 minutes we were called and brought to our table. The menu is excellent with many wonderful choices. We went simple as the waitress suggested the classic Pad Thai. We had vegetable Pad Thai and chicken Pad Thai. Both were fantastic with a flavor different from what we know at home but also wonderful. It was worth the wait. 
Back to the scene. Great old classic rock and pop music was piped in and the energy of the diners and staff was ""On."" At 17:00 on the tick, doors opened to expand to a larger space with a full-on bar and cool clerestory windows if you will. This place is actually half a floor down from street level. The daylight brought another level of energy and excitement to the place. I think this would make a massively cool place to hang out with a group of friends, enjoy great food, and a few drinks. 
I'll be back next time in Toronto!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John P.,"Made a reservation for 8 on a Tuesday night at 6pm a month in advance because their reservations open up a month before your desired date. They gave us the private room in the back which was really nice because we had our own privacy and they had  a lot of Thai artwork in the room. Although it was a Tuesday night, the restaurant was packed to the fullest and there were a lot of people going in and out. Highly recommend a reservation!
The service was great! We at least had like 3-4 employees check on us throughout. They were all really friendly and welcoming.
The food was really yummy and lived up to the hype, but was it the best Thai food I've ever had? Not so much. Some dishes like the garlic chicken and garlic shrimp didn't really have flavor. It was just breaded and deep fried. The standouts were the green curry and the papaya salad. 
I'm glad I tried this place!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brian B.,"I researched the ""Best Thai in Toronto"" and on every site I saw Pai was at the top. Needless to say I had to try it, and I am thankful that I did and that I ordered in advance. The line outside was waiting with anticipation and I now know why.
My first experience was disappointing because the garlic chicken was not available. However the garlic shrimp was! And thank you food Gods. It was delicious! I also ordered the Pad Thai I held off on the spice BIG MISTAKE because I would've never done this nor have I until this visit.
Despite not having the spice the Pad Thai with chicken was packed with flavor.
As for the Ambiance j my brief visit, this place is a vibe and a half. I don't live in Toronto but when I'm back I will surely visit!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy R.,Great food service and atmosphere!  Highly recommend to check it out when in Toronto Thank you for a great time,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Albert K.,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice
The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.
Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.
Shame there was no thai iced coffee.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Francesca Z.,"Deliscious, cool ambiance, great service. 
Get there a little early to get a spot. We had a short 25 min wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shaun L.,"This Thai spot is a little pricey but very good. Strongly recommend reservations and there are two locations if you can't get a reservation. Dinner menu starts at 4pm so if you want mango sticky rice, wait until then. They are cashless, so bring a credit card and your phone has enough battery to browse the menu.
Drinks were interesting. Wifey got the Lowry which was delicious. It was like a limeade, although I couldn't taste the alcohol. I am not sure if the drink was that ridiculously good or just weak. I got the scotch Barnes which is a Hennessy cocktail. I love Hennessy but I didn't enjoy it unfortunately. It was a little spicy and tasted a little medicinal. Maybe the Lowry ruined my taste buds*shrug*. 
For the entree's we got the shrimp pad see yu and the oxtail. The pad see yu was one of the best I've ever had. It wasn't overly sweet and had plenty of shrimp and veggies. Being Chinese, the only thing that would've been out of this world is getting enough wok hei, although it came close. I love oxtail so I ordered this. I'm used to carribean style oxtail and viet oxtail so I was intrigued by this style which is a sweet and sour. It was different but good. The flavor profile was good but I prefer the savory and tomato oxtail or the curried versions more. There was plenty of oxtail and the rice is served in banana leaf which was fun and great presentation.
I would def come again, I would try the khao soi next time. That seemed very popular but I couldn't turn down a chance at oxtail. I would def order the pad see you again!
Avoid scotch Barnes, get the Lowry, get pad see yu, oxtail is solid. Smokey somehow. Would try khao soi n",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steven W.,"Having lived in Bangkok and being married to a (Chinese) Thai wife, I consider myself somewhat of a Thai food aficionado. As such, I could expertly proclaim that Pai has some of the absolute best versions of Thai dishes produced outside of Thailand: specifically their pork skewers (moo ping), Northern Thai sausage and khao soi were all top notch, beautifully presented, expertly seasoned and composed of the highest quality ingredients. And it helps that the location is cavernous, slightly divey (in the best sense of the word), with Thai signage and photos of all their adoring celebrity fans. Well worth the trip!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katherine G.,"The BEST khao soi I have ever eaten. If you get one thing here, I would highly recommend giving your taste buds a treat and ordering this dish. I was recommended Pai by quite a few others so I knew I had to try it on my visit to Toronto. We arrived at around 6:30pm and it was around an hour wait before we got the text that our table was ready.
The inside is really cool and has a great vibe. Our table was in a more secluded area which was actually really nice. Service was fast and friendly, and after ordering we didn't have to wait too long for our food but long enough to know they were making it fresh. 
I got the khao soi with tofu and veggies which came with a good portion of wide egg noodles, tons of tofu, and a good variety of veggies in the signature broth. It was also topped with crispy egg noodles as well. The broth was so so flavorful and had the perfect balance of sweet, savory, and spicy. It was soaked up so well by the noodles and was absolutely delicious! 
I completely understand why this spot is so popular! Definitely be prepared to wait if you arrive without a reservation, but it's certainly worth it :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda W.,"Ordered delivery and the food arrived still piping hot. I ordered excellent dishes, all with amazing flavor and hit the spot immediately, especially during a snowy Toronto night. 
- Seasonal Mango Slaw salad, I could've gone without this, the portion was so large! It could have just been my main dish! But this was very fresh, thin slices of mango, carrots, onions all tossed in a delicious lime and fish sauce (Yum!) was only able to finish half of this!
- Gai Satay (chicken), there were 5 skewers, and was in a delicious curry sauce and they homemade their peanut dipping sauce!  
- Panang Curry with Chicken, this was my main dish, but the portion was so small, the Mango Slaw size should've been reversed with my Panang Curry! 
Overall, the flavors were amazing, delicious and totally hit the spot! Loved this Toronto Thai spot!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emma B.,"Everyone said we had to eat here while in Toronto. We arrived ten minutes after opening on a Saturday afternoon. I'm not sure how large the restaurant has and how many rooms but it seemed already pretty full when we got there. We were sat straight away. Service was decent. You use the QR code for the menu. A lot of items aren't available til after 4pm - which is a shame. I had the Pad See Ew with shrimp which was delicious, the rice noodles were great, I like that they gave you the spice on the side so you could add your own heat level. My husband didn't order well and went with the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup, he was looking for something like Drunken Noodles which is what my dish was similar to, he wanted wide noodles and messed up! Lol. His dish was still good but not what he was looking for.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nancy G.,"Came here on a Wed night and it was busy due to TIFF. We waited about 20 minutes for our table which was great! They have a lot of seating that goes to the back of the restaurant. Everything we ordered was so delicious! You can order the level of spice you want. Our server was helpful in describing the menu and gave a suggestion for dessert which is a must, coconut sorbet in a coconut shell. If you want Thai food with authentic taste and great flavour you need to go to Pai!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zachary W.,"Ambiance was sick af, the decor and atmosphere is nice. Food was so good even before the full menu after 4 pm, excellent service as well, have to visit if you in Toronto",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erika N.,"I came with a few friends for dinner on a Monday night. Our wait was about 35 minutes which wasn't too bad. We had a drink next door while we waited. Once we got the text, we went back and got seated. I honestly didn't expect this place to be as big as it was inside. I liked how colorful and fun it was, very trendy.
The menu had quite a few options and they did a great job with accommodating my gluten free friend too. We started out with the garlic chicken which I loved. It was juicy, crispy and flavorful. It didn't have a huge garlic taste at all so don't let that scare you. Next I shared the shrimp pad thai. This was great too, really flavorful and big meaty shrimps. Finally, I shared the beef khao soi. I really wanted to like this more than I did, but the beef just tasted so dry to me. Maybe with a different protein it would have been better. 
Overall it was good. I did feel like our sever rushed us a bit and wasn't the most friendly, but the food was still good which made it worth it.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gary Q.,"Great food, drinks and service. Loved this place so much, we went back twice! Definitely worth the trip and will be back once I return to Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mohamed K.,"One word - INCREDIBLE!
The ambiance, service and most of all the food is amazing at this place. Hands down it is one of the best Thai restaurants I have been to (and I have had Thai around the world).
Definitely go for the tom yum soup as it is wonderful in any weather. I will hands down say their Panang curry with chicken is absolutely amazing.
I look forward to coming back here on every Toronto layover I have.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,ALEXANDRA L.,"Excellent food. Papaya and mango salads, pad see ewe, spring rolls, refreshing cocktails. Casual and festive decor. Efficient staff. Highly recommend. But maybe expect a wait (even at 2 on a Sat. Afternoon)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nance W.,"Llike this place a lot .. it is actually bigger inside ..but dont like how you need to make reservations way in advance, at least a few months in advance because they closed off their limited reservations as restaurants tend not to hold up tables for the busiest dining time and they rather you do walk ins.. which can be a hit and miss.
Also some area are just too noisy.. you can't have a conversation.. food is good though so go when it is not as busy, which is rare LOL",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cathy C.,"Yelp Review 2023 #26:
When in Toronto, you MUST come to Pai. If you're thinking whether to have lunch or dinner here, pick dinner as they have more items only served during dinner service.
Certain regions of Thailand use certain ingredients. The southern part like their food spicier compared to the northern part. The popular dish in Northern Thailand is Khao Soi so, naturally, that's what I had to get.
Khao Soi:
A bowl of egg noodles in a golden coconut milk curry m with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions, and your choice of protein ((Braised Beef, Chicken Breast, Shrimp, Tofu & Veggies (contains shrimp paste), or Vegan)). I opted for chicken. They'll give you a side of chili, and lime to adjust the flavors. By itself, it's a little bit sweet. 4/5
Pad Ga Prow:
Rice dish with stir-fried holy basil with your choice of Ground Pork, Crispy Pork (Moo Grob), Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, or Tofu - topped with a fried egg. Served with nam prik nam pla sauce. Spice level of your choice (No Spice, Mild, Medium, Farang Spicy, or Thai Spicy). The crispy pork was the perfect choice. Man, I'm drooling as I'm reliving the moment I was eating this dish. 5/5
Do make a reservation way ahead of time (a month ahead because Open Table will not let you make a reservation more than that). Once you are seated, they'll let you know you only have 90-120 minutes to eat. But stress not because the food comes out quick. So, my suggestion is to look up their menu before coming here and know what you want so you don't waste time trying to decide what you might be interested in. Also, they have multiple locations so, make sure you go to the right one.
Due to their popularity, the service seemed rush. Not the best but not the worst.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brandon T.,"I was so excited to visit a popular and known spot in Toronto when I visited. I'm also a huge fan of all things Thai so my expectations were high. 
My party shared a variety of dishes they were known for including the pad Thai, beef curry, Moo ping, as well as the mango sticky rice. I thought all the dishes has nice flavors and nice presentation. I also really liked that they brought out a variety of items to enhance the ! I will say the only pain point was that the portions of the dish was smaller than I expected for the price but I can move past that.
Service was good, and helped at every request! The ambience and layout is something else, I thought the inside was only the main lobby but actually is like 2-3x the size I originally thought!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David H.,The food is so good. Oldies decor and music are fun and enjoyable. Service is great. Did I mention the food was good??? Definitely try the chef favorites on the menu.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marysa M.,"Grabbed takeout from pai after a long day of traveling and it was exactly what we needed. The Pad gra prow had so much flavor and was perfectly balanced between the chicken, veggies, and rice. We had the khao son road too and loved it. It was difficult to eat since we were in a hotel and the takeout came in two separate containers. Loved the spring roll with mushrooms too! 
Their online ordering wasn't available at the time and we had to call 3 times before we finally were able to get through on the phone.",5

Great food and service.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle D.,"Back again at Pai!
Got their pad gra prow with beef - thai spicy! and it was the perfect amount of almost uncomfortable spicy but still quite spicy. It was super flavourful and the portion was okay for the price. Also tried my friend's spring rolls and they were good. Service was great as usual. We came around 4pm on a weekday afternoon and were seated immediately so come early if you don't have a reservation or else you may be lining up outside.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erin L.,"So good, it kind of ruined Thai food (non-Pai) for me forever
Waited about a half hour on a Saturday afternoon. Seems a little silly to have a waiting space when it could just be more seats, but it works and you'll find people waiting. They offer a call back but I'm visiting from US so we opted to wait. We were just about to order our Thai teas from the bar when we were seated - wish there was more encouragement to take advantage of the bar while waiting, but I digress
The Khao Soi is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The presentation and the lightness of the curry go hand-in-hand to a really special experience. It's pretty big and can be shared. We also had some skewers that were so moist and tender. Yum yum!
This was also just peak experience for us - the restaurant is so cute and so much to look at. The staff is extremely kind and friendly too, they even gave us some city recommendations. 
Yeah I can't eat from any other Thai restaurant again. Thanks a lot you guys (sarcasm here)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Travis J.,"Food was outstanding, the pork skewers were the star. Food came out quick and service was good. I will definitely be back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cashmier C.,"Delicious! If you're in Toronto you must visit Pai. They don't take reservations so there's going to be  a wait, but it's worth it. There's a bar area you can wait in, but there's not much seating. This place is pretty big and it gets packed. We waited about 45 minutes for a table for 4 on a Friday night. The staff provided good customer service during our visit. The highlight was the food. Everything was so flavorful and fresh. The spring rolls, spicy fried rice, pad Thai, chicken strips and Thai tea were my favorites. Enjoy!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Afrin K.,"Amazing northern Thai restaurant located in downtown Toronto! Waited outside for around 20 minutes, but quickly sat down after checking in since I was a party of 1. Ordered their vegetarian Khao Soi, and had outstanding flavor! Couldn't stop drinking the soup broth- highly recommend! If you're in downtown Toronto, wouldn't miss this spot!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Winnie H.,"Come back again for dinner. Very popular place and good vibes. The server is very efficient to serve. The dinner only allows 90 minutes per table. Once found you are almost done, he will deliver the bill ( that is only 60 minutes) .
The Khao Sai is good. Its curry is very rich. Tom Yum Kung also has strong flavour and have 4 big shrimp in it. Only happen that the soup is not very hot even it is served under a small fire.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela T.,"Pai might have been the most recommended restaurant to us for our trip to Toronto, and it definitely lived up to the hype!
My boyfriend and I came in on Saturday for lunch and we arrived right before a huge rush. They limit you 90 minutes to dine in, which is plenty of time given how quickly the kitchen pumps out dishes! Between the two of us, we ordered 5 wings to share, pad gra pow with crispy pork, and khao soi with shrimp. 
Wings - Not as crispy as advertised, but the sauce it came with was nice and sweet! Was still delicious, but nothing to rave about. 
Pad Gra Pow - ALL OF IT. YES. I couldn't stop eating this dish despite how full I was, but every component of this dish was perfection. The crispy pork gave the dish a little bit more bite and the fried egg was just perfection! We ordered it mild, but didn't taste any kick to it, so if you're a spice lover, definitely order it spicier. :)
Khao Soi - The broth was creamy, coconutty, and very very fragrant. The noodles were cooked perfectly and still had a great bite to it. I loved the addition of the crispy noodles for a little extra texture. The broth was really rich and was the perfect soup for a chilly afternoon! 
Can't recommend Pai enough and definitely coming back for the next Toronto trip!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Courtney O.,"This review is for take out because I wasn't prepared to wait around for this popular joint! Even in the early evening, the line was long with many people waiting their turn. 
I understand why! I don't know that I've tried Northern Thai before but I could definitely tell there was a slight difference in the way things were made in comparison to my usual local Thai joint. 
We ordered the pad thai, khao soi and pad gra prow. Everything was very full of flavor! The pad thai was my favorite. It wasn't your typical pad thai. It was filled with different veggies and just had so many different textures and tastes that lit up the tastebuds! The food was absolutely fantastic and takeout was a great option to avoid the wait!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danan R.,"Very solid Northern Thai with an excellent spicy beef noodle soup, grren curry, and pad thai.  Their takes on the classics just have that extra boost of umani which take them to the next level.  We also tried the penang curry which is a sweeter than most versions and less creamy - so your mileage may vary based on your preference.  They are perpetually packed and a walk-in table may take up to an hour, with reservations hard to come by.  They will offer to text/call you so you can wander around or grab drinks elsewhere while waiting.  We ended up ordering from Uber Eats, which took only about 30 min.  Worth checking out if you are Downtown.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,JP P.,"SO and I stopped here for lunch and although it was a tad bit pricy, everything was prepared well.  We started off with the garlic shrimp, which were nice and flaky and came with a tasty sweet tamarind sauce.  SO had the beef noodle soup, which was perfect on a cold day, and I had the panang chicken, which was tasty and hit the spot. 
Bottom line, the service was fast and the food was tasty.  We'll probably venture to a different Thai restaurant just because there are so many of them that we haven't visited, but it's good to know that this place does Thai well.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cameron A.,"One of my favourite restaurants in the city. 
Always fresh, friendly, fast but not rushed.
I am always impressed with the theming as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Xun W.,Great experience. Came here both before COVID and post pandemic. Nothing changed. Will recommend to friends coming to Toronto,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Scott S.,"This is a neat place in the basement of a building in downtown which sets the atmosphere well. I was by myself and got there around 415P so I didn't have to wait for a table. By the time I left, there was a line starting to make its way up the stairs to the street.
At the recommendation of two servers I got the Pad Gra Prow with Moo Grob (crispy pork). I got it one step below Thai spicy. It was excellent. There was good flavor and the perfect amount of spice. As I ate, my mouth wasn't on fire but there was still some heat. The ground pork seemed to carry most of the spice.
I also got a Thai Iced Tea. It was really good too. 
I don't make it to Toronto often but I'll definitely stop here next time I'm in town.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristin Marie S.,"Toronto really delivered on the food scene and Pai was no different! We had the Khao Soi and Pad Gra Prow. I miss these dishes. Thai in Nashville is not great. Thai in SF was great. Pai in Toronto was like wrapping myself in a warm blanket just out of the dryer. I wish I could Goldbelly it. Can I? Is that an option?? Both dishes had so much flavor. The consistency of the Khao Soi was thick enough, but not too thick. The PGP's egg was cooked perfectly, the meat was the same, and the sauces and flavorings blew me away. It's now my favorite Thai dish. If done well, it's all I want to eat.
The space was really wonderful too. It has been transformed form head to toe. What was most amazing was that we were clearly not regulars. The guy next to us ordered the Khao Soi. He slurped down all of it once he was done, he went to the bathroom and changed shirts. This guy understood the assignment. My poor husband had a napkin around his neck trying to contain the splash back. Come hungry, their portions do not disappoint!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Luayy A.,My expectations for this restaurant was out of the world. It really was so delicious. I really would love to come back the ambience the food the service was outstanding. I love the attention detail and that they were very knowledgeable about their food.,5

Q: So when you're visiting a city for the first time, and you'll only be in town for a few days, how do you decide where to go for dinner on a free night?
A: Easy, you reach out to that city's Yelp Community Manager for recommendations. That explains how we ended up at Pai Northern, on the recommendation of the Yelp Toronto CM Janice Y.
Quite a few Torontonians share Janice's favorable opinion of Pai Northern -and here's why I'm saying that. We walked in at a quarter to five on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. We grabbed a cocktail (Clear Peach Cider for $9) and waited about 20 minutes to be seated. By the time we sat down, the dining rooms seemed to be at 99% capacity, the bar was jammed up five deep, and the line to check in went all the way up the stairs to street level.
My dinner choice was Pad Phet Chicken and my wife went with Chicken Pad Thai. Both portions were enormous. Half of each came back to our hotel room for lunch tomorrow
My Pad Phet was fantastic! It was a delicious stir fry of chicken and king oyster mushroom in a red chilli paste with snow peas, bamboo shoots, Thai basil leaves, sliced ginger, and peppercorns on a bed of sticky Jasmine rice. It was a magnificent dish.
It was only offered as ""mild spicy"" so when I asked for extra spicy, our server Renz brought out a small bowl of nuclear hot chili oil. It should have been served with an eye dropper, because just a little dab'll do ya good.
Our two cocktails and two dinner entrees ran $64.41 before tip. 
Thank you Janice Y. and Pai Northern for a fantastic dinner.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ritwika B.,"I had heard about this place since a long time but didn't get a chance to visit until a few weeks back! 
Pai is known for their delicious Northern Thai food and have a few locations spread across the GTA. We went to this location and had to wait for 2 hours straight for a table on a Friday evening - so take a cue and book reservations well in advance! 
The service was really decent and we were told the table was allotted for 2 hours. 
Coming to the food we got:
 Pork skewers - was delicious!
 Starter bowl of tom yum soup - just to taste it! 
 Khao Soi - the classic! Didn't disappoint but the gravy was a little too runny.
 Gaeng Massaman - Personally did not like the flavours in this one.
 Chef Nuit's Pad Thai - quite spicy, but flavourful!
Finally, the showstopper according to us was the Coconut Sorbet ice cream. It came inside a tender coconut served with chunks of mango, peanuts and grated coconut. I was so happy to see this since it took me back to the feeling of having tender coconut ice cream back home - the taste was SO good. This ice cream is perfect to share between 2-3 people. 
Overall, this place is a must visit if you love Thai food or want to give it a try for the first time!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristelle B.,"We are visiting Toronto from California and some friends recommended this restaurant as a must-try! It didn't disappoint and reignited why I love Thai food in the first place. Probably one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever had in this side of the world.
We came on a Sunday night around 7 pm with no reservation. We were told that waiting time would be an hour but it only took 25 mins! The space is huge, vibrant, and very alive! Perfect for group settings. 
WHAT WE ORDERED:
Thai tea -- textbook, perfect Thai tea! Comparable to Cha Tra Mue in Thailand. 
Khao Soi -- this creamy, coconut-based stew with noodles is so comforting for the frigid weather in Toronto. Each sip is brimming with rich flavors! We chose chicken as our protein though shrimp sounds amazing, too.
Pad Gra Pow -- with crispy pork belly and stir-fried ground pork, topped with the most perfect fried egg. *chef's kiss* we overestimated the spice level and just went for mild which didn't have much kick into it! But good thing they serve chili on the side so you can take it up a notch if you want to.
Coconut sorbet -- rich, thick, and creamy coconut sorbet with nuts and mango and coconut meat. Wish it came with more mango chunks but it's already perfect as is!
Serving-wise, dishes are huge and good to share. We want to come back next time for their moo ping and Thai green curry! So many promising options on the menu. Definitely recommend this place!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vineet S.,"I went there for dinner with colleagues. The wait was too long (55 minutes) for a table of 3. The service was excellent once we sat down. 
For food, appetizers were good; entree tasted good, but I felt there was some plastic in my grounded chicken. It was actually prawn shell in the Pad Gra Prow Chicken. 
I am feeling really bad after eating it.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sana T.,"Great food, great service! We went on a Tuesday night and there was about a 50 min wait. There's regular table and communal table which we got sat at. It's perfectly fine! 
The food was absolutely delicious! The panang curry and pad kra prow were my favorites! The thai spicy level was so spicy!!! Would recommend farang spicy or medium if possible. 
The coconut sorbet was absolutely delicious!!! Great way to end the night",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jess L.,"Went for an early dinner on a Wednesday at 5:00pm and the wait was about 35-40min. We got drinks (definitely recommend the Scotchie Burnes, so tasty!) and looked at the menu while waiting for our table. They take your number and text you when your table is ready.
Outside there is a nice waiting area with tables and chairs.
The Khao soi was delicious, I'd recommend getting extra noodles or a side of rice if you order it. My friend who got the Pad See Ew liked it. My other friend got a braised beef rice noodle soup which was good but she liked the Pad See Ew better.
We ordered as soon as we were seated and we're given a 90 minute time limit. Most of our time was waiting on the food to arrive but we left well within the time frame given. Halfway through our meal there was a line up the stairs waiting to put their names down for the dinner rush.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shelley W.,"THE BEST THAI FOOD I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE
This place has won many awards in the past and it definitely lives up to the hype. My party of 2 waited about 35mins for our table. Check in with the host and they'll text you when your table is ready. 
F O O D :
+ Tom Yum Soup 5/5 - Welcome to flavor town! Very pronounced shrimp flavor, packed with veggies and slightly sour. Oh soo good!
+ Garlic Chicken Nuggets 5/5 - Golden, crispy chicken nuggies that were fried to perfection. The dipping sauce was bright and acidic. Paired perfectly 
+ Beef Salad 4/5 - Our waitress recommended this. Super refreshing salad if you still want a little bit of protein with your meal. Limes were definitely used in this dressing. Super light and refreshing as well
+ Pad Thai 5/5 - Solid pad Thai if you've never tried it before! Some other places overcook the noodles so they're really mushy but not here!
D R I N K S :
+ Sangria 5/5 - DELICIOUSSS! 
AMBIANCE :
The restaurant was A LOT bigger than I expected. They have a mix of high tops and regular tables. They were playing all the 2000s hip hop jams during the night so it was super fun being there. 
Overall amazing experience! Super sad they don't have a location in LA but that just means I'll have to come back someday :D",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivian L.,"Was recommended to try this place while I was in Toronto and it definitely did not disappoint! I had the khao soi which was seasoned perfectly, though I wish they gave us a little more chili sauce because I like my soup spicier. I also tried their Thai tea which was also phenomenal. My only complaint is that the portion of khao soi was ample but not generous and I was hoping for a larger portion given the price. We came for lunch on a monday without a reservation and had to wait around half an hour. Overall, the service was great and I would definitely recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anthony C.,"I've been to Pai once before several years ago for a friends bday and I didn't really like it but can't remember why.
When my friend suggested eating here, I wasn't really that excited but went anyway.  What a difference! The flavours were much more authentic than what I remembered.
We ordered the fried tofu nuggets and it came with a dipping sauce. They were ok nothing special here but to be expected for deep fried tofu.
Tom yum soup had good flavours with balance of spicy, tangy and spicy kick finish. It was served in a stainless steel vessel, probably was traditional but it made it little hard to get to fish out the soup, but you know small stuff.
We also ordered the Northern Thai platter. Came with squash fritters, pork skewers, ground pork and lettuce for a wrap and pork sausages. The pork sausages were the real star. They were moist and juicy and bursted with authentic Thai flavours which was surprising.
The green coconut curry was ok. I usually don't order green curry (prefer red more) but the flavours were there. My only criticism is it was served in a young coconut bowl and it was hard to scoop it out. Had to ask for a small ladle to get at it.
Overall, I enjoyed the flavours more this time around. I would come back if I was in the mood for Thai and in the area.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bev K.,"Pai is an institution in downtown Toronto! There's always a line and it's frequented by locals and tourists alike. I honestly love taking my out of town friends to Pai because it's close to most attractions and the food is very delicious. I always get the Khao Soi but sometimes mix it up with Pad Thai, pad gra prow, and pad see ew. 
Will it be the best Thai food you'll ever try in your life? Probably not but the vibes make up for it. Seriously check out the place if you're in the area. Always find myself going back...must be the food and people. Haha.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amit P.,"The food was amazing and very cleverly displayed. The food here is amazing. I'm always up for checking out new places during my travels. This restaurant was not that close to the hotel but we walked over and then took an Uber back. If you're hungry, try to get there early because there will be a line to get in. Our server was amazing as well, one of our appetizers came in after our entrées already arrived so there was no issue canceling the order.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tricia K.,"Wow!!  Had to wait about 50 minutes for a table but the food was worth the wait!  We had:
SPRING ROLLS
Three deep-fried vegetarian wheat paper wraps filled with mushrooms, glass noodles, carrots, and bean sprouts served with a sweet and spicy Thai chilli sauce.
KUNG TAWT 'GARLIC SHRIMP
Six deep-fried, breaded black tiger garlic shrimp served with a sweet tamarind sauce.
GAENG PANANG
Thick panang curry sauce with makrut lime leaves, Thai basil leaves, red bell peppers, and coconut milk. (contains shrimp paste and dairy).  We had it with chicken and it's served with jasmine rice.  It's a little spicy but totally bearable.
PAD GRA PROW
Holy basil stir-fried with beef and it's served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a Thai-style fried egg. (contains oyster sauce).  Nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chilli & lime) is served on the side.  We poured the whole thing on our dish and mixed everything up!  Ordered it mild.
CHEF NUIT PAD THAI x 2
Red-flame stir-fried rice noodles in a house-made tamarind-palm sugar sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, long leaf coriander, shredded cabbage, fresh lime, and house-roasted peanuts.  We had it mild with chicken.
THAI ICE TEA x 2
THAI MOJITO (mock tail)
Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower.
The appetizers came quickly but the entrees took at least 30 minutes.  I loved the food!  I normally don't like nuts in my food so I usually don't eat pad thai even though my family likes it. This pad thai was so good that I think I'll have cravings!  It was the best pad thai that I've ever had!  The panang curry was perfectly balanced between sweet and spicy!  This restaurant is definitely a must try if you're in downtown Toronto!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Robert K.,"Amazing so perfect and great food we expect to go back again and again 
Soon as we do we will try the other items",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny L.,"Pai is my favourite place for Thai food! I came here after work and lined up around 5ish on a Friday and it wasn't too bad. I was told that there's a limited seating time and was worried since my other guests are arriving late. 
The restaurant was fully packed and we had to wait awhile to get service. Luckily I knew what my other guests was ordering so we just ordered ahead. 
By the time my guests arrived, food wasn't ready yet. I've also noticed that the price has increased since the last time I've been to Pai. 
In general, you cannot go wrong with the butternut squash fritters and the khao soi. Both were fantastic! For the butternut squash I felt like we needed extra sauce. The khao soi was also big portioned that I had to get a takeout box, this was probably like 3 servings for me. 
Overall, I do enjoy the food however I thought the service was a bit lacking. When I left, the line was so long that you'd probably have to wait over an hour. 
I'd recommend going early or going at another weekday.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,William P.,"We came here on our last day in Toronto.  We all enjoyed our meal.  I tried their Grabong appetizer, which is available only with dine in.  It was delicious and wish it was offered locally in my town. I will have to make another visit to Toronto and will definitely put Pai at the top next f the list.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Spunky C.,Pretty awesome place and we had a super friendly waitress who found a way to store our luggages for us while we ate. Their sticky mango rice is the bomb,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mag T.,"Overhyped!!!
Food was good here but not the best Thai I ever had. This place seems to just be busy at anytime. Came in on a Sunday at 630pm and was quoted 35-40 minutes and it actually only took about 20 minutes. Walk in only no reservations.
If you sit close to the bar it was a constant cluster of people bumping your chair and walking by. 
We ordered the butternut squash fritters, they did not have any flavor just tasted like a crunchy veggie. We were between that and the papaya salad. Wish we would have ordered the salad instead!!! 
For entrees we got Gaeng Panang and Pad Phet Chicken both were good but not amazing like other reviewers say.
Service was nice and friendly. 90 minute table limits. Overall dont be sad if you dont eat here.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Montana B.,The restaurant was vibrant and the staff was fantastic. I ordered the spring rolls to start which were delicious and the pad Thai which was just as good. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lina L.,"We came in on a Saturday and it was very busy. We were told it would be a 25 minute wait, but were seated within 10 minutes. The waitress/waiters are all very nice and attentive. 
We got a thai iced tea which was probably one of the best ones I've ever had. I got the green curry which came in a coconut and jasmine rice on the side. It was perfectly spiced and tasted delicious. We also got Khao Soi which was creamy and light. 
I would definitely recommend this place if you ever in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hing Ling T.,"What we had

Taste: 4/5
The main dishes were awesome! The broths were rich in flavour and really comforting. The beef noodle soup was my favourite. I highly recommend that!!
But for the skewers and milk tea... tbh we expected more from a Michelin restaurant. The skewers were a bit overcooked and the milk tea was a bit bland.
Vibe: 4.5/5
I love the decors! The wall of photos at the entrance could be a photo op.
Service: 3.5/5
The queue was long (about 45mins). Make sure to make a reservation in advance.
The servers were polite but also pretty busy.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karen Q.,"We arrived at Pai around 4:30pm on a Tuesday, in a party of two, and was told the wait would be up to 30 minutes. Since Pai is located in a great location to walk around and sightsee, we walked to the CN Tower while waiting for our text that our table was ready. Our wait ended up being around 20 minutes, we were seated towards the back and the noise level was low. 
The menu is online via QR code. We ordered the papaya salad and khao soi to share. Service was good, the waiters were attentive. The food was excellent. My only quibble was the broth for the khao soi was rather warm (in temperature) rather than hot, I was pretty out off by this but the taste was good. I was pretty blown away by the papaya salad, such a refreshing taste!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John L.,"if you love thai curry, get this! saw it on one of the netflix food travel shows and been looking for it ever since. i don't have this back in my home town.  the egg noodle plus deep fried egg noodles is amazing in this broth. add the the pickled vegetable for an occasional crunch and acidic tones. easily, this dish has climbed to one of my favorite soup and noodle dishes. 
went during lunch hours on a weekday and was seated fairly quickly. service was great. food came out quick and drinks were refilled quickly.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Barbara K.,"the food was amazing, and the service was great. my only suggestion is that the Tom Yum needs just a little more spice to taste proper. 
great job thank you.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alice Y.,"Good food, but maybe not as great as the 5 star reviews say. The dark wooden interior housed a fun and lively environment: crowded, casual, and loud clanking of cutlery. Our party of 4 waited about 30 mins during weeknight dinner rush.
I ordered a Thai mojito (rum, lemongrass, basil, lime, butterfly pea flower). While it was pretty to look at, and the flavor of the mix was good, the alcohol seemed watered down. I only buzzed despite drinking on an empty stomach.
My Gaeng Hunglay oxtail curry was salty, sweet, sour, and a little smoky. I could taste the garlic and spices. Unfortunately, the curry was too salty, which undermined the complexity of the flavors. The oxtail meat was tender and fell off bone, but it was also studded with bits of broken bone. Not only did this interrupt the eating experience, but I also thought it was a choking hazard. The portion was also huge, so that's a plus.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tania L.,"It's been a few years since my last visit but this place doesn't disappoint!! The quality is as good as it was pre-pandemic.
We ordered the gabong / kabocha fritters to start - I could eat these in place of fries any day. They're perfectly crunchy and sweet. The tangy dip served with the fritters is the perfect accompaniment. 
I then got a pad gra prow and was amazed at the portion size! It was so big and generously. The egg was crispy with a soft yolk, and the meat was so flavourful but not too dry nor saucy. I loaded my dish up with the fish sauce on the side. So delicious!
I also had a bite of my friend's beef khao soi. I've forgotten how rich and creamy and deep the soup is! I've only had the Mo Thai one, but it simply doesn't compare. Theirs is sweeter but lacks the depth of flavour as this one. 
Service was also impeccable - our server continuously refilled our glasses and was so attentive as to even notice that my friend barely touched her dish (she was feeling unwell).
I definitely want to come here more often!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ian E.,"I absolutely love going here. You walk into a really great environment and will be dining on some of the best Thai in the city. 
Service is great, you should expect a line to get in as it is always busy. But once in they are attentive and quick. 
I had the Pad Gra Pow and it was just too delicious and very filling. There is a wide range of options to make everyone happy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Becky G.,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.
On the positive side the server was good.
Don't know if I would return.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Iris F.,"Tbh when I saw this was the most reviewed restaurant in Toronto I had my doubts about whether it'd stack up to Thai restaurants I've had in NYC, but it for sure exceeded my expectations. Everything we had for lunch here was FIRE and we were so sad that we couldn't get a reservation for dinner bc there are so many other items on the menu that are after 4pm only. 
We got in line ~10 min before they opened on a Thursday and there were already at least 10 people in line, but there's sufficient seating inside so we didn't have to wait. Ordered the tom yum soup (appetizer size), green curry with fish,  pad thai, pineapple smoothie, and fresh coconut juice. Tom yum was the perfect level of spicy (as in quite spicy but not intolerable) and so packed with flavor. Fish in the green curry was so extremely tender it p much melted in my mouth. Pad thai was prob the best pad thai I've ever had. The drinks went perfectly with the heat of the savory dishes and were super fresh and delicious. If I ever come back to Toronto I'm 100% coming back here!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Caitlin A.,"Went here for dinner based on yelp recommendations for the area - It did not disappoint!!!!!! We went in a saturday night. Expect a long wait. It will be worth it. You can put your name down and hang out at one of the other nearby pubs. 
The food was outstanding. Best Pad thai i have ever had in my life. The spring rolls were also excellent! Everyone in my party loved their meal and everyone wants to eat there again tomorrow! 
Our server was so sweet, she laughed at our parties silly jokes and was timely. The ambiance is perfect too. 
Everyone needs to check this place out!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason M.,"Best Thai food we've had in a long time. Loved it, short walk from the Sheraton. Thanks Yelp for this restaurant!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maria M.,Delicious food!! Drinks were good as well. Definitely recommend making a reservation as they get packed. Fun atmosphere.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pat L.,"We are THAI FOOD LOVERS, and this place lived up to its reputation.  Every dish we had was wonderfully executed, from the laab and skewers we loved at the start, to the perfectly executed pad ka prao... It was wonderful.
Also highly recommend the Khao soi, it's not easy to find everywhere and it's dinner as well as in Thailand.
The cocktails had awesome NBA raptors names, and more awesome flavor.
Lastly we finished with mango sticky rice that delivered as one would hope!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nadine F.,"i grew up more familiar with bangkok style (aka more central) thai food and khao soi was always harder to find. because of that, the first time i ever had Pai, i was SO excited!!! and rightfully so! the khao soi is a very solid dish.
would i say this is THE BEST thai spot in the GTA? maybe not? but i definitely understand the hype behind it.
for my taste, i can tell there's added sweetness to the dishes. growing up, my parents and the aunties and uncles would equate sweeter-than-they're-used-to thai dishes as making the dishes more palatable for the western taste. honestly, i don't think there's anything wrong with that, but my personal preference  is less added sweetness/less sweet flavors and more sour&spicy.
service is always great whenever i come here! whenever my family visits, we always take people to Pai because we all grew up with thai food. so far folks have enjoyed it and we've had very prompt service from the host desk through to paying the bill, even when the place is packed!
the decor is super fun and feels reminiscent to street markets in thailand in regular seasons. for halloween (at least 2022 & 2023), i've seen some clown-type thing at the front which is VERY scary for me, so i think i'll avoid Pai near halloween season. i only add this detail to let other scaredy cats like me know so that they're aware :) if you're not faint of heart, you'll probably be absolutely fine with the festive october decor.
OVERALL:
- solid spot for thai food, despite being sweeter for my personal taste
- great place to bring friends
- usually busy, but great service
- it's called Pai Northern Thai Kitchen because Pai is in northern thailand! expect northern style dishes if you're familiar with thai cuisine!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela W.,"Holy cow, this might be my favorite Thai place! My friends and I had the chance to eat here recently, and simply put, I'm obsessed. We made a reservation and showed up early, but it turned out that we had made a reservation for the wrong day. Thankfully, because we came right around opening time, they were really kind about it and fit us in even without a proper reservation. The restaurant was really busy when we left, so I definitely recommend making a (correct!) reservation for the best experience. 
I usually don't care too much about restaurant décor but this space was GORGEOUS and deserves some recognition! I loved how thoroughly and nostalgically it was decorated. We learned that the décor is based off of the chef's Northern Thai upbringing. This restaurant is bigger than it looks! The host took us through several winding rooms to get to our table, and each was colorful and creatively decorated, from trinkets to folding screen room dividers to posters to ceiling garlands. There was a display case full of memorabilia near our table, and it was a cool glimpse into Thai culture.
We didn't order that much since we were not too hungry, but judging by the tables around us the appetizers were quite popular. I got the Kanom jin nham ngeaw, which was a pork rib and tomato soup with rice noodle. The rice noodle came on the side in small bundles, which was a first for me. I threw them into the soup where they were able to loosen and separate. The broth was incredible! Super savory, complex, bright, and slightly pungent. It's quite rich because of the stewed pork ribs, so I found it even tastier with a squeeze of lime juice. There was a large portion of meat, all fall-off-the-bone tender. 
Pai is some of the most unique and well-executed Thai food that I've ever had. It's on the pricer side for Thai food, but the experience and the food are well worth it. This is definitely on my list for any future Toronto visits!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diya S.,"Amazing food, everything is very tasty. Don't miss out on the salads/slaws. Full vegan option for almost everything on the menu, with tofu and mock pork. Only downside is they don't take reservations, you'll have to put your name down and wait... or try takeout!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jetrina M.,"This place is delicious! We went around 430 pm and there was already a line, although the wait was less than 10 min. I ordered the khao soi with beef and my sister got the pad gra pow with pork. Food came out quickly and server was very attentive. They do tell you when you get seated that it's only 90 minutes, which is kind of weird but I guess they are really busy so need to tell guests upfront.
The khao soi was so flavorful! The curry was smooth and had a coconut flavor but wasn't too strong. The beef was also cooked very well. We ordered drinks at the bar as well since we thought the wait would be long - I got a lychee drink called the summer dog and my sister got the tea mac which came with Thai tea. Two drinks and two entrees cost about $75 CAD, up to ~$90 including tip so be prepared to spend if you want drinks and food! Their drinks definitely tasted great so would recommend.
We walked to Thai location from the waterfront. Parking overall in this area seems tough. It is nearby the subway /TTC line 1.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel L.,"I got the pineapple slush and a chicken pad thai. I enjoyed both items! Not sure if it's the best I have had, but it was flavourful and the portion was big. 
I came on a Saturday afternoon and waited about 15 minutes for a table of four. The food came out fast and the service was decent.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kennedy M.,"literally amazing - this place is popular for a reason. reservations are hard to come by, but i recommend trying to snag one. they do take walk ins, but expect a wait.
we went all out when we came here and tried a bit of everything. our server was great helping us choosing what to get!! 
all dishes were extremely delicious and we left FULL!!! 
prices are what you would expect for downtown toronto.
more of a special occasion place than your everyday spot, but nonetheless we will absolutely be back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maia E.,"Pai has to be my ultimate fav Thai place in Toronto. The wait time is crazy though. I wish you can make reservations. Oddest thing is when we got our table
there were so many empty tables around us yet people were lined up outside.
Interior ambiance:
Super cute and very Asian decor. The place is huge and has 2 other seating area. It looks small when you enter. 
The washrooms are so tight. I'm small and I had to squeeze into the stall to close it.
Food:
Food is 10/10 so so good. Very flavourful! My fav dishes there are the Pad gro and the Pad see ew thick noodles. The prices definitely went up $19+ a dish is pretty high.  When you do take out you get more food I noticed.
I took off one star for the wait times and the prices are quite high.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ann B.,"I found myself unexpectedly alone for 8 hours in Toronto. Thai food sounded great and the reviews on Yelp were good, so I decided to try Pai Northern Thai Kitchen. It was packed, but since I was solo, I was able to be seated quickly. It was delicious! Service was wonderful! I absolutely loved the whole experience. The staff and ambiance were welcoming and fun.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lucia P.,"I was craving Thai food during my recent visit to Toronto and had Pai come up on a few searches. I was in the area and decided to come by. It's a nice location with great decor. Our server was mostly nice but also felt a bit awkward with the service. We started with spring rolls. They mention mushrooms are in it and I asked him whether it was small bits a lot of mushroom. He said small bits. I'm not a big fan of mushrooms so I wanted to double check. We ordered the spring rolls, vegetable pad Thai, and a Thai iced tea. 
The spring rolls were mostly mushroom so the server's information was not entirely accurate. Nonetheless I had them and the dipping sauce was pretty good. The Thai iced tea was very fragrant and overly sweet so struggled to drink it. The pad Thai was pretty good. It was a generous portion with a good amount of vegetables. The curry smelled so good that I instantly regretted not trying it. Maybe on my next visit!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nikki M.,"My friends and family kept raving about Pai, so I finally had the chance to give it a go. Reservations were full, but we were able to get a walk-in table within 15 minutes on a Thursday night around 6pm. Despite it being a bit early and a weeknight, it was quite busy. They have a lineup outside to put you on the wait-list and check your vaccination status during COVID times. Service was very good overall! 
We ordered lots of appetizers and three entrees to share. The entrees weren't really it for me (someone in our party who has been here before did say that their food quality changed that night, so maybe they were just busy?) but the apps were really great!! I especially recommend their grabong and moo ping. I had their chicken khao soi and it was a bit dry... Their Thai iced tea was great  though!
Overall, prices are a little pricier than other Thai places, but their food and service make up for it! Definitely a go-to if you're in the area or visiting Toronto.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Priyanka B.,"One of the best Thai food I have ever had and I'm a Thai food lover! Tried their pad Thai and the khao soi-- too good, definitely coming back for one more meal during my current trip. 
Note to the management- Perhaps you can have a reservation system, that could save a lot of people a lot of time and going and checking out other places.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linh N.,"I'm from LA. Thai food is an abundance there. This place is solid. Very busy. We waited almost an hour and we got there at 3pm. The food is great. Everything tastes decently good. Everything was well prepared and flavorful. Was it amazing? Not really. If I lived nearby, I would eat it often but it's nothing to come back to Toronto for. The service wasn't great. They're nice but they seemed to forget about us. We had to go after them for things and to order instead of them checking in on us. 
Tom yum soup (3/5; very average)
Garlic chicken bites (3/5; very crispy)
Tofu bites (4/5)
Pad gra prow spicy with crispy pork (5/5; flavorful; the crispy pork is eh)
Pad see yew shrimp (5/5; no complaints)
khao pad Baan nok chicken (3/5; average)
Thai tea (3/5; average)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bojan P.,"I really used to love this place.
the prices recently have gone way up, I got order for takeout. It was ready when they promised, took about 40 minutes. 
I got massaman curry with chicken. It came out to 20$ before tax and tip!!! 
The food was underwhelming, the sauce did not have much flavour. For someone who is sensitive to spicy food, this was very bland.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gayan P.,"When I moved to Toronto and was asking around about Thai food, this was the place that I kept hearing about. It was hyped up to be the best Thai food around.
Toronto has a lot of good Thai food and picking a favourite is not easy. I can't say I have done an exhaustive comparison either, but I can say that this place lived up to the hype. Everything we ordered was great. Not a single item missed the mark for my taste buds. All of those enchantic flavours of spice, sour, and sweet that Thai food combines so perfectly were very satisfying.
I heard the backstory of the couple that started Pai and their Thai food empire in Toronto. Given how good this place was, I am not surprised. Thanks for letting everyone experience these wonderful flavours.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tiffany O.,"This is the place I go to when I have tourist friends coming to Toronto. Pai has great vibes, drinks, and food. It has a louder hustle and bustle vibe which gives a more authentic experience. The decor is on point and there's even a table section where you can sit cross legged on pillows on the ground. It's really fun. The food is delicious and you can't go wrong with anything whether it's pad Thai, khao soi, green curry, and squash fritters. Their Thai iced tea is addictive. No reservations so it's always a wait so come during non peak times, if you can. The service is also fantastic. Highly recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elaine W.,"Extremely popular Thai restaurant. Highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time or be ready to wait quite a while during dinner time or anytime on weekends.  Their food is always delicious. I personally really like their pad Thai and green curry and fried fish lunch special. This place is quite big inside and has very colourful thai decor inside. Sometimes, it's a bit too loud here to carry a conversation with friends but I think that's just a personal preference.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle P.,"Love this place!  Brian and I had our first date here.  I started to fall in love with him and I definitely fell in love with Pai!  Living in Los Angeles, now Florida, traveling all over, my fav Seattle Thai place (Thai Tom) was dethroned for Pai Toronto!!!  Incredible food and drinks, great atmosphere, and a consistent line out the door all confirm that Pai is outstanding.  Try the spicy P cocktail... and if fortune shines on you - mango sticky rice is outstanding!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Theerawat K.,"Almost every plate is real Thai authentic. But Khao Soi was modified, I think it's too sweet. But the others are superb. Service and environment are very good. It's worth to wait a long time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sheena Y.,Finally got to try this place and I was glad that I didn't have to line up long to get a table.  The pad Thai was okay. I feel like I can get that anywhere else.  My favorite dish there is actually the khao soi.  The broth was the bomb.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Colin W.,"Went to Pai on July 31st and I'm not a Thai food person. However I found this dish tasty, although I had to have it mild. Service was good and food came to the table pretty quickly. Ambiance was kinda hip as well.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah R.,"We actually vacationed in Toronto to eat here. We had visited once before and when we had a chance to do a spur of the moment trip, we picked Toronto and came back!  
We ate there twice and each time just took suggestions from the bartender and waiter. I bet we have had 80% of the menu and have never had anything we didn't like!
Go, explore all the dishes, and enjoy!  Can't wait yo go back here!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sohail M.,"We got here late at 9:30pm on a Saturday night.  A good size restaurant with plenty of seating and a variety of decor, really liked that.  About 70% full, got seated immediately.  A mostly young crowd at that hour.  
We chose only main dishes as the kitchen was closing in less than a half hour.  A Basil Thai stir fry and a Penang curry, neither of which are specific to northern Thailand.  The Penang curry with beef was about average, not enough zing to the sauce, and it was not served hot enough, I let that pass due to the lateness of the hour. The stir fry presented nicely, very colourful, once again though served only lukewarm.  
Wait staff were extremely friendly and professional.  I wish we had ordered something more specific to the North of Thailand like the khao suey and so can only give an average rating to the food due to the taste of the dishes we did order, but give an excellent rating to the ambiance, service and value.  We will return for another taste.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sakun S.,Everything was so delicious.. Finally was able to get into this restaurant. Go early around 5pm! Great good. Great time. Kinda pricier than other Thai places but for once in a while it's good!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grace R.,Amazing Thai food! Wait can be a bit long during peak hours and by the time we sat down a couple menu items had already sold out for the day. But service was great and food was incredible!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mellani L.,"I only had one night in Toronto and this was where I went for dinner after a friend recommended it. It did not disappoint and I can see why my friend recommended it. The high rating speaks for itself.
I'll be honest, I did little to none when it came to researching this restaurant prior to visiting and I think it made it that much better.
I had no idea what I was getting myself into. This place was definitely interesting, you walk in and head down the stairs to check in. Despite coming on a weekday there was still a 30-minute wait. There was a bar that you could order at while you wait.
The atmosphere made it feel you were transported to a different place. The music was playing loudly but I didn't mind and actually enjoyed the music selection.
Finally was seated and I ordered a Thai tea and pad gra prow. Oh 'em gee, it was so delicious. I wish I could have ordered more but I couldn't fit it all in my tummy. 
The service was good just as much as their food. I would definitely come back if I ever return to Toronto. I actually dream about their food. Ugh Toronto, you guys are quite lucky with this gem.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melisa M.,"Such a festive, neon & lively dining experience. Definitely come in with a reservation or be prepared to wait 30+ min (longer if you're more than a party of two). Big plus that you are welcome to warm up at the bar until you get that ""your table is ready"" text. The Thai mojito is especially aesthetic with the butterfly pea flower & garnishes. The classic Thai iced tea also looked especially delectable. Overall prices are good if not on the higher end, and the food is on the less traditional Thai side.
On to the food: we ordered the papaya salad, Tom yum soup, Khao Soi (very popular dish here) and the garlic tofu. Beautiful plating and quite quick service. The favorite was definitely the Khao Soi - which is was tangy, creamy, soupy and noodly. It comes with your choice of protein. I asked for an extra spicy papaya salad - which is usually my favorite dish - but found the dish to be a little lacking & bland. The shrimp chips were delicious. 
Would definitely come back when visiting again - especially with a group of friends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angel Y.,"Good food! We chose the most classic dishes since we weren't too familiar with Thai cuisine. 
We reserved a month ago before going, but if you go at 12 when they are just open, there are plenty of seats left.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve Cullen ..,"In Toronto for a couple of days and showed up Friday at 6pm with no reservation (four of us). The place was hopping busy! Offered a ""community"" table and we said absolutely! 20 minutes later we were in! 
I thought $14.00 for three spring rolls was a bit much but we ordered them anyway. They are about THREE times the size of a normal fried spring roll! 
My teens split the kow pod (fried rice) and loved it. I got the Pad ka Prow chicken and it was delicious. Been eating Thai food for 40 years and always order this dish. Hands down Top 5 ever. Flavor was superb, portion was great, and I ordered Thai spicy and it didn't disappoint. 
My wife got the Beef Yum Nuah. She wound have preferred more like juice and fish sauce but it was solid.
This place has it going on! Very cool atmosphere as well!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jared A.,"I arrived at the restaurant and was seated at the bar immediately. The staff was fantastic and helped me choose my dish. 
Enjoyed everything about my dinner at Pai Northern. I had the Pad Gra Pow with fried pork belly, it was the best Thai dish I've ever had. With dinner I enjoyed a ginger beer and for dessert the coconut ice cream. I would come back to Toronto just to eat here!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Myka P.,"We had a delicious dinner at Pai after a long day of sightseeing. My group of 5 was able to walk-in and be seated after a short wait. The decor felt like a family restaurant you'd see traveling in Southeast Asia, where I'm from, which made me excited for the meal ahead. 
To start, I ordered the Tea Mac and it was perfect. All the flavor of a thai tea with the buzz of vodka. My group shared the Moo Ping, which was smoky and the right amount of savory and sweet. I had the Gaeng Hunglay as my entreé and wow this was stellar. The pork belly was amazingly tender and the curry was thick and savory. I was also able to try some of my friends dishes and I loved the Pad See Ew and the Khao Soi. 
Overall, this place is a must-try if you like Thai food and want to experience the delicious cuisine of Northern Thailand! Pro Tip: Come after 4pm as there are some items that cannot be ordered before 4pm!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica H.,Really nice and sweet place with cute decors and colourful food. Wait time might be long during busy hours.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen C.,"Some of the best Thai food in town
Service: N/A - ordered food through a delivery app, order was accurate
Food: The Chef Nuit Pad Thai is an almost-perfect balance of sweet, savoury, salty, spicy, and sour, reminiscent of classic Thai cooking. It seems a little bit more tangy and less sweet/spicy than I'd like, but the flavours and ingredients were all there. They didn't skimp on the noodles and sprouts, but they did on the shrimp/protein. The Thai Ice Tea was really strong, but the portion is a bit small for what you pay for (perhaps due to delivery). 
Overall: A great spot for authentic Thai food in the city, definitely try to visit in person!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David L.,"Food: 4

Service was good, although I wish I knew they weren't seating for lunch that day.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Qme L.,"Best meal we had in Toronto! They get sooo busy. The first night we tried to get a table around 9:30 pm but were turned away since there were already 11 other parties waiting to be seated and the restaurant closes at 10 pm. We went the next day at 5 pm and the wait was about 20 minutes. The place was so good, we had to stop by again before we left Toronto! It's a very popular place, so definitely don't go super hungry because there will likely be a long wait. The good thing is that they have a waiting area and you are able to get drinks from the bar while you wait. The service is attentive and efficient. The food takes a very long time to come out. On both occasions we waited 40-50 minutes for our entrees to come out. The wait staff were great about filling waters and keeping us updated on our food status. 
I loved the ambience. It was cozy but didn't feel cramped. For drinks I tried the Lowry (a bit sweet for my liking), cool mule, spicy p (my favorite but was very smoky and spicy), and the tea mac. We ordered the pad thai, pad see ew, and the pad phet chicken. All were very flavorful and good portion sizes. 
Will most definitely be visiting Pai again the next time I am in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Omar W.,"Phenomenal , I had the kho soi it was delectable , service was great and friendly. This pace lives up to the hype and is worth the wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cynthia Y.,"Overall the service was good. We did have to wait a bit but not too long. The food wasn't bad, a little too salty for my liking but taste-wise, while not authentic it's not bad. We ordered shrimp chips, stir-fry seasonal vegetables, pad Thai, pad gra prow and pad see ewe. The server was very friendly and accommodating.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alicia D.,"First place we ate on a trip to Toronto and we were so pleased! The vibe is so unique, like an underground restaurant! We were lucky to come at a time that it wasn't crowded so we sat right away. We enjoyed a pot of tea that was served promptly. We had the spring rolls that came out in like 30 seconds! They were perfectly crispy and fresh! The sauce was a perfect match for them too. I am a big pad Thai fan so when in Canada, that's what I got and I was so happy with my choice! The portion was great, not too much and not too little. The beef was perfectly cooked, the noodles were light and tasted fresh. The ingredients came together perfectly! I got medium spicy because i am usually disappointed that it's not spicy enough. This was a perfect level of heat for me, made my nose run but it was so good! My mom got the PAD PHET CHICKEN and enjoyed it. She was unsure what to get and took a shot in the dark but was happy with her choice. She felt it was a little on the spicy side, although she was told it wouldn't be but she still liked it. We are so pleased that our hotel recommended this location! We may even be back before we head back to the US.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jocelyn Y.,"Good place, but it is certainly overhyped and not worth waiting over 30 mins for. No complaints as I've always enjoyed the food here. However, there are plenty of Thai restaurants that are just as good if not better.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Liza F.,"Excellent food! Great ambiance, good service. The drinks were as good as the food. Big portions. Parking is a challenge. But other than that is was a great experience. Definitely will come again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jade L.,"Made reservations for uptown but decided to take a chance with a ealk-in for 2 at their Duncan location. We were so lucky and only waited 5mins for our table.

We tried:
Lobster pad thai
Eggrolls
Tom yum soup
Khao Soi w/ shrimp and tofu
Thai iced tea

Everything was AMAZING!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Richard F.,Very nice lunch option for convention goers.  Tasty options hard to decide on lunch but we all enjoyed our meal,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joe K.,Amazing restaurant. Couldn't get how full the place was after only being open ten minutes and we didn't have to queue or wait to seat down. Lots of options. Great dining experience. Great food.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,B F.,"Food was incredible 
As a tourist I felt welcomed and at home
Folks behind the bar steered me in the right directions for food and drinks, both of which were home runs 
Loved the atmosphere- busy and loud to make it interesting but not overwhelming. Get there early because there is (apparently) always a line out the door - no different for my visit!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shelley D.,Amazing food!  Everything we ordered was delicious!  The servers are very friendly and helpful if you can't decide what to get.  We wanted to order everything!!  The bartenders were awesome!  Definitely a must go eatery!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel A.,"Definitely worth a visit if you're in Toronto! The food was delicious, the service was amazing, and I LOVE LOVE LOVED the decor/vibes here. Our server was wonderful and since we were from out of town, we decided to order the fan favorites according to our server. They were: Pad Thai, Khao Soi and the Green Curry. All of them were delicious! We also ordered the Grabong which was surprisingly my favorite dish (menu description - freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters lightly coated in red curry paste batter, deep-fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with peanuts) because the flavors and texture were wonderful!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aya E.,"Ordered:
Thai Chicken Wings - 1/2lb (~CAD$10): 4 fried chicken wings topped with crispy shallots, magrud lime leaves, and crispy chillies with a sweet tamarind sauce
Pad See Ew with Chicken (~CAD$20): stir-fried hand-cut rice noodles with sweet soy sauce, Chinese broccoli, and egg
Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Beef (~CAD$20): red-flame stir-fried rice noodles in a house-made tamarind-palm sugar sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, long leaf coriander, shredded cabbage, fresh lime, and house-roasted peanuts; mild spice
Thai Iced Tea (~CAD$20)
Aya's take:
When I tell you we (party of 2) waited a whole hour to eat here - I am not joking. For a Sunday evening, it was insanely busy and unfortunately you had to go in, put your name down, and then wait around to receive a text. Despite that, I'm here to tell you it was worth it! After an hour of staring at and salivating over the menu waiting for a table, we knew what to order right away. The Thai Chicken Wings were sticky, crispy, and aromatic. What a great way to start the meal. Both noodle dishes were phenomenal. The Pad See Ew was smokey, sweet, and fresh. The Pad Thai was loaded with beef and had an unbelievable depth of flavors. There was a tad too many beansprouts but overall, that wasn't too distracting. The Thai Iced Tea was sweet, creamy, and balanced out the spices and richness of the dishes. I completely understand the hype around Pai and why it was so busy on a Sunday night. My only complaint would be the wait time, but the food is well worth a visit!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Larry L.,"We decided to get dinner at PAI Northern Thai Kitchen on a Tuesday after work.  We arrived around 5:15 PM and was at first told that there would be a 30-minute wait for a table.  
As we were adding our name to the wait list, a waitress informed the hostess that there was a cancellation, and a table was now available and somehow were immediately seated.  I'm not sure how that happened, but it worked out well.
On entering the restaurant, we noticed that although it was very busy and somewhat nosily, the dining area was well decorated had a good ambiance.  After being seated, we were informed that we had a 90-minute time limit, which was fine as we did not plan on lingering after eating.
We ordered the following:
1X Northern Thai Platter
1 X Khao Soi with Beef
1 X Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Chicken
The Northern Thai Platter was well prepared and well presented and was a good way to sample several of the appetizers that are offered.  The Pad Thai was authentic, but a bit ordinary compared to the other dishes.  The Khao Soi was the standout dish and had a very silky, yet thick and satisfying broth with a good server of noodles.
Overall, the service was very good (especially since we did not have to wait to be seated), the food was delicious, authentic, well presented and well prepared with fresh ingredients.  I would definitely return again and order the Khao Soi.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alekhya M.,"This has got to be our best Thai experience in Canada. It compares to some really great Thai we've eaten in Philly (Chabba) and in Amsterdam. It's a busy place but we got our table in half hour. They put you on wait-list and text you when your table is ready. In the meantime, you can check out the PAI story and other cool things on the wall.
The waitress did mention that none of the items are spicy but brought us their hot oil which is very flavorful. We had their signature green curry which was definitely the highlight. Do dig in to the coconut and scrape the tender coconut and eat it too! We also got their noodles which was great. The amount of protein and in general their quantity is pretty generous. I would think they're decently priced, not too bad for the area especially because the quantity is so good. Taste totally hits the spot.
Service is pretty great too. We were seated next to the toilets at first and asked to be moved and they obliged immediately even though they're really busy.
Decor is so bright and beautiful with all the hanging lanterns. You don't feel like you're in a dingy basement. It's pretty vibrant and loud.
We are going to keep coming back when we have Thai cravings.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chad J.,"Visiting Toronto and was told this place is one of the best Thai restaurants in North America.  Well it's it good, but maybe not that good.  Great location, nice atmosphere and pretty good service.  Make sure you arrive early or be prepared to wait.  We arrived at 5 md had no problem but by the time we left a line was out the door.  Best dish we hadn't the table were the wings!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joe W.,"Funky & Delicious! Great food and atmosphere, with lots of Thai options that include different tastes, textures and spice levels. I would highly recommend it if you are going out with a group, or wanting to impress someone with a delicious dinner. Not the place to go for a quiet dinner, but there are enough private areas. Be forewarned, the wait times can be quite long as it's so popular.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lucia L.,"It's Pai - you know it's gonna be good! My all time favourite Thai place in Toronto. I will always keep coming back. The only reason I don't come back as often as I'd like is that it's hard to get reservations and it's really popular so I don't want to wait in line most of the time. Make sure to come early if you're doing walk in. 
My top two favourites are the beef salad (so flavourful) and the pad Thai (so delicious). The pad thai is seasoned so well, I can't eat any other pad thai in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Madison S.,The soup was so good we shared everything and I forgot to take a picture before we got the food. It's my first time here but this place is a must go to,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Monica L.,"My friend recommended this place and the hotel staff of the hotel I stayed at all gushed about how ""life changing"" this place was. They weren't wrong. The unique decor transports you to another world upon entering the restaurant, but make sure you come early to wait for a table--they're always packed! You only get 90 minutes to eat your dinner because of how crowded they are.
Pad see ewe: Noodles are cooked perfectly al dente and there's a very healthy mouthful of veggies with every bite. Not as much ""smokiness"" as I'm used to from other Thai places, but it definitely holds it's own.
Khao soi: This was a favorite at our table. What's not to love? Deliciously coconutty broth to impart a mellow savoriness that lingers on the tongue. Quite a dish for the taste buds.
Tom yum soup: Yet another dish that makes your taste buds sing. Very rich, vibrant flavor to the point of almost too savory (LOTS of fish sauce) but I love that it's more flavor and less ""sour"" as most inauthentic tom yums tend to be made.
Papaya salad: lots of tiny shrimp and freshness. I really liked the shrimp chips (peppery!) and pork rinds that come with this dish. Mix those and the noodles with the salad and you've got yourself a textural treasure. 
Pad thai: I saved the best for last--my personal favorite of the bunch. The noodles are again, made perfectly and the sauce is slightly sweet without being overly so. They probably put a healthy amount of crack in there as well because I kept going back for more. Amazing must-have!
Overall, this is a place every tourist and local alike must experience if they are ever in the area. It's worth the wait!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Heidi M.,"Sadly we did not get a chance to dine-in, due to a 1.5 hour wait, but we did order takeout.  There's a designated waiting area for takeout orders, which made the 30 minute wait acceptable.  We were told by locals to try the Khao Soi, which we had never tried or heard of before.  We were not led astray, because that was the BEST Thai dish I've tasted.  I wish we could have experienced it at the restaurant itself, but it was still out of this world!  I'm hoping the next time we're in Toronto, we'll get a chance to. The 4-stars is for not being able to review the service/dine-in experience, otherwise a 5-star.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nadine M.,"I've heard great things about Pai so I've been wanting to go. We had to wait for a while because it was a weekend but IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. We loved everything we ordered and they were well-priced given the serving. I still can't stop thinking about the papaya salad and pork skewer--definitely order that when you go!
If you go with friends, order (almost) everything on the menu and share so you can have a taste of every dish. I will definitely go back and won't stop raving about this restaurant!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sanya G.,"A must visit place but try to go for lunch or there is a long wait for approximately 30-50 minutes.
The food is just delicious, got to give this a try. 
The service is great and super quick as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Akhil G.,"Rubbish, irresponsible restaurant. Ordered two dishes with protein as chicken. One dish had chicken and was way lesser in quantity. The khao soi was given with beef instead of chicken. And was way more in quantity. It looked like they were trying to get rid of some old stuff and just dumped a ton of it. These guys can't even take basic directions and shows how lightly they take customers' preferences",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Audrey T.,"Yum! Stopped by for some Thai food and was not disappointed! Definitely make a reservation because there was a huge line during lunch time. 
Got the Thai chicken wings as an appetizer. Three fried chicken wings topped with crispy shallots, lemongrass, and crispy chillies with a sweet tamarind sauce ($6). Definitely nice and crispy. 
For the main, I got the shrimp green curry ($19.50) which came with jasmine rice. Green curry with bamboo shoots, makrut lime leaves, basil leaves, and coconut milk. Topped with Thai basil and red pepper. Loved the presentation - the curry came in the coconut and also in a bowl - there was so much food! 
My friend got the Tom yum soup and it was also served with rice. It was quite big so she got half packed to go!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole A.,"This is the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to outside of Thailand! It's super authentic and yummy! Highly recommend! There's two different locations, one in downtown core and one midtown but they are both busy so honestly does not matter which one you go to. It is faster if you plan in advance and make a reso or are willing to sit at the bar but otherwise it's generally a 30 to 45 minute wait. It's interesting because you go in and initially it looks like a small place but it actually opens up  to multiple rooms so its actually a large spot. It's decor reminds me of Thailand too! 
I would recommend the khao soi which is a soup based dish that is rich in flavour. You can choose your protein - chicken, beef or tofu and it comes with egg noodles and condiments on the side to make it as spicy as you wish. The crispy and soft egg noodles with the coconut mild flavoured spicy sauce is just ""chefs kiss"" . There was also lots of beef added to mine which was fresh and yum. 
Had the coconut sorbet for dessert which was lots of coconut ice cream in a legitimate coconut haha so you could also scrape the sides and eat some fresh coconut at the end. Great dessert to share - kinda impossible to finish on your own haha",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mellisa Jule N.,"Went to the downtown location of Pai for the first time! The door was on the left of the exit door which was kind of weird but cool. At first we were pretty confused on how to enter, until a delivery driver pointed it out! We reserved a table a month in advance since that was the only slot available at the time. 
We dined in on Sunday 28th, 2022. As we walked in, it became quite clear that this was a very popular spot! It was quite packed, as expected for a Sunday evening.
We followed the waiter to a very dark and small seating area. We requested to be seated elsewhere but were told with a very unremorseful tone that there are no other tables available. However, there was a table that remained empty the entire time we were at the restaurant. To add, the service from the waiters were pretty slow. We had to call the server just to order and call them to get any refills of water and to get the bill. None of them approached the table to ask how the meal was going or how things were going, but this was not the same for other tables, maybe because we were a young couple they thought it was okay to not pay as much attention to us! 
Despite the depressing environment and service, we thought the food was pretty decent! We got three starters to try: the skewers (moo ping), the garlic shrimp and the tom yom soup. The garlic shrimp was our favorite and the tom yom soup was our least liked one. The garlic shrimp was so tasty and cooked to perfection and the tom yom soup was too oily and a bit spicy. Skewers were chewy but pretty good!
For our main dish we chose the pad thai and the chicken Gaeng Panang curry. Both were really good! 
Overall, we would rate our experience 6.5-7/10.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cindy M.,"Pros: large waiting area
Cons: waiting for mediocre food
Came here for a late lunch (3pm on a Saturday) and the place was packed! For a table of 2, I had to wait for 30 minutes. They have a big waiting area with seats and a standing table so you don't need to wait in the cold.
I ordered the papaya salad, (6) chicken wings, and khao soi. Chicken wings and noodle soup came out warm, but on the cold side warm. Chicken wings had a bitter after taste. I was expecting the khao soi to be bigger from pictures and price point. The $19 noodle soup didn't have a generous portion. Papaya salad was pretty good, but the dried shrimp was a bit tough to eat. I would recommend shredding it and combining it to the dish.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Darby C.,"Whenever I spend a night out in downtown Toronto we always want to eat Thai food. This city has some of the best restaurants. We dropped by here around 6pm and there was a waiting list. You can request to be seated at the bar if you like the bar vibe.
As you walk through the restaurant you will smell the aromatic curries, pad thai, noodle dishes,  fried squash fritters, spring rolls, etc. The Northern Thai platter looked so yummy. I will definitely order that next time.
We ordered the Khao Soi and Gaeng Massaman. Khao Soi is fresh egg noodles in a golden coconut milk curry. It was just a bit too salty for my liking but I really enjoyed the curry broth. The protein  of choice was beef brisket. There's also crispy deep fried noodles served on top kind of like garlic bread with pasta. 4/5
Gaeng massaman is a peanut tamarind curry also with choice of protein or tofu veggie. The curry had a little sweet kick to it. The rice was wrapped in banana leave and served on the side.  The serving of rice should be bigger as most of us like to pour some curry on top of the rice. Otherwise the dish was pleasing for the palate . 4/5
Service was exceptional we didnt have to wait for a table as we were given a seat at the bar. The bartender and servers were all friendly and attentive. They asked me if I needed help with the menu.  He was able to explain some of the dishes to me on the menu. Menu are scanned by phone using QR codes. 
Next time I will study the menu and pick out my next dish I want to try. There are so many options to choose. If you want to take a trip to street food in Northern Thailand give this place a try you won't regret it.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J Q.,"One of the best Thai spots in Toronto! Great ambiance, terrific service. Would recommend to anyone!!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike H.,"We went here with high expectations we ordered the Khao Soi and Pad Thai, the Khao Soi was great but the Pad Thai was not anything special, and they did not take cash., still willing to give it another try",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vera K.,"It was our first time at Pai. I was interested in visiting this restaurant as I follow them on Instagram and I really appreciate their history and the chef Nuit's passion for cooking.
We went on a Saturday for lunch and we didn't have a reservation. When we arrived there, the receptionist told us it would take two minutes to get a table ready for us. And it took less than that.
The receptionist took us to our table and I really liked the place. It was like we were walking through a street in Thailand. The tables are not so close one from another, so you have enough space to walk enjoying the decoration, without bumping in others chairs. I really liked the washroom area. It was super clean and there were a lot of private washrooms  with a toilet and a sink in each one of them. You could enter, close the door and take your time without others pressing you to hurry up.
We ordered Chef Nuit Pad Thai and the food was delicious.  It was a perfect balance of flavors, the sweetness, the spiciness and the coriander flavor. By the end of the meal we were planning our next visit.
I'd recommend it as a nice place to go with friends, family, or a partner.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Theresa A.,"Ordered the chicken khao soi and wow - it was as delicious as I've read about it. The presentation was amazing, coming with sides of chili, limes and pickles. I only wish I could eat this noodle dish more frequently. Highly recommend for anyone, especially if you haven't had northern Thai food before. Place was pretty crowded so recommend making a reservation. Service was super friendly and on top of everything.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela G.,Maybe I am spoiled by great Thai place in the Chicago area but this place was not bad for middle of Wyoming Thai.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arvid Y.,"***4.5 Stars***
Chef Nuit does it again. I've been to the old SukhoThai restaurants, but this was my first time trying out Pai.
Granted I got take-out, but the food was still good. Ordered the Thai wings, Chicken Pad Thai, Chicken Green Curry, Spring Rolls and a Shrimp Tom Yum.
The online ordering process was easy and food was prepared in a timely manner. It is on the pricier side, for Thai food, but quality is definitely up there. 
I would return for a dine-in experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shuang W.,"PAI IS MY FAV RESTAURANT IN TORONTO. thats my statement. They deserve all the fame and high ratings in my opinion :)
most recently visit of mine was a weekend lunch, we ordered pad gra prow, pad thai, grapong (fried squash fritter) , GAENG HUNGLAY ( curry with braised oxtail) and ofc some thai tea.
1. pad gra prow is my go to, you cant believe how much money I spent on this on delivery platform. the best is to add crispy pork to it, it is soooooo good. best i have ever had.
2. the fritter is A LOT, it might get greasy after a while but when you have a big group, it is such a good snack to share when you are waiting for main dishes
another thing which i always order, its their papaya salad with dried shrimp. OH MY GOD, please try it. the fish sauce, the crackers, the pork rinds and the shrimp, with the papaya, its like a huge party on your tongue. 
they have so many good dishes, its hard to order something bad here. only tip i have to give here is, please go there early for dinner for lunch whatever, they are SOOOOOO busy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kemi M.,"I love Thailand and Thai food! This place is incredible for the good vibes and great food. I felt like I was back in Thailand because of the ambiance. I got the prettiest mocktail! For starters we got the grabong. It was a dish i've never had but was advised it was a best seller. I would definitely get it to start again. The crispness and sweet sauce really made the dish.
I got the Shrimp Pad Thai as my main and loved it. I got it Thai spicy and boy was it spicy! Authentic and very flavorful. I will definitely be back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Errin S.,"Wow, what a find! Make sure you plan your reservations a few days before, because you do not want to miss this one. We ended up with a last minute reservation for a 4pm dinner, and I'm so glad we took it! 
I'm an avid lover of all things ""Thai-food"" and this place did not disappoint!
From the perfectly cooked noodles, to the steamed rice delivered wrapped in a banana leaf, to the green curry served hot in a fresh coconut, we were thrilled with every aspect of our meal. 
I also recommend the drinks... The Thai mojito was a fun twist on the classic. 
The tom yum soup was a delicious starter and prepped us for the spice level of the dishes to come... Yes, it's spicy (maybe even VERY spicy), but I wouldn't have it any other way.  
Definitely recommend and will return next time I'm in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria F.,"Service was great - attentive and quick. The wait was long - nearly an hour for 2 people on a weeknight. The mango slaw and sai ua were excellent, but neither the khao soi nor the pad Thai were anything to write home about.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dan K.,"An easy 4.5 stars. 
One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to outside of Thailand.
We sampled the Green Curry, Panang Curry, Pad Thai, Moo Ping, Chicken Wings and Tom Yum soup. 
I'm not going to go through a play by play. Everything was fantastic and I would put your fate in their hands. Order anything on the menu. You won't be disappointed.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Avi R.,"Pai is a well known thai place in Toronto! Highly recommend to make reservations. If not expect to wait for a long time to be seated.
Covid vaccine proof is required to dine in! Have your ID and vaccine copy handy (digital or card).
We made a reservation and got seated right away. Their menu specializes on northern thai food along with classic thai dishes. We started off with drinks which i highly recommend, very refreshing. 
We got their fried rice, pork curry, chicken stir fry. The food came in quick and was delicious. A bit pricey but seems to be the norm in Toronto. 
Highly recommend checking them out!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susan H.,Beautiful restaurant interior with soaring ceilings and south east Asian street decor. Food was very tasty and they had a variety of alcoholic drinks I will need to come back to try. Server was nice and provided good recommendations as the item I originally wanted to order was out of stock. I do recommend making a reservation in advance as it can get very busy in the evenings. Save room for dessert!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diana N.,"Make a reservation and enjoy the food. There's a reason why this place is always packed! 
I went with a few friends and sampled the Northern Thai Appetizer platter, shrimp chips, and had the pad gra prow. I wanted to try the Pad see ew and the coconut dessert but unfortunately both were sold out when I was here. 
I was honestly surprised that laab was on the menu, but it was great to see the authentic meals! I will be back for sure to try more dishes :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin Y.,We heard this is the best in Toronto.  We had a great time.  The food was very authentic and is also a very hip place.,4

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Avishek N.,"This restaurant exudes rustic charm, offering a captivating ambiance perfect for a memorable dining experience. The soothing music complements the inviting decor, making it an ideal setting for gatherings with friends or family. The perpetual 30-minute wait for a table is a testament to its popularity. The menu showcases expertly crafted Thai dishes, each a flavorful delight using fresh, high-quality ingredients. The staff's efficient and friendly service adds to the overall appeal. Despite the wait, this culinary gem delivers an authentic Thai experience, making it a must-visit for those seeking exceptional cuisine and ambiance.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mary M.,"On my hunt to find the best Thai food in the GTA, I've finally had the chance to try Pai.
Now, I wasn't expecting it to be as large as it was, looks can be deceiving, you turn the corner inside and there's a full seating area which can be restaurant on its own. Reservations highly recommended as by around 5:30 it was filling up fairly quickly.
Once inside, there are lanterns hanging from the ceiling, wall art, seating included everything from high top, to bench's & tables.
The menu had a variety of options. The squash fritters were a tad bit hard, the garlic chicken was a bit overcooked to my liking, with each bite, I could taste the oil.
The Green curry was served in a coconut which was fascinating. They also provided a small bowl of extra curry.  This was very  tasty, rich of earthy flavours, served with rice in a leaf.
kaosoi, was also very flavourful.
Oh boy, when they say Thai hot, they aren't a kidding that will set anyone's mouth on fire.
Even though it was as busy as it was, our food arrived almost immediately, the server was attentive and we had everything we needed quickly.
Overall, I can see the hype! I will be back to try the Panang",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea L.,"Great food, popular place, always crowded but worth the wait. Great ambiance too! Good place to go for first dates or friend catch-ups",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ciara H.,"Definitely come here for great food, drinks, and a great social atmosphere. Prepare for 15-20 minute wait because it is very popular but the staff is super friendly and attentive. The ambiance is comfortable, fun photos, and sayings to keep you occupied during the wait or entertained because there's something to catch your attention on every turn. My friend and I enjoyed all the flavors our appetizers had to offer. Thank you for an enjoyable experience in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,MV D.,"Excellent food

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Robert G.,Food was well 'seasoned ' the cost was reasonable given its downtown. Authentic Thai (I worked in Bangkok for about  6 months) very busy,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Richard H.,"Those 3400 Yelpsters who gave 4.5 stars couldn't be more right as our dining experience after my using Open Table to book a reservation that same day only to discover when I arrived had made it for the wrong location. The place was packed with a separate queue waiting to score a seat. Fortunately the hostess handled my mistake and we were seated within 15 mins. I can best describe Pau Northern as a hip place for some amazing home cooked Thai food. The place is loud and vibrant with locals and tourists wanting to try some of their amazing dishes. We loved everything with the exception of the beef skewers as they were slightly on the dry side compared to the chicken skewers which were fantastic. Papaya salad was great but the two white noodles curled up on the side of this dish like when a cat curls up when taking a nap were mixed with salad which caused them to be too wet. The shrimp chips were used as a scoop to place the ingredients in which were then eaten in this manner. Both the Pad Thai with chicken and the Pad Gra Prow were super with a slight nod to the latter. And of course, one cannot leave without having the mango sticky rice. 5 solid stars and special thanks to our host and server who made our dining experience special.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelsey G.,"Ate here a couple years ago pre-pandemic on the recommendation of a friend- grabbed take out again recently and was transported back- PAI IS GOOD! The flavors are complex and they were super efficient and quick for takeout (even though I got quoted a much longer wait, it was ready in like 15 minutes at peak dinner time..) 
They have a LONG wait for dinner. I suggest you just grab takeout and enjoy at home.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mony K.,"An authentic experience for some hard to find thai dishes. 
Reservations recommended but walking also possible with a little wait. The venue is quite big so they can churn out new seatings fast. 
They have your typical Thai dishes but also some unique dishes that you won't find at other Thai restaurants. The Chiangmai beef noodle soup had an excellent broth but the beef was a little tough. The beef salad was reasonable. The pad krow pow was excellent and they also gave up some fresh peppers to adjust the spicyness to our desired level. Massaman curry hit it out of the park. Pandan cake was fluffy and not too sweet which is what I like. 
It took a little to get out entree but the waiter did apologize but we had our huge glasses of Sapporo to bud the time. Overall it's a low end 5* just making it pass the 4 mark.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ethan J.,"The Green Curry is my Thai go to dish for new places, and this one did not disappoint! Plus it came in a coconut! Nice touch. Servers and bar tenders were kind and interesting. Also very unique and cool atmosphere.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Saira S.,Excellent quality Thai dishes! The only reason I'll give it a 4/5 is because the popularity of the restaurant results in long wait times and slow service. My favorites are the pad thai and pad ga prow!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ravi A.,"Wowza - the most fantastic Thai food in a long long long time.  Took me back to the streets of Bangkok and Koh Samui.
The pork skewers were to die for. Tom yum hit the spot - can't wait to come back on a cold winter night and chug it!!  The pork and basil - woah!  Been hunting for this since my last Thai trip a few years back.  Found you and not only am I having some tonight but getting one more portion packed for tomorrow.  
Drinks are spot on.  Had the spicy p - ok had three.  Fantastic.
Service is so so good - super friendly people, very fast service.  
Ambiance is amazing - the space looks super welcoming while being super modern.  Crowd skews younger but that could have been because we went super late.  It's noisy without being loud.  Definitely a place to put on the regular rotation.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raquel R.,"Went on a Wednesday night,  Had to wait a few minutes for a table. Waited at the bar, and ordered some drinks. Bartender Zavier was friendly and attentive. We were sat down shortly after. Our waitress was a sweetheart. She was patient and went over the menu with us. She gave us great recommendations. Even though the place was lively and packed it felt intimate. This restaurant has such a great vibe, such a unique atmosphere. I felt like we stepped into another dimension. Nothing like the cold night it was in the city. Honestly we had a great time from the moment we stepped in till we walked out. The staff is welcoming. The food is delicious and full of flavor. We ordered the Pad Gra Prow. The egg was fried perfectly. The spice was Worth it. We loved our time here. This checks off all the boxes for a great time. From date night to drinks with friends to a cozy night out. Would recommend to everyone !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carolyn Q.,"A friend from the area recommended this place as a good Thai restaurant, and we really enjoyed it! We arrived around 5, thinking we beat the dinner rush (which we did), but still had to wait 15 minutes for a table. By the time we got our table, the line to put your name down was out the door and down the street, so this place is definitely a busy one! The waiter told us that by the time they open at 4 pm, there's already a line outside. 
I can definitely understand why people are willing to wait for this! They had your normal Thai favorites and a lot of additional options to pick from. We went with the Khai Soi with tofu and the Pad Gra Prow with shrimp, which were both very good. Personally if I were to go back and could only order one of the two, I would go with the Pad Gra Prow, but it is a really close race. The Pad Gra Prow's rice was cooked perfectly well, with the right amount of seasoning to go with the entire dish. They were very generous with their portions, which made up for their higher than expected prices. The Khai Soi was also very flavorful and creamy. It was the perfect flavor blend for a curry, with a good amount of noodles to go with every bite of soup. 
Overall, the meal was extremely good, but a little pricier than expected. I would highly recommend trying out this place!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nick E.,"Food and staff were great, the ambience was very cool. My kids loved it, made me a super hero for sure. Thank you",5

We were seated at a high table for 6 and since there was only 4 of us, we said we didnt mind if 2 additional ppl were seated at the table later, which dis happen. Its was busy and while I didnt particularly like the decor it wasnt horrible and there was a welcoming vibe by the staff.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yao W.,"PAI was highly recommended by numerous friends, and it did not disappoint! My friend and I arrived around 4:45pm to beat the crowd, and were seated within minutes. We tried their famous sweet milk tea, the green curry served in a coconut, the tender beef skewers, the pad thai, the rice served and wrapped in the leaf, as well as the coconut sherbet! My favourites were definitely the skewers and the green curry! The pad thai would have been perfect if only they cracked an egg in there haha (just my personal opinion!). Service was friendly and efficient. Would highly recommend!",5

little loud 
service excellent",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Martina W.,"Idk if it's a Canada thing, but on top of having amazing food, they have the best customer service. I am regrettably a very difficult customer due to my dietary restrictions (pescatarian, always get stuff removed, non-dairy, the list goes on...lol). They made me feel like nothing I asked for was too much, and they were happy to accommodate every need.
Now to the food... Hands down, the near pad Thai I have ever had. Thai food is one of my favorite types of food, and I live in LA. I have been to most, if not all, the best spots in town. Mind you, I have never been to Thailand. It tasted like nothing I have ever had before. The tofu and vegetables were cooked to perfection. Heat and temperature levels were perfect. Flavor was on point. It also had a barbecue taste to it that's hard to explain. Overall, amazing.
I also had the spring rolls. Those were amazing as well. Very basic but still one of the best spring fried rolls I have ever had, if not the best.
I also ordered the khao soi to go, for me to try later. This is one of my favorite Thai dishes (my other is pad Kee mao, which they didn't have). I was disappointed :(. The tofu was hard, and the food was barely Luke warm. Some of the vegetables were warm, and some were actually cold. The flavor was also lacking. I make khao sou at home and order it at restaurants all the time. It's always amazing and very flavorful. I was shocked that it wasn't good. One thing to note is that they brought out my order to eat there, and I told them I ordered it to go, but requested a bowl so I could try some before I leave. It took another ~10min to bring the food back, and I imagine that is why it tasted the way it did. Very disappointed, but was very satisfied with how they handled and remedied the situation.
I would overall recommend this place. The comments are all true. I see why this is the first restaurant that came up when I searched ""best restaurant in Toronto"" on Yelp. Well deserved and highly recommended!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,JJ S.,"I'm struggling to give 4 stars while this place used to be my favorite every time we visited Toronto over the years. Lately I feel the quality of the food has gone down a bit. For starter, lunch is noticeably not as good as dinner. I'm talking about back to back Pad Thai, one ordered during dinner the night before vs the next lunch. But in general it's still a solid place for Chiang mai/northern Thai cuisine. 
What we're ordered in the past:
Gang hunglae (oxtail) --delicious, the sauce is quite close to what I've had in Chiang mai. The oxtail was tender, sadly there wasn't enough meat compared to the soup
Pad Thai-- In general it's very flavorful, nice and dry with beautiful aroma. Plenty of shrimp. Again, lately the presentation and condiments seem a bit downgraded. Still one of the best dishes here
Khao Soy (beef/chicken) --we used to love khao soy here! It was a flavor closest to the original imo years back. Yesterday when we went back I must say it has tasted quite bland and watered down. Generous portion as always. 
Krabong -- solid app, herbs forward and we've always enjoyed this. Wishing they would add more veggies like fried lemongrass /herbs to add to the texture 
Sai oa (northern sausage) --mild flavored, beautiful presentation. I'd like it turned up a notch but I think it's catered to the gen pop well. 
Ambience 5/5 : a bit loud but great atmosphere
Service 4/5 : very nice people, slow service but they try their best. 
Still beat Thai restaurants in Midwest US any day!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joe S.,"Tasty, warm staff, but the heat is adjusted for ""falang"" meaning non-Thai so while the flavors are there, the heat is missing.  Highly recommended.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leia H.,"Had a long craving for Thai but just couldn't get a table for this one... booked nearly 1 month ahead only to secure a reservation at 5pm!! So ""better be good"" I thought :D
Turns out the food is quite satisfactory , with amazingly generous portion!! (We two have small stomaches though) would recommend:
Tom Yum Soup -absolutely THE best I've ever had, with this perfect balance of sweetness and sourness
Shrimp chips- cannot afford to miss the homemade  sauce
Other dishes are tasting just fine- the most applauded Pad Thai isn't quite our thing, tasting a bit distant from what we had when traveling to Thailand.  
Oh I need to mention the great service: We found Pad Thai to be slightly spicier than we had expected , and they made a new one outright, with generous beef topping! Would love to go another time - if we ever get a reservation again",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tab Y.,"We stopped by Pai on a Saturday around 3:45pm. They said it would be a forty-five minute to fifty minute wait, so we decided to explore the neighboring area while we waited. They asked for our name and phone number, and they texted us once they were ready to take us. 
At around 4:30pm, we received a text and then got back in line. Within a few minutes, they sat us down, said there was a 90 minute turn around and told us the menu was available via QR code. You can check out the menu online. 
They also informed us that they take debit or credit but no cash. Our server got to us pretty quickly and we ordered a few things:
Khao Soi with Braised Beef ($20) - tasted like a more liquified red curry. Noodles had a good texture, chewy but not over cooked. Loved the fried egg noodles. I think that was my favorite part. It might've been a bit more appetizing had it been more spicy or if it came with a side of rice. 
Chicken Pad Thai ($20) - a bit on the tangy side, but the ingredients and noodles tasted very fresh. We finished this entree, and I could definitely see myself ordering the Pad Thai for takeout. 
Odd Future IPA ($10) - it first came as a can, so the guy who brought it asked if my husband wanted a glass. The glass, however, didn't look very clean... so he decided not to use it.  It's light for an IPA and a little fruity. Pretty refreshing. 
Thai Iced Tea - I tried to order one in the evening, but the server said they ran out and recommended some other drinks. 
Total came out to be a little less than $70 with tip. All in all, I'd give this place a solid four. Cleanliness could be better, but the food is all around solid. Service is about a 4/5 as well. Definitely a place to stop by if you're in town!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nilu M.,"Best Pad Thai I've ever had!
My biggest struggle with Thai food is most dishes have fish sauce and its been a challenge finding restaurants that accommodate for different dietary restrictions.
Through some recommendations I finally got some pad thai for takeout and was pleasantly surprised. The dish was delicious and kept you wanting more. We also got the green curry which was also delicious and included plenty of tofu pieces to keep you full. 
Usually I find most places over do it on the veggies but it was well balanced here and you can see why they're always so busy!
The in restaurant experience is a vibe in its own, so looking forward to doing that the next time I'm in town.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel G.,"My first meal in Toronto at Pai's, Food is soooo delicious, setting the bar very high for my expectations of the meals I'll be having the next few days.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Damini G.,"Always my go to for Thai when in Toronto! 
Loved the service food and ambiance. Glad it's reopened'",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine T.,"Portions are small but flavors are good!
We ordered:Pad Gra Prow, Panang Curry, Squash Fritters, Beef Curry and a few other dishes.
I'd recommend coming early  to avoid the wait.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erik B.,"Been coming here for a a while and it's always been really good but a word of warning it's spicy and very good. I have done takeout mainly, as I like to sit beside my date, rather than across the table from them. Have sat up at the bar and had a margarita and the bartender was very good.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Meschac G.,"Pai was a bit of discovery and it felt like peeling off onions as we did not realize how big the place was at first. We hung out at the front bar while waiting to be called for our seats then we got to go all the way to the back to realize wait there's another bar :D Despite being a much larger restaurant than we thought, it felt very intimate and private. Service was quick and the server was nice The food was delicious. I enjoyed their Gaeng Massaman and my partner had Pad Thai with Tofu in both. The meals tasted quite good and that smoky flavor to the Pad Thai was on point. My only two complaints was that mine was a very small bowl and I wish it had more peanut flavor which I felt was not very present for a dish that's supposed to highlight peanut as the main ingredient. As far as drinks, I had a Tea Mac be warned it has milk I didn't realize so I broke my veganism for a moment. While I am not hardcore, I'd rather know from the menu because I would have not selected it. My partner had a lemony pepperminty drink that was fresh and enjoyable. Overall we liked our experience. We selected this place spontaneously as I know my partner loves Thai food and it'd be a good place to go on her birthday. We'd go back again for sure!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tea T.,"Meh... I don't get the hype around this place.. the food is oily and soulless, good to fill you up.. The place is loud
The Queen Mother Cafe, located few minutes away has been my 'go to' for the past 20 years, everything on their menu taste fresh and is definitely more authentic... Their Khao Soy Gai and Ping Gai are addictive,  same price range..",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,T. G.,"Hot spot in town! We had to go.. we landed from US and quickly ran over to put our name in around 6pm'ish on a Wednesday night. Within 45 min our table was ready! Service was excellent and the place was beyond packed! We ordered Thai iced teas both regular and 1 with vodka, yum. We tried papaya salad - it was spicy but good. We also ordered Shrimp Pad Thai and Chicken Pad See Ew (they don't offer beef? Maybe it's not traditional? No clue) - once my mouth was on fire from the delish papaya salad I flagged the waiter and begged him to please notify kitchen not to make the entrees spicy. He agreed and came back to let me know - all is ok!  Not only was it not ok, I had to send back my Pad Thai. Ugh. I hate doing that. Spicy incident aside I'd absolutely recommend this spot! It was close to the hotel and the wait was so worth it overall! The mango rice also looked delish, I'd absolutely want to try that next time!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara B.,"I've been a fan of Chef Nuit Regular for years (Sukho Thai is my fav), but somehow never made it to Pai. 
An old friend/chef offered to make us reservations and we were so glad he did, as we were seated at the best table in the place with a great view of the restaurant. Ambience was dim and lovely. Service was fantastic. 
We ordered: 
- Gai Satay (so tender!)
- Khao Soi
- Green Curry (served in a coconut)
- Pad Gra Prow
I don't think you could go wrong ordering any item on the menu. Each dish was phenomenal. So many layers of flavour. The absolute best Thai food in Toronto. Truly a gem and a must visit.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ed U.,"Great authentic Thai food. Friendly staff. Prices are commensurate with food quality. Being Michelin-star, this place is indeed highly recommended!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leang E.,I ordered take out from here and walked over to pick it up and man that line to wait and eat inside was real. I was so glad pick up was easy and quick. I got the Tom yum soup and chicken pad Thai and both were excellent. I finished them both. Prices were reasonable as well. I can see why the spot is so popular.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Crystal N.,"Great food! Always a pleasure to visit. I ordered their mango salad which was great and refreshing. 
I also ordered their khao soi (amazing as always). You can choose your own spiciness level and be warned it is quite potent! 
Tip: make resos ahead of time .. there is always a super long line up!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike D.,"An extremely cozy and delicious restaurant with friendly staff! all for a very reasonable price!
The wait may be long usually, but it's worth it. You can even make a reservation via email.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ariel H.,"DELISH. Will be back. Restaurant is bigger than it looks. We came on a Saturday for an early dinner (2 people) and were able to get seated right away. The portions were big, definitely recommend sharing family style. The flavors were rich and balanced. We went for the pad see ewe and was surprised at how much they were able to elevate this very common dish!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jun L.,"Pai is hands down my favorite Thai restaurant, and I couldn't recommend it enough. I have ordered from here numerous times since first trying it last winter (2022), and every time has been an absolute delight. The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and inviting, and the decor sets the perfect ambiance for an intimate evening out.
One of the main positives of this restaurant is the food - it is absolutely delicious and unlike any other Thai food I have tried. The flavors are unique and exciting, and it is evident that the chefs have a deep understanding of Thai cuisine. Whether you're in the mood for spicy noodles or a curry dish, the food at Pai is always a treat for the taste buds. The drink options are also diverse, and the cocktail menu is especially noteworthy. (although I personally recommend their beer) 
In addition to the food and drink options, the staff at Pai is wonderful. The waiters are friendly, professional, and attentive, and they always make sure that your dining experience is as pleasant as possible. They are knowledgeable about the menu and are happy to make recommendations based on your preferences.
One minor issue to keep in mind is that the wait can be longer than other restaurants, especially during peak hours. It is advisable to sign in or join the waitlist sooner rather than later to avoid any unnecessary delays. Additionally, it's important to note that the spicy level is beyond the normal ""hot sauce"" spicy. Even if you're usually good with spicy food, I recommend starting with the low - middle level of spice recommendations as the highest level can be very intense.
In conclusion, Pai is a must-visit Thai restaurant for anyone who loves great food, a cozy atmosphere, and wonderful service. From the diverse drink options to the excellent food choices and the friendly and professional staff, the experience at Pai is simply outstanding. I would highly recommend giving it a try and savoring every bite of their authentic and delicious Thai cuisine.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vatsal S.,"Super authentic and amazing ambiance. I felt transported to a hip restaurant in Thailand right away and we were seated towards the back which was amazing as we saw the entire place which is huge and colorful and brimming with life
Service was good too, normal and busy. 
We got the pad thai and khao soi. Pad Thai was a huge hit. Definite 5/5 especially when getting it Thai spicy. The khao soi could be a bit better with thicker gravy but flavors were amazing so 4/5 for that. 
Mango sticky rice was amazing too. Another 5/5!
Thai ice tea was very good too. Also a 5/5!
Overall super amazing especially with the ambiance.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danielle B.,"This place is home to the best Thai curry I've
ever had! (And I've had a lot lol)
I went out to their restaurant for the first time
and was surprised by how beautiful and cozy
the interior was. Laterns decorated the ceilings,
there were 3 separate rooms for seating and of
course, a great selection of dishes.
I had the Mussaman curry which I've had delivered before but having it in house takes it to another level! I also really appreciated the authentic wrapping of the rice, it was a nice touch.
I can't say enough great things about their food
you seriously just have to try it out for yourself.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Urvie P.,"Probably some of the most flavorful Thai food I've ever had. And Thai one of my favorite cuisines. Ordered tom yum ( not pictured 5/5), a chicken khaki soi and a tofu Khoi soi ordered, panang curry, pad Thai and chefs special stir fry! The dishes were unique and very vegetarian vegan and gluten free friendly! Their chilli oil also consisted of flavors that balance the heat but still maintained the kick which made it addicting! The reviews are NOT deceiving as some places can be in big citY restaurants! Def going back when I'm in Toronto again in a Couple weeks. A local mentioned ""if you don't like the food, there's something wrong with you"" and I second that!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rui M.,"Ordered a lot of take out from here during the pandemic and it was always good. The portions are solid and the flavor is amazing. I would normally get the green curry or khao soi with tofu and veggies. The green curry is good, but I would recommend trying the khao soi with your choice of protein. The egg noodles are crispy and if you let them soak in the coconut curry for a bit it packs that extra flavor. The green curry is also great and I usually mix it with my rice to soak in the curry flavor. Everything always tastes fresh and the smell always gets me. 
The pricing here is quite reasonable for downtown Toronto and for anyone that is looking to try some delicious Thai food, Pai is a great choice. Be warned the taste is amazing, but the smells can also be quite strong so if you let empty containers linger it will stick to your clothing.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M R.,"Brought colleagues here.  No matter the heat, taste comes through.  PAI delivers with every single dish.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Uyen N.,"Delicious Thai food! The green curry in coconut is very flavorful; it's a little spicy. The garlic tofu is really good as well. The tofu was marinated before deep frying, which is nice. Reservation is sold out pretty fast and wait time can get quite long, so try to get here when they open if you can.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa L.,Always busy amazing restaurant. Do not come starving as you'll likely need to wait but so worth it! Anything you order will be delicious. The northern platter is a great dish to share. My favourite and always have to order is the pad see ew. You really don't need my review for Pai. The line ups speak for itself! Go try it!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Levi W.,"Unbelievably delicious, absolutely would recommend to anyone.
FOOD:  Took my family here and we all loved the variety of foods. Our favorites were the green curry and pad thai. Incredibly delicious food and was very authentic. Also got a few drinks that were quite delicious--try their spiked thai tea, it's hard not to gulp down glass after glass!
PRICE: The food quality and service to price was fantastic. It's reasonably priced, and the cuisines you get are well worth its price--and beyond.
VIBES: From the moment you step in you feel transported to Thailand. The vibes and decor of the restaurant were so on-point, and was decorated with homages to the owners' trip/roots. There's also a cute photo album of their story together!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thomas M.,"Definitely worth the hype.  Make a reservation or there will be a wait. We ended up doing take out and took a minute as well, but well worth it.
We got the pad Thai which was amazing, well spiced, and ample for 2 people.
I didn't realize there was oyster sauce in it, so if you have an allergy beware. Otherwise, definitely add to your food stop while in town. 
Interior is amazing, so I suggest a dine in.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chanel C.,"Wonderful atmosphere, excellent food, friendly staff. If you looking for gluten free options, amazing availability",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David G.,"We waited at the bar for a table to be available. Usually a good sign if you need to wait for a table midweek. The bar here seemed, from our limited experience with bars in Toronto, to be typical for the area with beer and spirits. We love whiskey, so one of our goals with our first visit to Toronto was to explore Canadian whiskeys. The bartenders listened to what we like and what we wanted to learn before offering Alberta Premium Cask Strength whiskey. Great choice and a great value at this location as it was priced very reasonably. They were in a lull at the time so we spent some time discussing the offered whiskey and others. The bar starts a tab that will transfer to your table. Plus, they share all tips so you don't have to close out the bar tab to make sure the bartenders get their share.
Once seated, we asked for advice from our server. They suggested many things based on our request for items with lots of flavor. We really like Thai cuisine, but sometimes the flavors are a bit too subtle for us. We ordered khao soi with shrimp and panang curries. We also love lots of veg in our food, so I asked for the vegetarian panang, but replace the tofu with shrimp. Since I really wanted the shimeji mushrooms, I guess I could have also asked for the shrimp panang and add mushroom, but I wanted to get variety as well. I got a ton of mushrooms, a few shrimp, and some onion and red pepper strips. More variety would be nice, but the dish was great.
Since we were new to this place, we asked for the khao soi to be mild but to bring out the spice tray. The spice tray was tiny. The chili oil was about a teaspoon and not very hot, but tasted good. The tray also included one lime wedge, and something like a seasoned, perhaps fermented, bok choy or other greens. The greens were delicious, but it wasn't even half a bite so adding it to a large khao soi or even a small panang was going to do nothing. In the end, we just requested more lime and added as much of the chili oil as could scrape out of the tray into our dishes. We each loved both dishes, but had chosen the right dish for ourselves.
The atmosphere is cozy and somewhat eclectic. Certainly fun. The servers were all wonderful and attentive without being intrusive. If we go back we will ask for more lime up front, more chili oil and/or chili powder up front. Otherwise, the rest, and most important parts of the experience, were great. We highly recommend PAI... especially if you have to wait at the bar for a table.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Huong L.,"I honestly have to say that I wasn't too impressed with this place. Maybe my expectations was too high since the review was good and a couple of my family members really enjoyed this place. We managed to come around opening time and got seated right away.
Our waiter was a little snobbish in my opinion, he kinda just told us what to do and told us what to offer. Even when we got the check, I tried to wave him down to tell him he gave us the wrong check and he basically didn't even let me finish and cut me off. 
Foodwise, it wasn't the typical Thai food that you usually would get and it was good, pricy though in my opinion.
Shrimp salad platter---- not sure what this was called but it was a dish filled with various fillings and you make a small wrap from the betel leaves. It was good, very enjoyable and tasty and I love that they made an example of what it would look like so we know what to do 
Khao soi --- this is apparently very popular and it was delicious. I love the curry flavor. I do wish they gave us more noodles, there wasn't that much in it. We ended up having most of our soup left over but no noodles. The tofu (protein choice we opt for) was nothing really spectacular. They just cut up some soft tofu and put it in.
Those 2 dishes cost us close to $50 and we that was a light meal. Overall, it was ok.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thanu J.,"Delicious. The best Thai food in Toronto, and the closest I've gotten to Thailand authentic food
It's gotten really busy but still worth it if you want real Thai

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lina D.,"It's restaurants like these that make me really appreciate the variety of amazing food we have here in Toronto. I say this every time when I travel away from Canada. If you want the best Thai food in the city, this hits the spot for me. They get it every time and have a variety of vegan options. My favourite dishes are the curries and pad thai dishes. It's a classic but it hits me every single time. 
We were seated right away when we walked in at 4:30pm on a Friday evening right before the Justin Bieber concert. It was a very fine choice for an evening of adventure, fun and Bieber fever! Surprisingly, we finished almost everything and did not have a poor experience of any sort. Best tip for future customers: arrive early to avoid long queues and get seated right away!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew L.,"An institution of the Toronto food scene, I haven't been back in a while. The food is good, some dishes better than others. The homeruns were definitely the fried squash, pad thai and khao soi. It's the best when eating with a large group, so you can have a bit of everything. Not to mention, the thai iced tea is a perfect pairing to soothe that burning tongue. Overall, the food was good - but definitely at a higher price point!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dexter G.,"We left Halton Region to celebrate a birthday with party of 6 to Pai downtown location on Duncan street. 
After the usual long wait time our server escorted us to our table and proceeded to tell us (and lecture us) that there is a mandatory 20% gratuity charge. The rationale was it's more work and standard practice.
The said 'manager' (I think her name is Sharon...) was quite adamant.
We left and went to the Keg in Mississauga where we had an amazing event and experience. We will no longer be dining at Pai. We will not be recommending Pai either. 
Many better establishments that put the customer 1st.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer M.,"What a fun find! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and even better food. Bartender helped with some fun drinks while we waited for our table on a busy Saturday evening. Went with the recommended Khao Soi and can't wait to return to try another dish!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Louise F.,"Before visiting, I saw Pai referenced everywhere so I jnew that we had to go. Given that it was saturday night I was a bit worried about the wait but it worked out that we had to wait on a friend until later at night anyway. It was, in fact busy, but we got on the list at 7:40 and were told the wait would be 1-1:30h. And they have a takeout counter too which would be so much faster! Our's friend's eta was about 9:20 which worked out perfected because that's about when I got texted. In the time spent waiting we had a shopped around eaton centre, had a great haul, and were able to make it back slightly over the 10 min callback wait time but had to issues getting seated once there. I got the khao soi since this place is northern thai, and my friends got the pad thai and kanom jin nham ngeaw. We also got the grabong which although listed under appetizers, I'd be happy to eat as a meal. I actually think that may have been my favorite. But what can I say, everything was great!",5

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Spence W.,"You would never find this, if it wasn't so well recommended.  
Lining up down the stairs, I thought we would be waiting forever.  But once we made it down, they took us in right away and proceeded to take us through this awesome grey bricked underground that opened up into what became a huge restaurant.  
The vibe is cool, from the atmosphere to the music to the great staff.  Never mind the incredible northern Thai cuisine.  Thai food like this doesn't appear often.  Don't miss out.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John D.,"For all you west side kids, Pai has a location in Etobicoke delivering through apps. 
Location: Pai Etobicoke
Delivery: UberEats
I had to write my review before my words are slowly fleeting away..
Ordered Khao Soi, coconut curry egg noodle, one tofu/veggie and one beef. 
Beef Khao Soi. There are 5-6 large chunks of beef. 
Tofu/Veggie Khao Soi. Broccoli and cauliflower were overcooked and broke upon touch. 
Despite the overcooked vegetables, the coconut curry was so rich, creamy, and flavourful. The egg noodle was a smaller portion than expected; the broth to noodle ratio was really skewed in the broth's favour. 
I really appreciated the following: 
Lime/green onions were packed into a small Dixie cup container. 
Fried noodles were plentiful, a whole sandwich bag full. 
Egg noodles were perfectly cooked and packed into a small round container. 
Would 100% reorder with a slight hope for non-overcooked broccoli and cauliflower. 
I hope the Pai Etobicoke location allows dine in once we return to a semi normalcy in the not so distant future.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Irene C.,"We try this place based on yelp's review.  We were able to seat down in 15 minutes.  However the food took longer than more 30 minutes  to be ready.  We see other people order ready before ours.  Beef was very dry and the  portion are small on both dishes.  Also, the banana leaf rice only partially soft and part of the rice was burnt. We went to Wendy's after. The service is ok. But I won't recommended.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Margaret B.,"Absolute heavenly perfection, I'll never find Thai food as good, ever. Unless I go to Thailand, I guess! Tables are limited to 90 minutes so they can accept walk-ins, but it's no problem whatsoever and we didn't feel rushed at all.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ruoyu Catherine Q.,Probably the best Thai food in Toronto. Love the Tom yum soup! The platter was amazing - everything in the platter was good. The ambiance was nice with live music playing.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle L.,"Came in on a weekend after normal lunch hours and there was still a wait (just 20 minutes). We were seated and told that we had limited seating time, which I wasn't surprised about since this place was popping! It took a very long time for our food to arrive after we ordered (more than 40 minutes), but when we received our noodles dishes they were both very delicious and generously portioned. I had tried their second Toronto location a couple of years back and enjoyed this location much better in terms of tasting. They also have a not-so-secret room in the back right of the restaurants which opens to a whole other bright dining area which I thought was pretty neat. I can't wait to come back here when I visit Toronto again! Would be 5 stars if not for the long wait.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andy L.,"I had to come visit this place as everyone who has been to Toronto had recommended this Thai restaurant as it is one of the best. We had got a table for two and the wait was about an hour, but was totally worth it! I have to say that the service was exceptional to begin with.
Additionally, we had ordered the Khao Soi and Green Curry as our entries. The Khao Soi was phenomenal as the soup had a ton of flavor and paired well with the noodles. The Green Curry was good as well, but could have been a little bit thicker and would have been better with chicken. Aside from that, the Thai Iced Tea was also a good drink to go with our meal! The Mango Sticky Rice could have been a little sweeter with the coconut milk and mango, but was still a delicious dessert to end our meal. I will likely check out this place again if I come back to Toronto!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Euan S.,Superb. Great food and great service. Be advised debit/credit only no cash. Always a great choice.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hanyu T.,"Went for a quick workday lunch with colleagues on Wednesday. We came there around 12:16 pm - only 16min after opening and it's already 85% full. The atmosphere is relaxed and somewhat quirky- a nice little break amid work. We were seated immediately in the (probably) inner most room (a bar room right at the entrance and another one between ours and the bar room)
The menu can be viewed online after scanning a QR code. My colleague has less good phone signal so she had some trouble with it. The menu has a wide selection BUT a lot are only available after 4pm. They don't have a separated lunch section so we had to look 1 by 1 and manually filter dishes that are not available - which is a small inconvenience but caused some frustrations.
Food we ordered: 
Thai Chicken Wings - very tasty and would highly recommend. The outside is crispy but not too greasy and the insight is tender and juicy. The flavor is sweet & savory with a tiny hint of spice. 
Khao Soi with tofu - good but too thick and creamy for personal taste. 
Pad See Ew with shrimp - tasty and nice portion size. Will suit most people's taste buds if don't know what to order
Overall pretty good food. Would go again and try different entries. Will definitely order Thai Chicken Wings tho",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mandy A.,"Awesome dinner from PAI. We ordered our dinner and opted for pickup as dine in is not available due to COVID-19 and delivery was not an option. We ordered and started from our place which was around 40 mins. By the time we reached, the food was ready to be picked up. The pickup process was smooth. You just enter the building and all orders were kept on a table waiting to be picked up. We went in, shared our order details and our packet was handed over to us quickly.  
We ordered Green curry, Pad Thai and Pad Gra Prow. Green curry is our favorite now as it is one of the best Green Curry we had. Probably the best in Toronto. Pad Thai was also too good with good amount of chicken, tofu and eggs mixed. The taste was really amazing. There were crushed peanut provided separately which added in the taste. Gra Pro was also good and tasted well, but it was a bit too oily for us. Otherwise it would have been another hit for sure.  
The portion seemed to be a bit on the lesser side based on the cost of the dishes. Before all the offices in downtown closed down, we had PAI dishes frequently for much lesser price and more quantity. But now it seemed to be less for more prices. This is the reason for 1 less star in the reviews. Otherwise PAI is definitely an authentic Thai place in Toronto and definitely worth trying.  
Definitely recommended. Enjoy your Thai.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vanessa S.,"Went to have Thai food on a cold day in Toronto right when I walked into the place I loved it and knew it was going to be good, went with a coworker who tried Thai for the first time and absolutely loved it",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Minji S.,"NOTE: I would rate this place 4.5 stars
I've been here before but this is my first time leaving a review. Everyone says PAI as the place to go for their Thai food fix and I agree. This restaurant definitely lives up to the hype. Great service and great food again and again. 
A thing to note is that this place is always packed- I don't think I've ever went here without waiting at least 20 minutes. As well, this time, my sister and I got the bar area where the stools were wobbly. Furthermore, they take a while to cook your food. 
We got:
Pad Thai with Shrimp 5/5
-Amazing! The noodles are not too soft, which I love. Good flavor. 
Thai Iced Tea 5/5
- My go-to drink - has that nice blend of sweetness without being overly sweet.
Green Curry 4/5
-This was a new dish I tried today. You can scoop out the coconut insides that the curry comes in and eat it with the curry, which was interesting. It gave a nice contrast compared to the hot curry but I honestly didn't think the coconut did much. Curry flavor was not bland and it had a nice flavour. You can't control the spicy level for this dish. 
The dishes were definitely more than enough and I could have taken some home as leftovers.
Overall, definitely recommend! This restaurant is definitely not hyped. However, because of its popularity, there's probably going to be a long wait and lots of people are going to be at the restaurant, so might not be the place to dine-in if you just want a quick bite, are short on time or uncomfortable with crowds due to COVID or other reasons.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sonal R.,"So... I LOVE Thai food and this place so hyped up by my friends and we ended up going here for my ""send off party"" from my last job. The place was insanely busy! They don't take reservations and my poor friend had to hold a table from 5pm for a 6pm setting. Now is it worth the hype? ABSOLUTELY! I was doing the ""yummy food bop"" in my seat the entire time. And the cocktails were also a huge success. Good times! Great times! Definitely try Pai for great Thai (heh that rhymed)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edwin Y.,Its a good sign for a restaurant when it is busy at off times. I went on a weekday for lunch and it was packed. Even the rain didn't keep people away. This is a very good place to eat in with a great vibe. The flavors tasted authentic but I've only been to Thailand one time.  I understand why this place has so many reviews. I had the pad gra prow and pad thai. The rice was so good and the pad Thai was not too sweet. Great miz of sweet sour and savory.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Darshana M.,The best Thai restaurant in town. Fantastic Thai food and great cultural ambience. Have been there many times.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Glenn P.,"Pai, is a town in Northern Thailand where this nurse turned chef/ owner was from. The food was unpretentious and bold. Delicious would be an understatement. #paitoronto",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Takeshi Y.,"Food was excellent with great decor in the restaurant!! Vintage indeed.
I went there for lunch with a bit of a stomachache after eating so much the previous night. I just wanted something light and fresh. I tried their Pad Gra Paow with Chicken. It tasted very authentic and I felt like I was in Thailand, even from the setting of the place itself. The food was fresh and the chicken was juicy. I loved the runny yolk that came from the fried egg. The restaurant was inviting too and I'd definitely come back here another time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Donald K.,"Delicious food. Walked in party of 1, asked if the food could be made quickly because I was in a rush. The service was extremely quick in response and very friendly. Highly recommend their pad gra prow at the Thai spice level. Nose and mouth watering.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,K R.,"Fantastic food
Great ambiance
Great service
100% will be back
Everything we ate was a solid 10",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah M.,"The best Thai food I've had in Toronto! Can't believe a vegetarian spring roll can taste so good. The best green curry and it's served in a coconut... too bad you can't change the spice level, it's done medium spicy. We got their Pai Thai in Thai Spicy level... they don't mess around there, ouch but in a good way. Would def keep coming again & again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Blue A.,"Came here for a dinner with friends and really enjoyed it!
I started with the sangria with lychee. It was really refreshing and not overly sweet.
Get the green curry with chicken! This was recommended by a friend and it was fantastic. Comes with a side of rice.
Service was excellent as well!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rochelle C.,"I got the squash fritters and pad Thai via Ubereats takeout.
Squash fritters - huge portion, unique snacking type of appetizer that is similar to fries with dip. It's addictive and worth the big price tag 
Pad Thai - after being disappointed from pad Thai elsewhere, I was blown away by the flavour explosion in Chef Nuits pad Thai! The sauce and beef were very generous. Seriously, I had a beef slice in every bite! I just wish there was more veggie and tofu  I'm also glad this came with free chili oil as I selected medium spicy. It just gave me a little tongue tingle and was otherwise mild. Adding the chili oil made it perfect!!
I also got ""Extra green curry sauce"" for $3. I'm very glad this was an option, so that I can try another dish. I haven't opened it yet to taste, but it is a nice sampler size for $3. (note: it is purely sauce, no meat or veggies)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Prasiddha H.,"Ended up at Pai after reading countless reviews on it and seeing that they made really authentic Northern Thai food. I am a lover of asian food, especially Thai food so it was a no brainer that I try this place out. I ended up getting takeout food - and even when I went for pickup there were countless people around waiting to get their food which means its very fresh (which it was).
I ended up trying:
*Green Curry chicken - delicious and flavorful and came with lots of chicken and a side of rice which was nice
* Pad see ew - came with tofu and lots of veggies, this dish really hit the spot
*Penang curry - came with tofu as well - I enjoyed this more actually because I really like the peanuty curry like taste alot. Am a personal fan of this!
*Papaya Salad - all the flavors you want in a delicious, refreshing salad. Everyone who tried this in the house, loved it!
Overall, food was good - definitely expensive for the quantity, but I guess  that's due to downtown and the popularity.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,E. Y.,"We came in for dinner - better make reservations! The place is loud. Everything was really good! We had the beef curry, mango salad and pad tai chicken.  Dry tasty! Service is friendly and fast.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda M.,"I ordered from the vegan menu.  I ordered the omni ""pork"" pad gra prow and the chef nuit pad Thai.  They were AH-mazing!  They were so good that I had a difficult time stopping.  I wanted to make room for dessert.  It was so good that I ordered a second pad gra prow to take home with me for the next day.  We also ordered the coconut sorbet and shared it, but I think secretly we had wished we ordered one each.  I still can't believe that was vegan...it was a mind f***.  I want to try everything on the vegan menu.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shreeya L.,"Gread food and service. Loved it! 
 Very pretty and cozy ambiance. It's a must try. Best place for thai",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yasmin M.,"Very poor experience. We tried to reserve the table so that we get dinner before the show. Tried to call the restaurant, there is not even an option to reserve over the phone. Sent email with reservation details, never received any response. Tried to book with the Open Table, the earliest availability was 2 weeks away. Finally, decided to show up without the reservation, the place looks nice but we were told it will be an hour wait. We were very upset that we ended up wasting so much time and had to get sandwiched at nearby pub as we didn't have time for proper dinner before the show.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,The Uni 1.,"Came here on a recommendation and because it was rated best Thai restaurant in Toronto on Yelp. 
Had to wait about 35 mins after putting name in around 5ish. 
Guava juice and Thai iced tea were good, just a little bit too sweet.
Tom yum soup was nice. It's a sweet and sour soup and was very flavorful. 
The moo ping pork skewers were the best. 
Chicken satay with peanut sauce was just ok. I probably would not get this again.
I tried the khao soi with traditional braised beef as I had never heard of this dish before. It was very good, also rich and filling. Has a bit of a sweetness to it.  I dumped all 3 of the add-ons into the dish for more flavor. 
Coconut sorbet was lovely. It has noodles of the fresh young coconut and you can also scrape the fresh coconut from inside the shell. The entire inside of the coconut was also filled sorbet. The mango was a nice addition. I didn't care too much for the peanuts, but you can ask for without or just remove them to eat separately.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren B.,"Best Khao soi outside of Chiang Mai. Service was quick and efficient, food was excellent. A little noisy at times but when the food is so good, who cares?",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joe C.,"Absolutely fantastic food, good service and nice funky young ambiance. 
Ten out of ten.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Isabelle K.,"by far one of the best Thai food I have tried 
Definitely worth the wait and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting or in the area",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew K.,Excellent Thai food that we ordered for takeout and glad I did not try to walk in with a group during dinner because there was a long line to try and get in.  The khai soi with braised beef was amazing here.  I also loved their version of massaman curry with chicken and their pad thai and tom yum soup was also really delicious.  The khao pad baan nok fried rice with chicken and shrimp was also really good.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paul M.,"Our group of four had gone here right before Ontario started its QR codes for vaccinated people.
Regardless this Phai on Dundas in Toronto's DT was hard to get a table without long waits on a Saturday evening. Luckily, we reserved weeks in advance.
It's simple and had a good vibe.
$-$$",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine T.,"A must try!! I was actually blown away at how good the food here was. They were able to take something as simple as chicken skewers and turn it into something I felt like I was tasting for the first time. The pad thai was for sure better than average and the khao soi curry noddles .. wow. The curry was rich with coconut flavor and paired sooo well with the noodles and braised beef. I also really liked the addition of crispy noodles for texture. Everything was flavorful and delicious, the workers were friendly, cozy environment, no complaints here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Junior S.,"Covid delivery review!
First time trying this popular Toronto restaurant and definitely didn't disappoint!
Tom yum was very light on the stomach and had a few simple ingredients. The broth was the best part.
The curry was basically the same experience such that the curry sauce was my fav part.
Both items had a very rich flavour and were very easy on the stomach. I'd definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you haven't been here before.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel M.,"Visited Toronto for the weekend and a friend recommended we had to come here. We came around 4:30p before the dinner rush and put our name down, it was only about a 30 min wait and they texted us when our table was ready. When we came back, the line for the waitlist became pretty long.
We ordered:
- grabong 
- moo ping
- tom yum soup 
- pad thai
- khao soi
- green curry
- coconut sorbet
Our top choices were the grabong (squash fritters--one of their most popular items), moo ping (pork skewers) which were super juicy, and coconut sorbet! The Tom yum soup is pretty spicy! I can only handle mild spice so this was way too spicy for me. We ordered the khao soi with braised beef and green curry with chicken. The pad thai was nothing special in our opinion but I like that you can get mixed protein so we ordered ours with shrimp and chicken. My absolute favorite was the coconut sorbet which comes with fresh coconut shavings incorporated in the sorbet. The peanuts were a nice touch and an added texture/flavor that somehow complimented the whole thing very well and the tart mangos balanced the smooth milky flavor of the coconut sorbet.
All in all, a great spot. I would come back JUST for coconut sorbet though. It's pretty large so order to share!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole M.,"Amazing food. Well worth the wait. 
No pretense just authentic Thai. And affordable as a bonus!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Corey F.,"The mango slaw wasn't really tasty and I felt awful at having spent over $20 on it. Though it was a pretty large portion. Just wasn't for me.
The Pad Thai was only ok. Wasn't the best I'd ever had.
Don't think I'd repeat. Eat BKK Thai is much better.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelly B.,Thr khao Soy here is a highlight. Big space that feels empty most of the so it isn't a great place to take a date.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cindy T.,It's unfortunately non accessible if you're walking impaired. It's only a staircase with no access for any wheels. And nothing could be offered. Sad,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Helen T.,"Best Thai food I've ever had. The dining experience at Pai was truly exceptional. The dedication to authenticity, the skilled craftsmanship of the chefs, and the attentive service made it a dining delight. If you're a Thai food enthusiast or looking to embark on an unforgettable culinary journey, I wholeheartedly recommend Pai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Olivia C.,"I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for a long time to see what all the fuss was about. and WOW! The food was delicious. I ordered the green curry while my friends ordered the khao sai and pad see ew, which I tried all of. But I have to say, the pad see ew was my favourite; I kept stealing some. The hint of lime that comes with the pad see ew was absolutely delicious. Every bite had a flavour explosion from all of the food we ordered.
We did, however, order the Thai Ice Tea, which was not my favourite. It was my first time trying it, and I found it to be extremely sweet.
The servers were also extremely pleasant, and I was completely blown away by this restaurant. Will undoubtedly return soon.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anh P.,"Stumbled upon this restaraunt while taking a walk so my friend and I decided to give it a try. We came on a Saturday night so the line was a bit long. We waited ~20 minutes in line to put our name down. Once we put our name down, the wait was ~30-40 minutes. We were able to grab some drinks at the bar while we waited so that was nice! They also have an indoor waiting area with seats so the wait didn't feel too long. 
What we ordered: 
-Golden chicken nuggets: 10/10 when the order came out, I expected the nuggets to be smaller in size but it was like the size of chicken tenders. Definitely a shareable plate. It was SO delicious (especially with the sauce)
-Steak salad: 9/10 when the waiter recommended us this place I was like ehh.... but when it came out and I tried it, Wow! the salad sauce was soooo good and the steak was cooked to perfection. Must try!!! 
-Tom yum soup: 11/10 I have never tasted a tom yum soup as good as the one I tasted here. The broth was so rich in flavor and the spice was just right. 
-Khao Soi: 9/10 amazing! Curry broth flavor was SO delicious and the noodles were just perfect. If you're looking for a noddle curry dish, this is THE one!
-Pad thai: 8/10 it was really good! I've had a lot of pad thai's in my life so all I can say is that it tastes better than what I've had before. Giving it a 8/10 because I'm not a big fan of pad thai but just wanted to try it because of the amount of reviews this dish got
Overall, my experience here was great and I enjoyed every single dish I ordered. The vibes are immaculate and the service was AMAZING.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Robin S.,"Food is always good here! It's one of our go to spots. Dining in is better but there's usually quite a bit of a wait especially on weekends. We usually do take out which is still delicious. Spring rolls are the best, pad thai, Chiang Mai, khao soi, pad gra prow, massaman curry with beef, mango sticky rice. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Cheers!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Randy H.,Tastiest Thai food in Toronto.  Strong menu but expect a lot of dishes to only be served at dinner.  I came here on a weekday before TIFF and there was probably a 45 minute wait at 1pm.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aron J.,This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto.  I usually go with the green Thai curry and the dish always tastes fresh and flavorful.  Expect reasonable service.  In my opinion what really sets this restaurant apart is the food combined with the atmosphere.  The tropical stylings of the restaurant combined with vibrant music and tasty food really do make for a pleasurable dining experience.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dana L.,"This is one of the best Thai places I have ever been to. We came right when it opened and was able to get a spot without waiting (other than waiting for the people in front of us to get quickly seated). All the food was sooo good. They give so much vegetables, which I really appreciated. And everything came in large amounts. This was such a comforting meal that was super flavorful, but also not too salty. Best of all, the interior decorations were super nice too! Since we came for lunch, there was quite a few items that were unavailable until 4, so keep that in mind when you come!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joee G.,"We selected Pai after reading outstanding Yelp reviews. We came in on a Tuesday evening for dinner and there was a line up the stairs, out the door, and down the street. We placed our name on the waiting list and had a solid hour+ wait time to be seated. We enjoyed walking around the area and had a drink at the bar. I enjoyed the flavor of the lychee cocktail I ordered. The vibe of the restaurant is very unique, laid back, and casual. There is very dim lighting and neat decor. 
My husband and I shared chicken pad Thai and chicken Khao soi. We enjoyed both entrees but did not feel it was worth the long wait time and 'hype'. The pad Thai was flavorful but did not taste unique or different than my typical Thai take-out. And the khao soi had a great flavor to the broth, but the noodles were the wrong texture. I feel like it would have been better served over rice (or side of rice) or with the noodles typically used in pad see ew.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Catherine T.,"The food here is amazing with strong ad bold flavours and unique dishes (or a unique take on the dishes), and the portions are a good size. My favourite dishes are the khao soi, gaeng hunglay, pad gra prow, mango sticky rice and the thai iced tea. I prefer to share the dishes family-style so that everyone can try a bit of everything. 
There is usually a wait, so be prepared. One time, I popped in after a meeting at 3pm, hoping to snag a table for 1 and there was still a 20-30 minute wait. It is THAT popular, but I can assure you, the food and service are worth the wait! 
The take-out is also very good - they package the dishes in a way that maintains each dish's freshness (even though, sometimes the packaging can seem a bit wasteful, separating the noodles from the soup will prevent the noodles from overcooking, so there is a reason). 
I highly recommend Pai - it's my go-to place for authentic Thai cuisine. Once you've had it, you cannot go back to ketchup pad thai - you know what I'm talking about!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steph B.,Had the squash blossom app and it was divine!!! Just go here and order everything (food and drinks). It's so worth it. I'm definitely going again next time I'm in town! The layout and decor is gorgeous and so unique too!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tracy Y.,"Great food but hard to get a spot unless you go early
I ordered take out another time but they got my order wrong",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tina D.,"This place is great. Its got a basement feel though. Like you're underground low low cause you gotta walk down to your place. The food is bomb though. I got me some regular Pad Thai and it's good, for sure. 
The price was a bit steep cause your sister could have went to Thai Express but nah this place is authentic. It's worth the price to try some Thai food
The portions are big. I had to get a take out box and bring my noods home. I burped about 3 times so that's a good sign you're getting your money's worth. Some for now, some for later :D 
Overall good place. The people are nice. Chill vibe. This place is casual too so that's a bonus
I went back in June 2022 but yes they take Credit Card",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Valerie V.,"SOME OF THE BEST FOOD IVE HAD IN TORONTO! Their pad thai and every si gel one of the curries is to die for.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jo Ann E.,"Staff was friendly and the ambience was nice but the food arrived lukewarm. The green curry was a bit sweet for me, but I liked that it's served in a coconut and that they put more bamboo shoot instead of tons of ginger.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marcella Q.,"The ambiance is cool, chill, the music is good and up to date, not too laud so you can have a nice chat with your party. The food is delicious and tastes well-balanced. Only tried the two dishes in the pics and they are not spicy (I can't with spicy food) which is good because I thought Thai kitchen would be only spicy. The fried shredded buttercup squash is not oily and is not heavy, it's yummy! The egg noodles in the coconut milk curry is really good but it can be cloying by the end because there's the sweetness to it. The service... they are nice but it took to long to get the service and every time I asked for something it would take even longer... But overall I like it and would go again!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Greg H.,"Terrific selection, great service, center of everywhere. Very busy for a good reason. Get there early, expect a 20 minute wait. Pub like setting.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sameen A.,"the food is great
the service is a little slow
the ambience is exactly thailand. its a great escape right here in the city. 
its not authentic in that way that makes the environment third world and you are like where am I? thats a different level of interesting and nice, but this wasnt like that. 
this was upscale but also good food, and the ambiance was very classy but less than that.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,WY N.,Authentic Thai food. Always a queue outside the restaurant. Go early for a shorter wait in line,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rebecca R.,"Never disappoints. We order Pai from Kitchen Hub A LOT. And I have eaten at the Duncan location several times. Just no weak links! Highlights - Tom yum soup, pad thai, green curry. The khao soi is suuuuuuper rich. I couldn't eat it alone, it's a must share. This place is worth the hype!",5

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel G.,"Ill start by saying we had to wait about an hour to get seated, and the guy taking our name put down 7 people when it was just the 2 of us, which may have made the wait a bit longer, so that was a little annoying. When we finally got seated, the service was good and fast. We ordered the pad thai and the khao soi. My only real complaint was that the khao soi would have been much better if it was served with rice instead of noodles. The flavor was good. The pad thai was good.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike C.,Amazing service!  I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful place! there's a reason why this place has a Michelin award. All of our meals are so so good,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jill P.,This is the best restaurant we ate at in Toronto. The food was phenomenal as well as the sangria! Service was great and the ambiance was perfect. HIGHLY recommend!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emilie S.,One of the best meals I have ever had!  The restaurant and their story is very quaint and unique making for a great and memorable experience.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rory B.,"traveling in the area and had a taste for Thai. the reviews alone were enough to make me want to try Pai. However, not being from toronto, I had no idea how bad traffic would be downtown. Holy cow, it was excruciating. an hour to go 5 miles. THat said, it was totally worth it. 
before ordering i look over at two young women who had jsut received their order. after the first bite, one of them tossed her head back and had the biggest smile on her face. 
colleague and i each has a small bowl of tom yum, split an order of Spring Rolls, and we split the pad thai and the massamam curry. yeah this is 100% a revisit. the food was great and even worth that terrible  drive.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelly W.,"10/10 absolutely recommend. I was in Toronto for 3 days and went here twice because of how yummy kr was!! I had the green curry (comes in a coconut!) and it was so perfect and a little spicy! My friends for the pad Thai, which was sooo very yum. I went back for the pad Thai the next day and ate every drop of my leftovers. Also enjoyed the garlic fried shrimp and the spring rolls! Even the sangria was amazing. Don't hesitate. Go NOW!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stan G.,"I've tried a lot of different Thai restaurants and I will have to say this was definitely the best. The Tum Yum soup had a ridiculous amount of flavor, the curry was great and the NBA themed drinks were cool. The overall ambiance of this place is something to enjoy as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Naveen M.,Not even going to bother rating this restaurant. Sent an email for reservation 3 weeks early as requested by them and had to reemail as no answer after 10 days and then get the response that they are full and made a mistake with reading the email. NOT going to this restaurant and don't recommend them base on this experience,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zinna S.,"Absolutely worth the hype! Came on Sunday at opening time without a reservation and were seated right away. The decor inside is very welcoming and bright, the music complemented to make a chill vibe. Our waiter informed us they only accept credit card and have a 90 minute table limit. 
The thai iced tea is delicious - perfect level of sweetness and crushed ice assures it doesn't get watered down. The pad see ew was flavorful and had a great ratio of noodle to greens to shrimp. The hot chili flakes on the side was a nice addition with a squeeze of lemon. Portion size was large. Pad thai was also excellent! The service is fast and attentive. Best restaurant experience I've had in Toronto so far.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shawn N.,The service is mixed. Decent food. Look like a scene in a movie. I say it is overrated.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marco M.,"Went by a week or 2 after lockdown, dine in reservations were full, only walk-in first come first serve. Only waited about 20-30 minutes. 
First time experiencing Pai as a friend recommended this place. Thai milk tea was very nice just a hint too sweet for me but tasted quite authentic as I have been to Thailand. 
Also ordered PAD THAI, thai spicy. Very nice kick as I'm used to spicy food",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vaibhav G.,"This review is almost 2 years late. But it has always been a great dining experience at Pai. I will more so often get the pad gra, the squash fritters and the thai ice tea and it never fails to amaze me. The service is alright, could it get better? Definitely. Love the ambiance and the small market at the back.",5

Couldn't secure a reservation during my visit to Toronto but they take walk-ins so that's what I did. The wait for a party of 2 on the evening (the day after new year) was estimated to be about 20 minutes but we were seated before that. 
For drinks I had the regular Thai tea and then later an alcohol version of Thai tea  featuring vodka (yea, you read that right!! IT was rather tasty!)
The spring rolls and tom yum soup were  our appetizers of choice. The rolls were fried with cabbage and mushrooms inside. The soup served with mushrooms and shrimp was flavorful and well balanced.
The khao soi and pad krapow were our entrées of choice. The pad krapow came out with the fried egg and rice and tasted as it should. And khao soi was truly excellent. The curry was  possibly one the best I've tasted .
Overall, Pai lived up to my expectations and to it's name. By the time we walked out, there was a line of people waiting to be seated that went around the block it seemed and when I saw that, I nodded in agreement. Worth the wait!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stanimir C.,"It's the third time I've been here and it's probably my favorite Thai restaurant in whole of Toronto and one of the best overall. Even after years away it's just as popular as it was the fist time I was there. At 2pm on Saturday we had to wait 30 min to be seated and didn't get any less busy afterwards. There were some new additions to the menu such as the oxtail dish with garlic and rice(pictured). It does feel similar to something else I've eaten before, but definitely had this extra flavour. The pad Thai and the curry are classic dishes but still so tasty. Service is great considering how busy they were. Spilled some water on the table and they cleaned it immediately. Someone even came to check if we are okay shortly. Its the kind of place I'd never get tired of visiting. Too bad I won't be staying in the city much longer.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tish K.,"It lives up to the name, as the service, the atmosphere and most importantly the food are absolutely amazing! Its worth the wait, and I love that the only thing that you have to accept is a bit of a wait due to limited reservations. The curries are all amazing, dabang is worth trying and pad thai is great! The skewers are a great addition as well! I love it and prices are very reasonable for being in downtown and for the quality!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea L.,All I have to say is I love Nathan and nay nae. they're the best. they're shots are not watered down! Nay nae is such a genuine soul!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Farheen S.,"Pai has its fair share of rave reviews, and I have to agree for the most part. I've been 4-5 times before and it's always busy. There is ALWAYS a wait if you're going to walk in. We went on a Saturday night and surprisingly only waited 15 min for a table for 2. I've had to wait for over an hour during previous visits. Pai makes you feel like you're on a street in Thailand, experiencing their vibrant street foods. Service is casual and friendly - they are always super busy so I was satisfied with the level of attention from the wait staff. 
1) squash fritters - a crispy delicious finger food, served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. I just found the fritters a little mushy towards the middle, I wish the whole fritter was as crispy as the edges. 
2) pad Thai - excellent!! One of the best pad Thais I've had, super balanced flavours and the medium spicy was perfect for us. 
3) green curry - served in a young coconut, I did not really enjoy this. The curry was watery and the chicken was very dry. The only part I enjoyed was scraping the coconut pulp out of the shell.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica M.,"WOW!! Completely understand why this restaurant has such amazing reviews. We arrived here around 7:15pm and only waited 15 minutes before being seated. There's a designated area for those waiting for seating so customers aren't standing around the entrance. 
We ordered the spring rolls (vegetarian), Chef Nuit Pad Thai, and Khao Soi. For the dishes, you're able to select the level of spiciness as well. This was my first time trying Khao Soi at any thai restaurant and I was blown away! The broth was creamy and the dishes were all cooked and seasoned to perfection. 
Definitely one of our favorite meals in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ash S.,"Authentic and very delicious Thai food. This time I was able to get a reservation for dine in, which was nice. Their Khao soi is slightly more watery than other ones I've had, but creamy and flavorful nonetheless. The pork rib soup was sour, spicy, and addictive; they don't skimp on the meat. 
I would actually recommend sitting inside rather than on their two patios, as the interior is beautifully decorated and outside can smell a little like sewer if the wind isn't blowing in your favor",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeff L.,"So this is a really interesting place, the decor is very Thai local feel and the food was fantastic. We did a shared big plate witha  variety of items and all of them were very good. The pork skewers were excellent, the lettuce wraps were very good and the fried stack of sweet potatoes was also great. We had a vegitarian at the table so we did an order of the fried Tofu and I usually hate tofu but this was pretty darn good. They have a lot different cocktails but we got a bottle of wine which was priced well and overall pretty good. This is a good value and some of the best Thai food. I will be back for sure next trip to Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sneha D.,"Amazing place. To be honest my first visit wasn't that great, but every other time it has been the best. Definitely the Thai place I would take my family or friends to if they ever visit Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael M.,"Went here for lunch. Other than having to wait for a table, it was terrific!   The food was definitely worth the wait.  I had a pad Thai dish and my coworker had a fried rice dish.  Both were amazing.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brandon A.,"Honestly, not sure why this place is so hyped. As an American I'm wondering if this is the only Thai place in Downtown Toronto. The wait is at least 30-40 minutes and the food was just average. I've definitely had better Thai food in America West Coast. We ordered the beef Salad and the Khao Pad Thamada. The beef salad flavor was good, but the beef was a bit over cooked. We ordered pork the the Khao Pad Thamada and it was a bit too sweet  and oily for us. Honestly, if this place was so hyped (over 3k reviews) I'd say this place is pretty good, but the wait time and the amount of reviews isn't worth the quality of food served here.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ronni T.,"Came across this restaurant while browsing food places closeby the DoubleTree hotel. It was about a 13 min walk and my boyfriend and I came at 9pm. We were thinking the crowd would die down by then but we were wrong. The restaurant was still packed. We were able to get seated quickly. 
I ordered the pad Thai and my boyfriend ordered the pad gra prow. I can't have spicy so I ordered no spice. You have the option of adjusting the spice level. My boyfriend got medium spice for his dish. He cleaned his plate good and ended up finishing mine. Portions were good for the price. Plates range starting from $15-16. Quality and flavors were there so it was a good meal. We loved the playlist they were playing and the ambiance. It was pretty loud in there with the music playing and the crowd, but we enjoyed our meal. Servers gave us great and fast service!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eric M.,"Great Thai food.  Good service.  Really enjoyed our meal at Pai.  Highly recommend, it's well worth the wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sally L.,"This is absolutely my favourite Thai restaurant in the city - It's my go to hands down and one of my top 10 restaurants that I recommend to any of my friends who aren't from Toronto to visit. 
Their khao soi is one of the best dishes on their menu - noodles and soup curry with braised beef? Hell yes! 
Another one of their recommendations are their pad Thai - hands down one of the best pad thai I've ever had in Toronto. It's not so ketchup-y like most places make it. 
Moo ping- one of my other favourites for appetizers- this dish is SO GOOD. Sometimes it sells out so you won't be able to order ( had that happen to me many times) so I highly suggest trying this out if they don't "" run out"" 
grabong- super good !! It's a good snack that's pairs great with beer or alone! 
Overall I highly highly recommend trying pai out if you are in town in the downtown toronto core. 
Ps. You will be waiting approx 1-2 hours for a table
If you walk in. But trust me, it's worth the wait!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Barbara J.,"Excellent restaurant, excellent food, good service!
Best pad Thai ever, great apps.
Line seemed long but it is a much bigger place then you realize and we didn't wait very long to sit.
Good system with everyone working together, would definitely return.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sue S.,"ooooo, i'm SO glad my sister's friend recommended this place to us because it was genuinely one of the best thai places i've been to in a long while. there was a waiting list of an hour but time quickly passed since we walked to the toronto sign and back. parking was pretty easy to find (not free - metered). the staff was awesome, very insightful and attentive. we started off with thai iced tea, chicken wings, moo ping & gai satay (skewers). we got two main entrees - pad thai & khao si. i'm personally not a fan of pad thai so i only had the khao si but it was really good. we ended the night with drinks (i got the summer dog). had a very good experience - definitely recommend & want to come back",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hannah C.,"Located in the heart of downtown, this is definitely a hidden gem. 
Very down to earth, and a nice place to chill and dine with friends or family. They do also have a bar area for solo diners. I do not recommend this place if you are looking for a quiet romantic date. However if you seek an upbeat, busy yet savoury food, this is your go to. 
If you crave Thai food, their food here is flavourful and delicious. You can tell they use fresh ingredients to make a great meal. 
Definitely a must try for Thai cuisine.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark K.,"This is my absolute favourite Thai restaurant in
Toronto downtown.
It takes some time to get a table, but worth the wait. The staff is friendly and the food is good.
Pad Grow Prow - 8.5/10 
a little over salted
Pad See Ew - 10/10
I would order Pad Thai and Pad See Ew next time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hetty Y.,"4 stars for cool ambiance, aesthetics and service. Food was beautifully presented and some of the appetizers were very good and different than Thai food Im used to. They were able to accommodate our huge group with such short notice. Definitely a different type of Thai restaurant and from what the locals say this was a very popular spot!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kyle L.,"This is a great place... the ambience, the service and the food are amazing!
4 stars for giving us 90 minute to dine, yet it is understandable because there was a long line when we got out. If you can't make a reservation, get in line, it is  worth it! Staff are friendly and the food are delicious!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason C.,Had the Beef brisket khao soi here and it was delicious. Also the fritters were tasty!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cel L.,"This place is definitely one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto! The flavours are very authentic and I am still craving this now as I write this. Reservations are preferred, especially for a large group as this restaurant is extremely popular and crowded. The decor is very welcoming and unique, with vintage items on the walls and tables. I would recommend dining in the separate area in the back, as it is quite loud and may be too noisy for some. 
My favourite dishes are the pad gra prow (Basil Stir-Fry Beef with steamed jasmine rice) and the green curry that comes inside a coconut, which is a nice touch. I don't normally have a high spice tolerance, but the medium spice level was just right for me or it would be too bland otherwise. I also loved their Thai Iced Tea which was very rich and refreshing! Look forward to my next visit!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Abby P.,Amazing service. Despite being busy they have a great system for getting you seated quickly. Such a cool vibe in there. Some of the best Thai food I've had in a while. Cant wait to come back when I am in Toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Monica N.,"Hands down my go to Thai place in Toronto. The vibes are so great, and the decor takes me back to when I was in Thailand with my group of friends. Their Pad Thai is one of my favourites and I always recommend this restaurant to my friends who visit the city.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David K.,"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen was born out of a love story. The couple who opened this eatery met in Thailand and wanted to bring their love of Pai to Toronto, and now this must be the busiest Thai restaurant in the entire city! The Plah Nua was a beef sirloin steak grilled to a juicy medium and dressed with shallots, lemongrass, and other herbs and served over chopped lettuce and shredded cabbage. From the section of the menu labeled ""Chef Nuit's Favorites,"" the Khao Soi was a bowl of egg noodles in a coconut milk curry, served with chunks of braised beef and topped with crispy noodles, along with pickled mustard greens, onion, chili oil, and lime on the side. But my favorite dish (though not by far) was the Kanom Jim Nham Ngeaw, a soup made of pork ribs, tomatoes, and chilies, topped with crispy pork rinds and served with rice noodle bundles, shredded cabbage, lime, pickled mustard greens, and red chili powder on the side. The soup had a complex sweet, sour, hot and spicy flavor that was more than the sum of its parts, and the meaty, fatty pork ribs were tender and flavorful. Overall, though the service wasn't a highlight (as the place was super busy), this was a fantastic Thai restaurant with a funky, casual vibe and uncompromised flavors!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Soheil M.,We walked miles to get to this place after looking them up on Yelp and seeing their 3k+ reviews. It was well worth it. The food was fantastic. The atmosphere was hip and full of positive energy. We highly recommend this place.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shubhi A.,"With their new vegan options they won my 4 stars!!!  They have scope to be better to be 5 but yeah now I visit them more often and recommend to fellow vegan and vegetarian yelpers.
The ambiance has always been great, not quite but more celebration kind. The seating is a little cramped but again they have always a queue, everyone wants to have a good food , I don't mind that. Their bar selection and cocktails have always been decent. And now they have both regular and vegan / vegetarian food selection and so far what ever I tried was great. Above average Thai food. Their curries are so balanced and fresh . The appetizers are yumm. Portions are fairly sized. I love their Chilli sauce... and they accommodate every spice level to a perfection. 
Great place to go when you crave Thai food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark T.,"Alright, alright, I'll grant the coveted 5th star. The food was amazing, but while the food came out fairly quick, the service seemed overwhelmed by the business that evening (a little short handed perhaps?). They were, however kind enough to permit me to swap the Spicy P for something else, more on that later.
This place is popular and gets packed quick. Saturday at ~4:30 there was hardly a spot left, I got lucky and was able to snag a seat at the rear bar.
There was a little bit of a queue for the Host Stand which moved a little slow. To the staff's credit, it seemed like they were juggling a lot: seating guests, phone calls, etc. 
I started off with the Spicy P to drink, and it was fire! Don't get me wrong, it was quite tasty, until you transformed into a fire-breathing dragon. Mind you I have a higher than average heat tolerance.
They were kind enough to let me swap it for something else, and I opted for The Serge Protector.  This one hit all the right notes: it was gently sweet, savory, not too heavy, with pleasant foam and just the right amount of heat!
Getting the drinks took a little while; but there was only one bar for an almost packed house.
For a main, I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with crisp pork. This dish was delicious from the bottom up. The rice was cooked perfectly, and the sauce that made its way there gave it great flavor! The veggies gave a great amount of freshness. The meat was extremely flavorful, cooked perfectly, and especially with the Crisp Pork added some wonderful texture variety. 
I was also extremely fond of the portion size that was filling, yet didn't have me bursting at the seams. I also liked that it wasn't the overly saccharine.
This dish was to come to a Chili Oil, which I alas received towards the very end of the meal when almost everything was eaten. 
The service was very polite, but a bit overwhelmed or short-handed that night. Also, the story of the couple that openness this place is awesome!
Well done, folks!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine Marie L.,"Good food
Great ambient
The crew are so nice
Will back to try the other menus for sure!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karmen N.,"I am blown away. I don't remember why I thought it deserved a 3 star.
Came here during lunchtime on a weekday and we didn't have to wait. There's actually a whole another big room behind the main area!
The khao soi was amazing. Very rich sweet salty soup full of coconut taste and flavourings. The noodles were tender and the crispy noodles were fried perfectly. So delicious, recommend! Waiter was really passionate and friendly too.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Queena O.,Came all the way from So California for the best Thai food I've ever had!   Had to come here based on the recs of friends and reviews.  The presentation and flavors were on point.  Everything was delish.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jesse S.,"Very good option for Thai food in Toronto, very consistent and always yummy! Definitely a little more authentic than most of the Thai restaurants in the city.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Subu D.,"Hearty Thai food in Toronto. Was fairly busy but got seated at the bar promptly as a single diner. Rich and deep flavors, with an outstanding curry base. Comparable with some of the finest Thai I have had in North America and worth the 15 min Uber ride to the spot. Fast and attentive service. Minor details like cooking the potatoes a tad bit more would have earned them a five star rating.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Trisha C.,"Came here with my family. It was super packed on a Friday night with people lining on the stairs at both ends and outside. However, there is plenty of seatings (someone mentioned there were over 75 seats), and our wait time was less than 25 minutes. 
The place is dimly lit, but it is well decorated. We were seated all the way in the back, and they truly make use of all the spaces available to them. 
We ordered Grabong (so many pictures of it on Yelp, and it is definitely something that you should just dive right in when it is served), Thai Chicken Wings (only 3 pieces, which was pricey, but the sauce was on point), and I had its Green Curry. The green curry was served inside a coconut, but they would give me a side of extra broth (and protein!) and rice. I can then dump everything in a bowl and eat it like that. Service was very quick despite how packed the place was. Prices are reasonable.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Connie C.,"I was so hyped for Pai given all the reviews, but coming from the Bay area where we have tons of delicious food, this place fell short. It was absolutely packed and the dishes looked great, but honestly it was just average Thai food. It took over 20 minutes for a server to even get us beverages. Tables and chairs were sticky, and the service was so slow the whole time. Portions were fair, but beyond that I have nothing much more to say.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chinsin S.,"Holy cow. Like wow. I came to Pai Northern Thai Kitchen with extremely high expectations because everyone and their mothers (and fathers, aunts, uncles and neighbors) was raving about this amazing restaurant.
And. It. Did. Not. Disappoint.
I was thoroughly impressed with Pai from the very start. The venue is nested in a very busy area in Downtown Toronto. It's a bit unassuming at first, but once you walk in --- it's like you're in a whole new place. I decided to venture out to this popular (and extremely highly sought out restaurant) on Sunday afternoon during TIFF. Yeah, lol. Big mistake. I waited in line with 50+ other folks before they opened at 3PM and luckily made the first wave. 
I ordered the following:
Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Shrimp for $18.50 The dish was sprinkled with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives and stir fried in a delicious, homemade tamarind sauce.
Okay, okay. I know what you're thinking. How can Pad Thai taste so good? Isn't it the same everywhere? And even if it was ""amazing,"" is it really that game-changing? Yes, it is. The flavor packed a huge punch.
Side note: The noodles were cooked inconsistently i.e. some parts were soggier than others. However, the flavor really made up for it a lot. I was extremely impressed and couldn't help, but savor each and every bite.
Thai Chicken Wings for $6, which comes in three. They were layered with crispy shallots, lemongrass and crispy chillies with a sweet tamarind sauce. This was a great compliment to my dish.
Overall, I would strongly recommend making a stop at Pai Norther Thai Kitchen. Trust the reviews -- it's that good and totally worth the wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle T.,"So glad my guy finally decided to try Thai food, and pai of all places!
I've only heard good things from this place. I had the pad Thai with chicken, mild spicy, and he had a beef curry with rice.
His beef curry was pretty spicy and it eventually gave a kick near the end. Portions were a good size! We felt full but not bursting at the seams. He did have food coma later.
I had the pad Thai and it was p lit. The peanuts were actually underwhelming but the tamarind sauce gave a nice umami flavour to the whole thing. Good ratio of meat to noodles and the banana leaf was a nice touch :) a tad salty though... I downed a ton of water near the end and needed gum.
Overall a great place for a cute date idea. Come at opening time to secure a seat because this place gets packed really fast!",4

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristen H.,"Oh wow!!! 
So ..I had posted on Facebook that I was in Toronto and a friend in Manhattan commented that I needed to try Pai Northern Thai Kitchen so we stopped in after seeing Military Wives at TIFF.
If I could give this restaurant a 10 I would!
We thought it would be easy to get a table at 3:30pm but we had a 35min wait! That gave me a clue that we were in  a good spot!
We started with drinks while we waited - the kwahian Punch was so good !! We shared the pad Thai with shrimp and the chasing mai beef noodle soup!  Our neighbor shared her Kung tawt garlic shrimp. We also got to see her gaing kiaw wan in a coconut bowl - she raved about it!
Both of our dishes were amazing -the Pad Thai a bit sweeter than I have had before. The soup was enough for two! I wish we had room in our bellies to try it all!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Barrett J.,"I would consider myself a Thai food connoisseur, and Pai certainly did not disappoint ( My girlfriend who is new to Thai food will also agree). Possibly the best Panang curry I've ever had in my life. Not to mention the coconut sorbet might have been the most memorable dessert I've had in a very long time (still dreaming about it). Don't wait until last minute to get here though, they get on a wait fast and if you don't get there before 6:00pm it's likely you'll have to wait some time. All in all it was a super cool restaurant experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dhruv G.,"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto over the years. Pad thai here is the best in Toronto and I've visited Thailand too. They don't take reservations which is really irritating and stops me from visiting often, but this is the one trust me.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mat F.,Always had good food however the service a lot of the time has been really bad. Not sure why. Just very dismissive. Like they don't want you there.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Luke H.,"Arrived around 5 pm on a Thursday night and it was packed, but we were able to get a table and noticed that the place is huge. 
Service was quick and I was expecting something delicious... Pad Thai with shrimp was more sweet than spicy even though I requested medium. Wife ordered Tom Yum Kung and it was okay, likewise for the rice unless you like it on the hard side. 
Got some good pics, but that's it...
This place is no 4.5 stars as advertised/reviewed",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Connie W.,"Pai is a town in Northen Thailand, thus the street sign is used as the restaurant sign.  It is a not a fancy posh sign but simple and rustic to reflect the ambiance of the interior. 
We heard this place gets very crowded and we had a large group of 10 but we found out their machine system does not allow for same day reservations.   On a Tue at 5pm, some of us showed up and were seated immediately at a table even though not everyone arrived until 5:30.  By then, there was a long line out the door.
GRABONG - Popular appetizer of deep fried shredded kabocha (buttercup squash). It tasted similar to sweet potato fries.
PAPAYA SALAD - It was presented nicely in sectional ingredients which made it hard work for us to break the chips and pork rinds and unravel the noodles and mix everything together. (not user friendly so I would not recommend this)
GAENG MASAMAN CHICKEN- This is mild sweet curry with meat, potatoes, onion, peanuts, tamarind, coconut milk, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  Can't go wrong with this beginners curry, even for kids.
GAENG PANAG BEEF- Red curry made with red chillies and coconut milk, shrimp paste, kaffir lime leaves, eggplant and meat.  It was good.
GAENG KIAW WAN FISH - Green curry made with green chillies and coconut milk, bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, bell peppers.  This is their most popular curry, thus served in a coconut.
PAD THAI VEGGIES - typical pad thai with lots of stuff; better than I can make it.
MANGO STICKY RICE - up to my standards but nothing special
I was impressed with the server's knowledge of the food.
She asked if we have any dietary restrictions, we replied that one person cannot eat shrimp else he swells up.  She then told us which dishes on our list contained shrimp by products and which ones were clear for him to eat.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Art K.,"Strongly recommend. Some of the tastiest Thai food we've had. The service was excellent. Note, I would have given 5 stars had the Tom Yom Soup not been served late and cold. I had to send the soup back to he reheated. The dining environment is trendy and very busy, but comfortable. The food was so good we'll make the drive or take the GO train to dine there again.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lilian L.,"I had some guests from the states coming so I decided to take them to Pai. I had never actually dined in the restaurant but have had take out from Pai and it was amazing. This review is based on my experience in the restaurant. I was able to get a reservation for 4 on Open Table 2-3 days in advance for Saturday night. Definitely made the right call since there was a huuuge line when we got to the restaurant, and as we were leaving at around 7:30, the line extended to almost around the corner of Duncan and Adelaide.
We started off with the papaya salad, tom yum soup, and Pai sangria. At first, I said that I didn't like salads and probably would not eat much of the salad. My friends ordered it anyway, and I ended up having a lot of the papaya salad. It was soooo good. It came in a platter and we were advised that it can be eaten all mixed or like nachos. We ended up eating them like nachos and it was fantastic. I loved their tom yum soup, it may even be the best I've ever had. The tom yum soup was so flavorful, not like the watered downed stuff you see at other Thai restaurants. We shared four mains--Pad Thai with Shrimp, Hunglay Oxtail, Khao Soi with chicken drumsticks, and Gaeng Penang with beef. They were all amazing and extremely flavorful but I think my favorite was the Khao Soi and Hunglay Oxtail. The Hunglay Oxtail was not spicy and is a good option for those who can't handle spice.
Overall, our experience at Pai was amazing, the service is a little slow, but it's understandable since the restaurant is crazy busy all the time. Great choice for impressing your guests as well as your taste buds",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin C.,"Expensive (dinner), over-crowded, bad air-quality and food was okay-ish. I've tried Pai multiple times and I still don't understand why it deserves such a huge crowd. The interior is dark, crammed, and extremely loud. This is not a great place for socials (dates/friends/family). You almost have to yell for someone to hear you. If you want to eat Pai, go very early, eat, and get out ASAP. It's just not a great environment. I especially don't like the fact they limit the reservations so you pretty much have to book 1 month in advance if you want to reserve online (which explains the line because no one could reserve).
As for the food, it's about 4 stars for certain items and some 3 stars. They are not bad, but not like the best Thai either. The food decor is nice yet the Khao Soi beef I had was dry and hard to chew. Food portions is also quite small, you'd definitely need appetizers. For the price that it charges, I don't think it's a good deal.
Pai has really good location and it's the closest Thai restaurant to the Financial District, that's why it attracts all these office workers. But it doesn't live up to its hype. I recommend going to Khao San Road nearby for much better quality food, ambience, prices, service and quantity.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leah M.,The food could have been better and I wasn't blown away. Khao San Road is better. The service is good though.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ken C.,"A wonderful example of Thai food. The plan Curry was deliciously creamy yet had a mouth spice, which we ordered. 
my favorite item was actually on the dessert menu. The mango sticky rice was amazing. The mango was cut nicely and ripe and juicy. 
The ambiance is no frills and there are so many seating options from the bar to two different dining. It's good for groups all the way down to a solo lunch.
It's a bit of a wait at times. Our 3 p.m. lunch on a Friday was super busy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yashaswita B.,"Great food, wait times could be daunting though. I loved my Penang Curry and Mango Sticky Rice. I asked for 8/10 spice and I feel it was still mild for my tastebuds. Do ask for their Chili Oil, it's a life savior if you like hot and spicy food like I do!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cher A.,"My friend and I came here for dinner before going to a play and had an ok experience. 
The Ambiance:
The ambiance is pretty cool and this place is much bigger than it looks. It is underground and they have tables with beach umbrellas and the vibe makes you feel like you are above ground. 
The Service:
The service has pros and cons. We were seated at the bar relatively quickly with how busy the restaurant was. We placed our orders and saw people around us who ordered after us receiving their food. We waited over an hour for our food until I said something to an employee. They went to the kitchen to check on our orders and came back with our dishes which were now cold. I'm pretty sure they were forgotten in the kitchen and just sitting there. My friend sent hers back and I just ate mine since I was famished at this point. My friend had to send her dish back 2 more times before it came back at a decent temperature. My dish was just Luke warm. 
The Food:
I ordered the green curry dish. It was really spicy and really flavourful. It is served in a real coconut, which makes it pretty cool since you can also eat the coconut meat. The dish was like warm and didn't come with enough vegetables. I wish the waitress told me that I could have added vegetables to my dish when I placed the order. I was told about this after I ate my meal and I then placed an order for a side of steamed vegetables due to my food allergies. 
My friend ordered the an ox dish and she found it way too fatty and extremely cold. She was not a fan!
Would I return?
Possibly but I would opt to try other restaurants before going back here.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Crystal L.,"Came here around 4:30pm. There was already a line up. I roughly waited around 30 mins, and got a table.
The restaurant feels very homey. Just Like a local thai restaurant.
I ordered the chicken wing, vegetarian pad thai and a cold thai ice tea.
The chicken wings are crispy and not too dry. The sauce on the side is a sweet and sour. I just wish there was more. 
Pad thai with vegetarian and tofu came after. It looks ascetically pleasing. The vegetables came with bean sprouts, broccoli and cauliflower. If you can do spicy, medium spicy gives u little hit on ur tongue. But if you cant eat spicy, beware of the spiciness level you choose. Overall, the noodles are soup but not too mushy, 5/5!! 
The only thing i didn't like is the side dry lettuce. Great of appearance, but very dry and flavourless. 
P.S. If you are not a fan of coriander, remember to ask them to take it out. 
Overall experience 5/5!! Would recommend making reservations to avoid the wait line. Real Authentic Thai food right here!! (:",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marianne C.,"I've heard really good things about this restaurant and so I figured I'd come check it out after a long day of conferencing in Downtown Toronto.
Despite being a solo-diner, lining up still took 20 minutes or so before someone was able to find me a seat. The location is much bigger than I thought, and as my host walked me to my seat, I was amazed to find out how many more 'sections' there are inside the restaurant. So, lesson learned: even if there's a long line up, don't lose hope, because there's PLENTY of seats inside - you just have to wait for your turn!
I ordered the Khao Soi, and it is, by far, the best curry noodle dish I have ever had in my life! No wonder people line up in this place! The chewy noodles and the creamy (slightly spicy?) curry soup is just truly amazing! What a heavenly experience! I think next time though, I will order drumstick for my chicken, instead of breast meat. I think it will be more flavourful this way.
Service was a relatively slow during my visit (peak hours), I thought. 
Overall, this is a MUST TRY place if you're ever in downtown Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sharon L.,"Some of the best Thai food in the city. Reasonably priced, with large portions. Good balance of noodle to topping ratio. Do make reservations otherwise walk-in has long lines most days. Food does come quickly.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Harold S.,"The venue is quite loud. Over 80 and sometimes reaching 100. The food was OK but found it was too sweet. 
I was not impressed.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tracey R.,"Best Thai food in the city, bar none. I've eaten at two different locations and each location is fun, colorful, clean with great wait staff and an amazing menu. Highly recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leslie T.,"My husband and I were in Toronto for 24 hours and we had heard this is the absolute place to go. So we went - and we were not disappointed! We were so excited actually that we ordered 1 app and 3 entrees because we wanted to try as many things as we could in our short time in town. We were not disappointed! We ordered the pork pad see ew, penang curry, khao soi and pork spring roll appetizers. Honestly, would pass on the spring rolls. The meat inside was dry and the outside was a big stiff, not crunchy enough. Khao soi was relatively similar to the penang curry but the penang curry had more of a sweet undertone. I loved the penang curry so much I packed it up to take home to America, but of course, realized that I would never be able to pass airport security with it *sad face* They have a nice little waiting area off to the side where you can relax and order drinks before you're seated for your meal.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Frances M.,"Excellent food but busy so plan accordingly. I had the Pad Thai and the portion was generous and the perfect amount of spicy! Overall, this is a place every tourist and local alike must experience if they are ever in the area. It's worth the wait!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maoreen Rose M.,"Great ambiance! Good service! Amazing food! Best combo for best experience. 
I ordered Pad Sew Ew and Red Curry, both tasted awesome and were generous in size. The ambience makes you feel like you are in the streets of Thailand, and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Would definitely come back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jack M.,"Came here alone and got a seat at the bar while groups waited what seemed like an hour for a table. 
I ordered the Khao Soi. It's egg noodles and beef in a curry sauce/soup. 
This was an excellent dish. The curry sauce was luxuriously smooth, thick, buttery, creamy, and aromatic. The blend of spices was complex. 
The egg noodles tasted freshly made and had a pleasant egginess, spring, and chew. 
The beef was tender and almost fall apart (though not perfectly executed). 
Sitting atop the bowl were crispy fried straws of something (maybe onion?)
This is an excellent dish. And it's their most popular. I suggest you order it when you go.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clire C.,"First time trying PAI and it was soooo delicious! Got their shrimp pad thai ($20) & their chicken khao soi ($18). The khao soi was honestly the best I've had! Soup was flavourful, the perfect amount of curry and coconut milk. For drinks, we got a pineapple shake ($6) and mango juice ($4) which was super refreshing .
Lastly, we ended off with their mango sticky rice ($10). 
I reserved one month in advance on opentable for a table for 2 for a Sunday at 6pm. They're always super busy and lunch and dinner times are always full so make sure to reserve early!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raquel F.,"Let me just start by saying this was the best pad thai I've ever eaten. Now, I'm not sure how much that is saying considering I'm not an avid Thai food eater; however, this is the best tasting one I've ever eaten. The portion was generous and the dish had the perfect amount of sweetness and saltiness. I ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai, inclusive of stir fried rice noodles, house-made tamarind sauce, beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime, home roasted peanuts, choice of chicken, beef or tofu and veggies. The lime adds a nice touch at the end. The cost was either 14 or 15 Canadian dollars. 
We also ordered the spring rolls, inclusive of deep fried vegetarian rice paper wraps, mushrooms, glass noodles, carrots. sprouts served with sweet and spicy Thai chilli sauce. Those spring rolls were so good. The fried taste of the spring rolls were reminiscent of the egg rolls I ate growing up. The glass noodles and mushrooms certainly made the dish but everything was intentionally combined for the perfect morsel of goodness. The cost of the spring rolls were CA $7.99 or $8.99. I would definitely order the spring rolls and the pad Thai again.
The place isn't that big and the line builds up pretty quickly. I advise going earlier in the primary meal times like 11/11:30am for lunch or 5 or 5:30pm for dinner. These times are ideals for those who do not like confined spaces or want to avoid crowds. If you don't mind, you may have to wait a fair amount of time before you get seated. The takeout line was pretty long too because it is a very popular place to eat. I also went with a friend that eats vegan and Pai demarcates vegan options on the menu. I thought that was a nice touch!
With over 2300 reviews at 4.5 stars, I can confirm that it is worth the hype. I'm not a huge fan of lines but if I pick a good time to go, I'll certainly go back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Francisco T.,"If we were not in the digital era I wouldn't have found this place, it's so unassuming from the outside. Yet once inside I was surprised to find such a packed restaurant, they even have a waiting area with tables and everything. Fortunately you can have drinks while you wait and they have some very good cocktails. So cocktail in hand we waited. Once on our table we got some crispy chicken as an appetizer, oh, it was so good. My main was a Panang curry that was a bit different from what I'm used to, but that it was delicious anyways. Really enjoyed this place and will be going back when I'm in Toronto again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,I-Lin L.,"Fun restaurant in Toronto that gets packed, so either come early to get a seat or make a reservation ahead of time online.  I wasn't able to make a reservation, but I was able to snag a table for dinner by coming by on a weeknight at 5:15 pm.  
The first time, I had Thai sangria, fried spring rolls, and green coconut curry with shrimp.  The food was delicious, and I loved how the curry was served in an actual coconut.  The sangria didn't taste very alcoholic though--more like a fruit punch.  
On my second visit, I had fresh coconut water and Chef Nuit pad thai with shrimp.  The coconut water looked kind of brownish and not clear, like the coconut water I had in California.  I wonder how long the coconut had been sitting out.  
The pad Thai was really good, with large pieces of shrimp.  At first, I thought they had skimped me on the shrimp, but then I realized all the large pieces were buried underneath the noodles.  Medium spicy wasn't too spicy for me to eat, and I don't like spicy food.  
You can choose the spice level only on some of the dishes, but I think the hottest isn't on par with true ""Thai hot"", so don't worry if you can't handle the heat, like me.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shajitha R.,"What can I say that hasn't been said before, other than just amazing food! Favourites were the Khao Soi and had to for sure try the mango sticky rice dessert!
Heads up though, ordered the mango juice and saw that they poured out a glass of rubican. Still a great drink, but just wasn't what I was expecting for $4.00.
Overall, AMAZING and I'll be back soon!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eliza K.,"Great food, love the ambiance of the location. Always receive excellent service. Always leave full and satisfied!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jayde L.,"I would firstly like to say that the food here was incredible. My partner and I got the gai satay to start, and gaeng massaman and chef nuit pad thai for mains. 
We came here two separate times, the first was so good that we revisited to order the same thing a few months later. 
The service was overall very nice, and the place is very big and usually busy. 
Unfortunately I could not give a five-star review and will probably not return because of the lack of attention to our stated food allergies. 
My partner has celiac and I am allergic to dairy. The dishes we ordered can be made without and I am in the habit of double checking with the server when they take the order and when they bring the food that the staff is aware of our allergies. Our food on our second visit clearly was not made without the allergens as we were severly sick afterwards. It's disappointing as I really did like the food. 
If you are allergen free I highly recommend this place, and to those with allergies-I hope your experience is not marred like mine!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina P.,"A friend recommended this restaurant and I would have waked right by otherwise. Down a flight of stairs, once you walk in, it's a cozy hub of bustling activity, feeling intimate, warm, and hip all at the same time. We had the Thai chicken wings, gai satay, moo ping, and spring rolls to start. The chicken wings were crispy with just enough sauce and the tamarind came through well - we ordered a second serving immediately after getting the first. We opted to dine family style, sharing the Khao Soi, Massaman curry, and the Chef Nuit Pad Thai. These dishes were all well-executed, with the typical flavours of lime, coconut milk, pepper, peanut, and tamarind balanced appropriately. Serving sizes were also great for a group of four to share and get a taste of everything. 
Service was quick, considering how incredibly busy it was for a Saturday night. Would certainly recommend making reservations in advance, as this place gets PACKED around dinnertime. Prices are only slightly higher than other Thai restaurants and on-par for the location and quality of food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rui T.,"Everyone who said I HAVE to come here when visiting Toronto was RIGHT! 
We got the beef pad Thai, the chefs Khao soi. The Khao soi is like a pumpkin coconut creamy curry with noodles! Both were extremely flavorful and DELICIOUS with such big servings for the price. These were so good that we ordered take out with the beef braised curry and another pad Thai. 
The spice levels aren't THAT bad actually. I would say average spice eaters could definitely handle mild/medium levels. 
The waiters were all friendly and accommodating! You HAVE to make a reservation the DAY before! It gets packed on the weekdays right at 5 PM. The winter dog drink was like a blue lemonade. Will miss this place SO much in America",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vicki G.,"Everything is Amazing - Ambience, Food , Service.  Typically a long wait but this place is worth every second.  Honestly I would wait hours for the Pad Thai but fortunately for me the wait was less than 45 minutes.   Really try this place, it is a gem!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Devi S.,Awesome food and the service is fantastic. Love the ambiance of the place with the records on the walls and classic rock being played,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vi L.,"Holy crap did Pai get even better?
The food was SO good, even better than I remember. Everything we ordered was A++. 
The Khao Soi was so deliciously flavourful I wanted to put my face into that bowl. I would've licked the bowl clean if it wasn't embarrassing to do so. 
Thai Spicy Pad Thai was super spicy but still super flavourful. Green Curry in a coconut makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The coconut bowl is a great touch because you get to carve the coconut flesh out as you liked. Yum! The red curry was really good too, but personal preference is almost always green curry.
The Sake bombs (4 point play) were super fun. I think Sake bombs were $5 on Saturday when we went. Beer was delicious. Thai Iced Tea was GREAT. 
Love it. Can't wait to go back. Worth the line up if you weren't fast enough to get reservations.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kirk B.,"This is a huge restaurant and it was quite busy during the time we visited despite it being mid-day. 
The service was lackluster, as it took awhile to be acknowledged by our waitress after we were seated.  Once she came by for drink orders it was awhile before the drinks came out and one was not included and had to be asked for again. Speaking of drinks, the Thai Ice Tea was fantastic! 
The food was superior to the service however, so it is definitely worth a visit if you are nearby.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,俊峰,A place with great experience. In the heart of the Toronto downtown. Food is delicious and restaurant setting is amazing. I do like it and will come back again.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linda V.,"Wait wasn't long and atmosphere was nice. Reasons I have to rate so low is I guess my high expectations for this place with the ratings here was over rated. The wings were great I won't lie very nice flavor, fried to perfection and presentation was even nice. Problem here is I figured I'd be getting a little more than 4 wings for 10 bucks and felt cheated, reason why I didn't I ordered the plate of stir fry with just vegetables. The stir fry was mediocre at best, I had a plate of veggies and it wasn't like it was fried or roasted or anything spectacular to cost me 17 bucks. I waited over 20 minutes for this plate of veggies got my wings before the veggies which was crazy. Overall I paid 35 dollars for 4 small but delicious chicken wings, a big ass plate of semi sautéed vegetables and a small bottle of sparkling water. Gotta say not what I expected. Not not edible just not enough of a place to run back to.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Josh A.,"I came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch with a friend because it was highly recommended to me by a local. I was told to order the khao soi and the pad gra prow, both of which came out super flavorful. This was my first time every trying these dishes, and I can confidently say that they've set a pretty high bar for the khao soi's and pad gra prow's I'll run into in the future. The khao soi had a heavy, rich soup base that flavored all the vegetables, noodles, and chicken that came with it. The Thai basil really shone through in the pad gra prow and had just the right amount of spice too. Portions were generous and prices were very affordable. Plus, the venue's great for a nice celebratory lunch or dinner out in the city!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alka V.,"Had heard lots about this place so were here with some friends for lunch 
Driving to downtown on a weekday and back and parking there was a real challenge 
Worth it though 
The lunch menu is really limited and so is the experience 
Wanted to order green curry within the green coconut but they said they didn't serve it for lunch
So lunch kills those wonderful options with some great food as really a limited menu 
Ordered Kung twist shrimp, wings and spring rolls for starters and with coconut water which was good 
Then ordered Tom yum soup which was super excellent to die for with great flavours Have never had such great Tom yum
For mains khow soi with shrimp was very good and Penang curry was just fine too
If you want a good experience here and a wide choice AVOID going here for lunch",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kaitlyn C.,"Our office loves the food here, however we had a terrible time ordering from this restaurant for our firm lunch yesterday. They don't answer the phones when they open at 11:30 - we tried 4-5 times before giving up and placing an order on uber. Then they cancelled our order because they couldn't do any of the appetizers we had ordered (and we weren't notified). By this time it was 12:15pm so I called again and finally got through and they told me to place it on uber again but that it wouldn't be ready for an hour. I asked if they could rush it as we had originally placed the order 30 minutes before, and thought it would be ready by 12:30pm. They said it could probably be ready in about 30 minutes. I placed the order again on uber with the items adjusted and uber estimated ready at 1pm. I went to the restaurant at 12:45pm as the woman on the phone said she'd try to have it ready by then. The order was ready - all except 2 items. These 2 items took a further 30 MINUTES to make as the rest of our food went cold (after 1pm as well). I asked the staff member there what was taking so long and he said that the kitchen was prioritizing seated guests over our order.... I think that was incredibly rude to say, especially as our original order was placed over an hour before then and I had been sitting waiting patiently for 15 minutes. I could also see other take out orders behind ours in the line being completed first. As I said, we love the food at this restaurant, but not when the service is like this and the food is left to go cold...",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Natalie V.,"Yummmmmm! This place is delicious! Came here on a Monday night, the parking is not great but there is a lot one block away for $10. The restaurant is quite large but we were lucky enough not to wait around 6pm. We were seated quickly and the service was great! They were attentive and got us drinks to start and kept refilling our water throughout dinner.
We order the green curry. It came in a coconut- we selected chicken with the bamboo shoots and it was tasty. Very flavorful, they even gave us the remaining curry in a separate bowl.
We had the crispy fish! There were two sauces that really added to the flavors and kept the fish crisp since it was on the side. The rice comes with fried shallots which were delicious!
The khoa soi was the last dish but my favorite! It was so flavorful with a really good kick. The egg noodles were done right and there were fried noodles as well. The beef was very tender!
Come and enjoy! You won't regret it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Benson L.,"Food was okay, if you are Asian and have tried different Thai restaurant, you probably only give 3 stars.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve M.,This was probably the best Thai I've ever had. Love the environment and the easy to order menu. Highly recommend for anyone into Thai to try this spot!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shelisa W.,"The wait is worth the wait. The hostess said it was going to be 1.5 hours at 7:30pm and they closed at 9pm. Well we got lucky, thanks to the hostess. Our anniversary dinner was amazing!! Pad Thai, soup, and egg rolls were delicious!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sally L.,The khao soi is great here. Lots of tables available but there's usually wait. Prices are reasonable and portions are decent,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Priyaan L.,"Visited Pai on a Friday night and had to wait an hour for a table. The quick service and warm ambience was incredibly welcoming. We started with the Shrimp Chips, they were perfectly seasoned and paired well the tamarind sauce. For mains we got Gaeng Hunglay with pork belly, shrimp Khao Suey, and the Green Curry. Both the curries were quite delicious. The Gang Hunglay was sweet, sour, and had a nice kick to it. The Khao Suey was disappointing and lacked flavour. Overall, it was a pretty decent meal and am looking forward to trying out other things on the menu.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rose T.,Sooo sooo good!!! Long lines but worth the wait!!!  We all loved it. Can't wait to try the other things on the menu!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joyce D.,"This place is very very busy. We had walked by around 6pm on a Thursday and the line was out the door just to see the hostess. So we went the next day for lunch, and it was still quite busy. It has very much a laid back hipster vibe. Your choice of seating range from bar style, shared communal, to individual tables. At that point, because it's so busy you kind of take what you can get.
It's a little bit on the pricier side for size portion to quality for its price. However, the dishes do come with great packs of flavor.
We ordered the Tom Yum soup, beef Thai fried rice, and shrimp Pad Thai.
Tom Yum was interesting with much more tang from the tamarind. It's sweeter with the sliced bell peppers and slice onions. It was a balance between your sweet, salty, sour.
Beef fried rice was good although the beef protein was not charred enough as served. 
Pad thai was great and the shrimp was very bold and meaty. The spice was great and it was unique to have it accompanied with a type of cabbage slaw to mix in.
Overall a nice place to try. Just some minor food qualms.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeff W.,"It's good. I think Pai is higher quality than your average Eat BKK and Thai Room. I do think that it is slightly overrated, the portions are not as big as other similar priced places, it's always crowded and the flavour is comparable to other pricier Thai places. 
Nothing mind blowing, but it's consistent and I know I'll have a good time here.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason N.,"The food was great, I would consider coming here again! I loved the energy, the service was awesome, there is definitely a nice charm about the place!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Phil K.,"Great Thai food!  Usually I am a pad Thai or Panang Curry kind of guy but I wanted to try something different. I had the Pad Gra Prow and I'm so glad I did. It was something totally different from my normal but so super tasty. If you've never had it, give it a try!
The service was wonderful. I wish I caught the name of my waitress as she was top notch.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelly P.,"Pai is worth the wait -- literally. 
Don't be scared off by the dinner line out the door! Pai had a trendy yet authentic atmosphere in a great location in the city for a weekend night out. 
I appreciate that the menu indicates which options can be made vegan or gluten free. I had Khao Soi with tofu instead of meat and no shrimp sauce. And the flavor and presentation was AMAZING. 
My friends had the oxtail dish which they said was well seasoned. The curry portions that come in the coconut may be smaller than what you are used to but it was a fun presentation with great flavor. 
I wish I was in town long enough to try more on the menu!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dani B.,This is the best Thai food I've ever had. The atmosphere is beautiful and everything I've tried on the menu is spectacular!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wesley K.,"Excellent Thai food that was worth the wait. Khao Soi was delicious, spring rolls were tasty, and the pad Thai was delicious. Would definitely come back!
Service was good and the entire vibe of the restaurant was fun with memorabilia all over.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel P.,"Pai continues to be one of my favourite restaurants in the city. Even if we can't enjoy the packed tables and fun ambiance inside the restaurant, takeout from Pai is one of the things that has kept me sane throughout the past few months.
My favourite thing to order (and I have ordered a lot) for takeout would be the Khao Soi. The noodles, broth and toppings are all packaged separately, to keep peak freshness. The portion size is great too, sometimes I even have enough extra broth for lunch the next day. I'll continue to come back for takeout until we can safely dine inside again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sammy T.,"This is the place that made me fall in love with Khao Soi. Everything here is good, but the Khao Soi shines brightly amongst the other dishes.
Everyone raves about their pad thai which I get but honestly, the kaho soi is where it's at in my opinion. I've gotten this during COVID-19 and they package everything very well- tight and with lids. The soup and noodles are separated so no worries about getting soggy noodles - i know that's a concern for me! 
That being said, this place is slighttttly on the expensive end but I think it's well worth it for the quality of the food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elaine C.,"After one failed attempt, we finally made it in to give Pai a try. The first time, it was lunchtime on a weekday and two sleeping toddlers in strollers. There was no ramp/elevator so we had to choose a different location if we wanted to have a peaceful lunch (which we did end up having elsewhere). 
We had tickets to the Royal Alexandra Theatre and thought that this would be the perfect time for a second attempt. As we passed by at 5:25pm, we noticed the line up already out the door. I ended up jumping out of the car while hubby went to look for parking. There's a line to get a buzzer and I was pleasantly surprised when I got to the host desk that it would only be a 15-20min wait. Although it looks small, the restaurant is actually quite large and can seat lots of people. 
We ended up eating about 20 minutes and was led to the back area. We passed a couple of ""traditional"" mat-on-floor type raised seating. The decor reminded me of a street food type setting. 
The menu is in Thai so I needed to read the translated explanations. When we were waiting I saw a bunch of mango sticky rices pass by so I knew I wanted to leave room for those. We bypassed the appies and got a Pad Thai (I wanted to compare with Royal Orchid and one in Grand Cayman which is so far the BEST tasting Pad Thai I've had), and a green curry with chicken served in a young coconut. We also got two iced teas. When I asked if they came pre-sweetened, I should've asked if the level of sweetness could be customized since other places typically make it too sweet for my liking. This one was just that. I'll have to ask next time around if we come back. 
We found that the wait was a bit long... over 15 minutes for the food to come out.  The Pad Thai was served with grated cabbage just like the Caymans so I was excited. The tamarind sauce was sweet, like Royal Orchid's but didn't have that savory flavour like the one in the Caymans (good thing we are going back! Can't wait!!!). So flavour was ok but the noodles were complete stuck together in a mass. Maybe too soft? Not enough oil?  I don't know. 
The green curry was nice and anything they couldn't fit into the coconut was served in a separate bowl. 
Mango sticky rice came nicely carved and on regular sticky rice. I've had ones served on purple sticky rice which gives it a nice texture. Flavour wise it was good but a bit skimpy on the mango. This dish was quite small for the $10 price tag. 
All-in-all, I'd say it's an average Thai restaurant. I wouldn't drive downtown and wait in line when I could have the same quality food uptown without lineups and free parking.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah W.,"I've heard a lot of people rave about this place and decided that it was prime time I tried it out.  I came here with my family on a Saturday early evening (around 5pm).  It's a quick walk from the Princess of Wales theatre, which was nice.  I was forewarned that it may be very busy and that there is usually a line outside the door.  I wasn't surprised.  about 9 steps of stairs takes you from the hostess to the door ... so in theory, 9 people in a single filed line before the line up is outside the door (not really a huge line up to me. That's like a party or 2 waiting for a table). 
The outside is very cute, the streets are quiet.   I may have waited maybe... 5 minutes before getting seated at a high table top that seats four comfortably.  Keep in mind though that these are bar stools, however they do have regular sized tables around. First impressions were that this was a very cute spot.  The smells were good too, fragrant. 
We ordered the Garbong (it was highly recommended), which was fried squash straws that came with a tamarind sweet chili sauce.  The sauce was delicious.  The garbong was ok. It's good for the first few bites but it gets really heavy afterwards.  We shared it amongst 3 people and by the time the mains came, we were stuffed. It was crisp though, so if you're looking for a healthy fries alternative, this would be it. 
Ordered the Kawahi special?  Some kind of cocktail named after an athlete. It was good - gin based. pineapple juice.  You don't taste the gin at all, so it went down real smooth... too smooth.
The thai milk tea was amazing - I would have had like 5 of them. Condensed milk with a good balance of tea flavour. 
The mains we ordered were the chicken green curry that was served inside a young coconut with a side of sauce, and a chicken pad thai.  
Green curry was amazing.  i had ordered the medium heat and barely felt anything - would probably order full on spice the next time. The flavours of coconut and curry were delicious and the plus was you can scrape the coconut meat out of the coconut. Delish!
The padthai was kind of a let down. I was hoping for the authentic flavours of a pad thai - which it was  and hoped that it would be mind blowing since it's the first thing on their mains menu.  It was that nice, sweet, tamarind like flavour rather than the fake orange stuff you get at food courts.  The only problem I had with this dish was that it was dry... so dry that I had opted to pour the curry sauce on top to make it more edible. Good pieces of chicken and what not though. 
This is a good place for thai.  i highly recommend the curry. oh. and the milk tea. GET THE MILK TEA!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adil E.,"The first place people recommend when you visit Toronto is always to come to Pai. Focusing on authentic Thai food and staying true to the warm nature of thai hospitality, Pai delivers on all fronts. The khao suey and the iconic Tom Yum Soup are worth the wait (dont forget to add shrimp to the soup for extra flavour). Honestly, you couldnt go wrong with anything on this menu. Also keep your eyes peeled for the Toronto Raptors frequenting this location post game",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Courtney C.,"Been wanting to come here for a very long time. This was my time here and I decided to try a bit of everything from the menu. The Khao soi was super flavourful and I love the crispy noodles that comes with it. The peanut sauce that comes with the satay skewered was also very delicious. I decided to splurge and got the lobster pad Thai, which is based on market price and only available on Fridays and Saturdays. On the day that I got it, it was going for $50. To my surprised, the lobster is exceptionally fresh and delicious and a decent size too. I actually think it's worth a try. It was definitely the highlight of the night. 5/5 for the lobster Pad Thai!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jocelyn W.,Great ambiance and amazing food. Consistent.  It's a popular spot so I would suggest making a reservation on the weekends.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Richmond O.,"Came here on a Wednesday at 1:30pm and to my surprise was this place busy. Line moved quickly but the line was still a 30 minute wait before getting seated. Was seated without water for 15 minutes before finally given water and the menu to browse through. 
Decided to order khao soi and gaeng masaman. Order took another 45 minutes before arriving at lukewarm temperature. Food tasted great but was disappointed with the temperature along with the portion size for the price that was being charged. 
Food was great but service was lacking.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ian B.,"Been here 4 times and each time is absolutely delicious.
Taste, portion sizes, beverages, vibe and wide selection are strengths.
It's generally always busy, but the place is huge and usually they can find you a spot (if you're just 2).
I love to bring friends here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chalita P.,"45-50 min wait from the door to the table to when the food arrived (Saturday evening). Slow wait to be seated and slow service. Therefore I'd advise coming here BEFORE you're in starvation mode. Once at the table the service was Not attentive - It took a while to get our drinks refilled. 
Beef Pad krapow- ordinary. Smaller plate in comparison to khao San road. 
Pad Thai - we ordered it spicy but it usually isn't. Spice works. The level ""Thai spicy"" is legit! Acceptable for those than can handle it. Yum!! They also accommodate and remove nuts if you're allergic. Definitely more fulfilling and more in terms of quantity than the first dish we ordered.
Based on the flavor of the food alone, this place has my vote. Good flavor, authentic Thai food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily G.,"This place was amazing. Right off the start, the atmosphere when you walk in and down the stairs is hard to ignore. It's very spacious, so walks in perfectly fine, especially if you don't mind sitting at the bars! My boyfriend and I, both when for the pad Thai, and were completely blown away. Hands down our favourite Thai spot in the city. Portions are great size and delicious !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fiona L.,"The place was okay, the food was not bad but it is definitely overrated. There was a huge line up at 4:45pm and they do not take reservations. We waited about 25-30 minutes for our table and the hostess told us that we would be seated quite shortly. Which obviously 25-30minutes was not a short wait, but it's fine as this restaurant was extremely hyped and popular. We got seated and ordered our food. We got the summer salad which was served immediately (probably 2minutes after we placed our order) but then the rest of our dishes came out exactly 36minutes later and it seemed as though this was a common occurrence as the table next to us was also waiting a long while for their food. It was hard to flag down a server to ask how long the wait was and once our food arrived it was not even hot. It was more warm. And it did taste good but not anything exceptional. 
I would say overall, this place is extremely overrated. It was definitely not worth the wait and not worth the price. $20 for one dish and it was not even hot and it took 36minutes to get to us. It was definitely more waiting than eating here.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Caroline L.,"I have been wanting to try Pai for years but have always been deterred by the long lines. Enabled by a friend with the patience of a saint, I finally got to try it earlier this year before shutdowns happened and I can confidently say that the hype for Pai is absolutely well-deserved. I'm partial towards Northern Thai cuisine and having tried over 40 Thai restaurants in Canada/US believe me when I say this is one of the better ones!
This is one of the BEST thai restaurants I've been to outside of Thailand and 
both dishes we got were cooked to perfection. I got the khao soi with braised beef and my friend got the gaeng kiaw wan with shrimp (green curry served with jasmine rice). Presentation was drool-worthy and portion sizes were huge (we both had enough left over for the next day's lunch). The flavors were so rich and fragrant with the combination of coconut milk curries and just the right amount of shrimp paste. I was genuinely impressed and can't wait to come back to try out more dishes.
During quarantine, I haven't ordered take-out from there myself but I've heard amazing things and strongly urge you to try this option out and support them if you're in a position to do so!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susan S.,Wonderful food flavourings with an extensive menu. Ambiance is rustic but works well for a casual dining experience.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hang T.,"Best pad thai ever! Packed full of flavors and dimension. That's what I really remember from this place. 
I got here right when it opened and there was already ten people waiting on a weekday. When you get there, the decor seems a little more hippie than Thai in my opinion. I was surprised that it was so dark in there, but I guess it makes it a fun atmosphere. 
My sister and I also ordered the pad gra prow and khao soi. The basil stir fry was moist and had a lot of basil flavor to it. The white rice balanced it very well. My least favorite dish was the khao soi. When we got it, the curry seemed lukewarm. I wasn't sure if that was normal, but I sent it back. It didn't taste appetizing. I enjoyed the noodles, but overall I'm not a fan of curry with carbs other than rice. 
The portions are big so if you want to try more than one dish, do community style. Service was great. I'd come back just for the pad thai.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Famous C.,The famous chef Thomas one day wanted Thai food and stopped here. Very good food with excellent flavor and good service. If in Toronto the famous chef Thomas recommends this place.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emma H.,"Heard this place topped Khao San Road, so it was decided for our NYE lunch spot. At 1:30pm it was a 10 min wait, but it got way busier after 2pm. The stairwell area was filled with people.  
Pai is a rustic place with a hip touch, with amber dimmed lights, wooden tables, painted artworks, tapestries, and a soul/r&b playlist. I like the picture wall telling the story of how Pai came to be. Be sure to check that out in the waiting area. There aren't a lot of servers so expect to wait a bit for the food and your check. 
With the place filled with so many people (lots of tables) already, the booming music wasn't really helpful in balancing out the chatter across the room. It gave us a headache and conversation was too muffled to be heard from across the table. 
Got the Tom Yum Soup (7$), Khao Soi (16.50$) and the Chef Nuit Pad Thai (15.50$). Portions for the entrees were fair, but the soup (small size) was tiny (altho the spiciness and flavour was awesome). See for yourself in the pictures. There is an option to upgrade to a large bowl (13$) which comes with rice, but that then becomes an entree. If only they had a medium size for people to share. 
Khao Soi has fresh egg noodles, golden curry, crispy noodles, coriander, green onions, choice of braised beef, chicken breast or chicken drumsticks. The drumsticks had shrimp paste so watch out if you have allergies. I got the chicken breast option. The crispy noodles were a good start to tasting this dish, but the curry itself did not appeal to my tastebuds. I wasn't sure what I was eating because the flavours seemed to conflict with one another. There were sweet and salty notes which clashed and so the curry did not shine through. Also, the chicken breast wasn't strips, it was more like frozen bits of chicken that were recooked - very dry and tasteless. The proportion of noodle vs chicken was off - I would have preferred more noods over the dry chicken pieces. 
Chef Nuit Pad Thai has stir fried rice noodles, house-made tamarind sauce, beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime, home roasted peanuts, choice of chicken, beef or tofu and veggies. My friend chose tofu and veggies, and medium spicy. There is also Farang Spicy for foreigners who can't tolerate much spice. Honestly I was eyeing the pad thai for the entire meal once I had tried a bit of it - so much more flavour explosion compared to my Khao Soi noods. The spiciness hits you at the back of the throat and warms up your system, and the seasoning makes you want to gulp down the next bite. Not sure bout the worthiness of the dish though, because the pad thai's had equal amounts of veggie - again, would've preferred more noods. 
Next time, I would probably get the soup entree alone next time since the large size = size of other entrees.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason Y.,"Pai is one of my go to restaurants in the city for quality Thai food. Their mango sticky rice is on point and their skewers are loaded with flavour. Would highly recommend! Key downside are the long wait times to get a table at the restaurant, but that speaks to the high demand of their food!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tara B.,Best Thai in the city. Authentic but innovative. Order anything on the menu. Great first date place as their cocktails are delicious,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lo C.,"I came to Pai on July 30 for a patio dinner.
Booking was a simple online process. 
SERVICE: 5/5
I was promptly seated upon arriving. The waiter was friendly and, most importantly, wearing his PPE properly. They kept a good distance away from me and my friend whenever approaching the table. Their kitchen staff COVID case was handled extremely well with 100% transparency. I am not worried but taking extra precautions myself to be more mindful. (I've also called Public Health and they told me this doesn't sound like I should be concerned but self-monitor for symptoms - which I don't have any). 
FOOD: 5/5
Pad Gra Prao: I get this medium heat with beef. I love the extra little kick to the food. It's always fresh & filling. 
Note: there's a lot of things that are missing from the menu - check before you come in to avoid disappointment!
Looking forward to when the restaurant reopens :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shefali B.,"I came here on a friday night in late November and was pretty impressed with how bust it was years later after it first opened. 
When I gave my name at the front, they asked me if our party would be ok sharing a table or being seated at the bar. ( to which we said yes to, because we were starvvving ) 
After about a 15min wait, our party of two was called up. They seated us at the bar, which actually was still pretty nice. 
We decided to start off with some cocktails and I got the Winter Dog Cocktail, which was a vodka based drink with peach schnapps , blue curacao & and lychee juice. It was pretty tasty! I would definitely recommend trying it. 
For my main, I went with the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Chicken, I originally opted for Medium Spice, but then decided to go with mild spicy, but wasn't sure if that would be enough. So they offered to bring some chili oil on the side to help spice it up. You can always add spice, but you can't really take it away.
Overall the drinks were good, the food was filling and tasty. The service was pretty good, especially on such a busy night, and the atmosphere was lively.  I would probably come back here if I was in the downtown core, but it's tough to say if I would come here again if I was coming from the outskirts of the GTA.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sirada P.,"Pretty authentic thai food in Toronto! Some dishes are a little too salty (the Tom Yum was too salty for me), but everything was quite delicious. Pai is well known and has gained a lot of probability in recent years and now reservations are pretty difficult to make! 
Not sure if the food if worth the line-up, but it is delicious. There are just other thai restaurants in the city that are just as delicious with no line.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Iksheeta S.,"The food here is really really great. I always get the khao soi! The service is also good, it gets really busy on weekends, but has never really impacted the service (for better or worse). The ambiance is just.. a typical cool Toronto restaurant. Mellow lighting, good music, lots of chatter!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M G.,"50 minute wait, but worth every minute! Visited while on vacation and tried the Pad Gra Prow with Chicken ---  enjoyed it so much that we had it again a couple of days later. Great flavor, a nice spice to it and really good service.",5

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Xin W.,"I like the Thai food in the PAI near the king street . There a lot of people who want to eat there, and we waited for about half an hour to get a table. The soup is very delicious, I like summer salad and grabong with dipping sauce.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marlene B.,"We love coming here. The food and service are great. We don't even mind waiting for a table. 
We love everything about Pai EXCEPT THE BACKGROUND NOISE. IT IS SO ANNOYING AND DEAFENING. 
How about some nice Asian music instead.?",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike H.,"PAI has been serving some of Toronto's best Thai food since I first dined here several years ago. There's always a crowd and party atmosphere in this basement restaurant that has vibes of a traditional northern Thai kitchen. I've had Chef Nuit's Pad Thai and Khao Soi before and all of our party raved about the food. On my most recent visit, there was still a line to be seated on a weekday afternoon.
This time I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with shrimp. After quite a wait, the dish arrived in an authentic metal plate (like one from my childhood). A perfectly cooked Thai style fried egg topped a bowl of rice with sauteed black tiger shrimps. The dish had plenty of Thai flavours but I was surprised at the small portion. The menu prices have also increased a bit with the popularity. Waitresses seemed a little too busy to regularly check in on all guests.
But if you're looking for a delicious Thai meal, PAI is one of the hotspots in town. I'm not surprised that Chef Nuit also started other popular places such as Khao San Road and Sukho Thai which also have overwhelming crowds. I recall the chef making a guest appearance on Masterchef Canada, so her good food is definitely not a secret.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ryan A.,"Holy popularity contest winner! 
I had heard the hype for this place, but once I arrived and witnessed the wait list, I knew the hype had to be for real. Thankfully it was a short wait for a single attendee (Phew!). The actual resturant is oddly tucked away in a multi level setup, which I entered in what could be determined as a second floor, but actually ground level? Either way, it's laid out well and the staff really know how to squeeze you into every nook and cranny. Phobia of tight spaces...likely not for you as there was not much wiggle room in the restaurant. The staff are on point though as busy as they were, constantly checking in with me to make sure if I had any questions or needed anything else, so bravo! Menu offers some typical Thai dishes, but they also go a little bit more into depth of the fantastic Thai cultural dishes that you rarely see in the Americas. Of course...I saw Khao Soi...my complete downfall. It did not take me long to grab the Khao Soi followed by a fresh coconut water, yes actually fresh, in the sense of being sliced open and served to you hull and all. So why four out of five stars? I can tell you the flavor of the food was not an issue, more so along the lines of portion. I was still hungry after an appetizer of a meal being the Khao Soi and being I spent over $16 dollars on it, I felt a tad cheated. Not a huge deal, but was not aware of the finger food portions they served or I would of ordered more initially. 
Still well worth it though!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen M.,"The food overall tasted good, but it is very oily. Also, go early if you can because it is always crowded. Service was ok.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Geena N.,"This is an amazing restaurant that I would highly recommend to anyone. All the cocktails are very unique and delicious, especially the tea Mac and the Lowry. The Khao Soi is the best coconut curry I've ever had. It was amazing with the shrimp. If you go to Pai you MUST try the Khao Soi. The pad Thai, oxtail curry, and pork skewers were also delicious.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jose R.,"Amazing food. Tasty and with great texture. It takes a bit of time when ordering it to go, but it is worth the wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer H.,"visited twice when visiting from Newmarket. The food was good quality, and the service was great. However the place was very loud and hard to talk with my friends, maybe need to ask for a quieter area next time. I recommend them!",3

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel R.,"HOLY COW! This was the best thai food I have ever had. Everything from the ambiance, the staff, the food was spectacular. I've had a lot of westernized Thai food in my lifetime and these dishes were the closest I've gotten to the quality of my sister-in-law's family cooking (from Thailand). When the Pad Gra Prow comes with a fried egg on top you know its legit. Looking at this photo my mouth is watering.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ben F.,A fabulous spot for authentic Northern Thai cuisine.  Considered one of the best in the city.  Be prepared to wait in line - especially on weekends.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela Y.,"One of Toronto's iconic Thai restaurants!
Had the 'Thai chicken wings' which were good, but needed the sweet tamarind sauce as the wings itself didnt have much flavor
The spring rolls are vegetarian, filled with mushrooms, glass noodles, carrots and sprouts. Unfortunately these came out dry, cold and not crispy. The filling wasn't exciting or flavorful at all.
For the mains we had the 'Pad Gra Prow' with holy basil fried with chicken and rice with a fried egg on top. This was a delicious dish, the only thing was the rice to meat ratio... too much rice!
The last main is probably one of the most Instagram popular. The 'khao soi' with fresh egg noodles in golden curry with beef was delicious. The flavors were not overpowering and salty. Will try it with chicken next time instead as the beef chunks were a bit too big for my liking!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fin R.,"Everything is excellent except the coconut drink is not really good. I ordered fried chicken wings, gaeng hunglay with porkbelly and khao pla tawt. I love all the food and the restaurant is very beautiful. Will definitely go again!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Delia D.,"Good food, BUT... long wait for a table (4pm on a Wednesday). We had no idea there was a 90 min turnover for tables (server brought bills and informed us at the 80 min mark). They don't take cash, unacceptable in my opinion. Our pregnant friend could not swivel the door of the toilet stall past her big belly & was forced to leave it open, regrettable design choice. 
Management could easily post signs in the entrance/waiting area that indicate their 90 min dining time and no cash policy, as a simple courtesy. Any place with prices this high should not be rushing you out of your seats as you try to order more drinks.",2

We must've just come in on the front end of the lunch rush, but our waters were always filled and the wait staff checked in with us to make sure all was well.
It's loud so if you're looking for a place to have a deep conversation this may not be the place, but it would be perfect for an awkward conversation you need to have in public or for a group because everyone has to yell a little to be heard.
I loved my green curry - perfect heat and coconut flavor.",5

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cherry L.,"I have visited this restaurant several times for lunch but had never came for dinner until now. Just like always, Pai never fails. The restaurant is always fun, vibrant and cozy, with friendly staff and long line ups! Their Thai food always impresses and you leave satisfied! Prices are reasonable and justified with the delicious dishes you get. You almost forget you are in Toronto.
We ordered the Grabong to start as recommended by our server. It's buttercup squash fries, kind of like next level sweet potato fries with a Thai spin on the dipping sauce. Then I got the Pad Gra Prow with ground pork for my main and my friend got the Khao Soi. I knew I was going to enjoy the Pad Gra Pow because I've had it before but what surprised me was their Khao Soi. It was better than all the other Khao Soi I have had in Toronto. My friend actually liked the Pad Gra Pow better so we should have switched! Nonetheless you can't go wrong with these signature dishes. Their Thai Milk Tea is also bomb.
Go check this place out! You won't regret it! On",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Drew D.,"Definite  5/5.  Great  experience. I  looked at the menu and yelled  ""Khao soi"" because I really just  had to pee. So I  went  to the bathroom  dropped  the kids off at the pool and ran out.  The  staff  was  friendly  as they chased me out of the restaurant. For some reason, it came over  me to yell out ""I don't like pineapple!""  Then  they  started yelling at me in another  language, I'm not sure  what it was,   sounded  a little like an  east asian  dialect. I just screamed ""no habla, no habla"" !!  Any hoots, 10/10  for the  washrooms: impeccable! the  printing on the menu was pretty  cool. I still have  to figure out  what khao soi is, but it sounds  delicious. By the way, I love pineapple, so I have no idea where that came from!  I must say, they have  a very enthusiastic staff!  The  whole experience was a great relief! FREE  PARKING!!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aasawari N.,"Will this review be number 2892 for Pai? That's quite a bit of reviews but it makes sense given how popular this place is in Toronto. I've had the pleasure of dining here twice. It's a must to go here if you like Thai food.
It's always busy, always. I've only ever come here with a reservation. The reservation ends up being at an early time for dinner, as those are what are mainly open. 
Seats are very close to each other, which likely won't be the case during COVID as for now, I'd expect this place to be takeout only. 
I have not had any of the drinks here but would love to try them in the future. 
The Chef Nuit Pad Thai and Green Curry were both delicious. I am a vegetarian and there were plenty of options.
Thanks for reading and don't forget to wear a mask!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cindy D.,"3.5 - People I knew really raved about this place and it gave me high expectations when we came here. Luckily we were seated right away despite it being a busy time. Service here was good but I found the food mediocre for me. Maybe it could have been since I have been having so much Thai food from one restaurant that I based my taste from them but the food here did not ""wow"" me. I am happy though to try this place as it has been on my bookmarks for years.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katherine A.,"Let's talk about Thai food!!
This local Toronto restaurant is worth the wait. Chances are if you didn't make reservations weeks in advance, you won't get one days before your visit... but THAT IS OK! 
I came here for a birthday dinner, because all of my friends have been raving about it and I felt it was time I try it myself!
So first things first:
- if you come for dinner and don't have reservations, chances are you're going to have to wait a decent amount. IT IS STILL WORTH IT.
- you will have to wait to get your number and put your name down, then wait for your number to get called. 
Ambience: underground vibe, crowded, full bar, good music and wooden decor 
Now the part you're most interested in... THE FOOD: 
- Thai iced milk tea: BOMB. I've had this before at other Thai restaurants, but this one was by far the best. You really taste the tea, aka richer in flavour. Bonus is they serve it in a larger glass! 
- Squash Frits: I honestly can't remember the actually name of this appetizer, but if you're with a group of 2+ you gotta try it. Comes with a peanut sauce that has a nice kick. What I loved most is how light this appetizer was, and of course the flavour.
- Green curry: I NEED TO COME BACK FOR THIS. I love eating out of fruits so if you're on the same boat, you'll love this. It's served in a coconut!!! Given that I am slowly building my spice tolerance (this may not even seem spicy to other people), I actually really enjoyed the kick it had to it. I ordered mine with chicken, but you have the option of veggie, tofu, and beef or shrimp for an extra $2. The flavour was insane!!! They really give you a lot of the protein you order with it, so you don't need to worry about not having enough. It comes with rice for you to pour the curry and meats on so it's easier to eat. I underestimated how much was in the coconut because there was still some curry left. 
All in all, I think I have officially hoped on the Thai food train and will find myself back here. 
If you can overlook the noisy crowds, long lines, and smaller walk areas - then I have no doubt you will find this place just as enjoyable!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alec M.,Amazing food and great atmosphere I highly recommend this as a must try been a few times and never disappointed,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dawn V.,"We stopped here for drinks before dinner reservations elsewhere and now planning to return for that good-looking food!
Bar/cocktail menu attached and everything looked good but my absolute fave was The Serge Protector!!! It's a little mezcal, a little Germaine, egg white, pepper... great combination!
If you're a fru-fru drinker, go with Summer Dog.. I was lured in my the fresh lychee, which was great but it's a very sweet cocktail.
We also tried the sangria with the red wine floater which was excellent.
If you have a group, get the sangria glass pitcher; the presentation with the wine floater is beautiful.
Very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient bar service.  Hip vibe and feels like a place you want to hang out.  Such a good find in a neighborhood full of more commercial feeling/theatre district bars/restaurants.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jackie M.,Great service fun atmosphere! The shrimp pad  Thai and pork satay were very tasty would love to come back next time we're in Toronto!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason C.,"Bold flavours and a electric atmosphere make Pai a go to if you're craving Thai in Toronto. The dishes are full of flavour and the pleasant heat that comes with Northern Thai food specifically. The beef curry that I had was rich without being overpowering, and the Tom Yum soup was just the right balance of sour and spicy. 
I would definitely recommend going, but be sure to either make a reservation or be prepared to wait in line for a table. I went on a random weekday night and still needed to call a few days in advance for a table for four",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,BerNard M.,food is always amazing there.loads of different dishes. pricing is amazing and portions sizes also,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Johnnie V.,Great food. Love that they expanded. Less wait. Great Thai tea. Would recommend for anyone visiting toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley D.,"Favourite spot to go to for Pai! Order the Khao Soi, you won't be disappointed. I also love the fritters, and the lychee sangria is prime",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Areeba Z.,"I have been here many many times in the past years. It is ALWAYS packed. I don't even bother with near-term reservations because I know there will be a long wait. If you go at a random time, or for an early dinner, there is ample space.
The food: I prefer going as a group because then you can order appetizers to share. The papaya salad is a great shareable option. I almost always get the Khao Soi (~$18). I have also tried the green curry in a coconut. Both are amazing. The serving sizes are on the larger size, but hey, who is complaining? The food is decently priced. The service is fast and most importantly, everything tastes amazing.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diana D.,"You can't go wrong with a place that has 1500+ 5star reviews. We came here after a friend who is local here recommended it. We stopped by on a Friday afternoon for lunch and it was pretty crowded. You can order drinks and appetizers while you are waiting though which is great and made the wait painless.
We ordered the eggrolls while we were waiting and to be honest I never thought I would write a review for an eggroll. This eggroll was definitely the best I have had so far; we liked it so much that we ordered a second plate of the appetizer. In addition, we got Penang curry and fried rice and both were great as well. 
Staff were super friendly and service was good.They don't do same day reservations though, so plan ahead because it does get super crowded.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tai D.,"This was probably one of the most delicious Thai places I've ever been to. Also, one of the best places I was able to eat at in Toronto. It was absolutely PACKED around 3pm. This just highlights how amazing the food is and people come here no matter what time of the day. We got the Thai fried rice, the panang beef curry and the pad thai. I could not tell you which I loved more because they were all soooooo amazing. I would highly recommend coming here if you are a fan of Thai food. The menu is  simple, but there are so many amazing dishes offered. The beef noodle soup appeared to be popular and I can't wait to go back to try it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ryleegirl L.,"I ordered the pad Thai and it was completely different from the downtown venue.  No where near as tasty 
But recently ordered in the green curry and it was delicious.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dan S.,"This is my favourite Thai restaurant, and I've been to many.  The ambiance is amazing, and the food is absolutely incredible.  I highly recommend the beef Massaman curry.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Du T.,"Finally had a chance to visit Pai after so long. The food still tastes as wonderful as it used to be. Of course we had to order the classic Tom yum and buttercup squash fritters along with Shrimp pad thai and our all time favourite ""Pad gra prow"". The service however might need some improvements, they were not attentive. We had to wait a good 10 mins to be served, not too happy about this!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Luis L.,Amazing food and great service. The Pad Gra Prow was my favorite plate by far. Highly recommended,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacqui L.,"Still as good as it was 5 years ago.
Pad Thai $18
Pad See Ew $18
Grabong $15.50
Thai iced tea $6
Sangria $11
Everything we got was cooked and made to perfection. Great service and food has been consistently on point. I think my favourite main dish is now the pad see ew. Damn that thick noodle just hits the spot!
Get the sangria, you won't regret this.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melanie B.,"Amazing food, atmosphere is so funky and authentic. And the staff are incredible attentive!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Charu G.,This is not based on my experience of food. They would not tell you how long is the wait time to be seated in the restaurant until you reach there. I called several times to check on the wait time as I didn't want to get into the hassle of finding a parking spot ( that area has construction going on) with a toddler. I told them I would reach in another 10 mins if that helps but they were adamant not to give out the information. I found it extremely unreasonable and unhelpful. I decided to eat elsewhere.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carina Y.,"Great food, and friendly service! The space was clean, and we had a lovely night out with friends here. Highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hallie T.,"O. M. G. This is THE best Thai food I have ever had. I was in town for a conference, and my friend and I received a recommendation for this restaurant. We happened to be in the area and walked by to see what the wait would be. It was an hour, but decided to wait. It was absolutely worth the wait. I'm from the US and have traveled a lot across the country, and always look for the ""best"" Thai food in every major city (New York, Chicago, etc.) The food at Pai blew all of my favorite spots out of the water. We ordered the papaya salad (which was the most delicious and beautiful papaya salad I've ever had--photo attached), beef pad Thai, and panang curry. All of our dishes came out quickly, were fresh, hot, and delicious. Spice levels were just right and the flavors were outstanding. This food was on another level. I highly recommend! I will return if I'm ever in Toronto again in the future. Thank you, Chef Nuit Regular!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sasha W.,"OMG this is the best Thai food I've had in Toronto! The Green Curry with shrimp is legit out of this world (medium spice), the shrimp are massive and very tender. I also got the Chef Nuit Pad Thai and while the dish was delicious, I found it a tad dry (I'm sure it was because it was delivery), but then I threw some green curry sauce on it and it was a game changer! 
I ordered through Uber Eats, so I can't speak to what the restaurant or service is like- but oh my god the food is fantastic. Fresh ingredients, generous portions and really flavourful. 
I will definitely try dining in soon and update my review .",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tani S.,"We were a bit concerned seeing the long line at 8 pm on a weekday night but so relieved we stayed through the line since have never had such a delightful meal!  
Yes the atmosphere was a little bit on the loud side but the friendly service and the food more than make up for it.  We loved the high tables with stools and the veggie spring rolls were delicious.  
We ordered Gaeng hunglay with oxtail (a delicious oxtail stew reminiscent of an Indian curry), khao pad thamada (a Thai style fried rice), chef nult Phad Thai, and khao pla tawt (basa fish).  I appreciate that you could customize the spice level of each dish and even though we got everything mild it was still so flavorful!  All were wonderful but the oxtail was our favorite, shocked at the tenderness and uniqueness of that dish.  
I wish that we lived closer since would frequent this spot more often...  I'll dream for now until the next time I'm back in Toronto to visit :).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristen P.,"Went on a Sunday night and there was already a line. We got a table for two within five minutes. For a Thai restaurant, I would have to say this place has an unusual ambience -- it's dimly lit with popular North American songs blasting on speakers throughout the restaurant, and can be quite loud. There is also a full bar here if that's your thing.
All in all, the food was great. The Gaeng Kiaw Wan 'In a Coconut' is a green curry dish served with rice and extra green curry in a bowl on the side (the waiter said it was because it can't all fit in the coconut). It is a dish more on the spicy side, but I would say it's still manageable. The coconut really gives this dish some character, and you can also scoop out some coconut meat with your spoon to eat as well. You can choose between chicken, beef, dish, or tofu & veggies.
Khao Soi is also a curry dish but it is a coconut curry dish. It is more sweet than spicy but still has a kick of spice to it. I like the combination of egg noodles and crunchy noodles. We got braised beef chunks (like the ones you put in beef stew), but you can choose between chicken or beef. I thought this dish might be overhyped when I was reading Yelp reviews prior to coming here, but it really is worth the hype.
Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to have Thai food in Toronto. I'll definitely be back again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa C.,"Came here for the second time and really enjoyed my experience yet again. 
Once we got a number, we were directed to the bar to enjoy a drink or two while we wait inside the restaurant for them to buzz our number. During our wait, we ordered Tom Yum Caesar and Thai Mojito. Tom yum Caesar felt really strange at first, as it felt like cold tom yum soup with alcohol, but slowly became addicting. 
 
When we finally got seated after about 20 to 30 minutes, we ordered:
1- Miang Kung - various ingredients wrapped in betel leaf (really different than what I had tried before, it felt really refreshing...if you'd like a cold dish for appetizer, I'd recommend this dish. It's great that you can control your flavour to your liking as well
2- Tom yum kung - large pot of tom yum soup with large shrimps, served with a bowl of white rice (it's a good portion to share between 2 people, a lot of soup)
3- Pad gra prow - basil stir fried with our selection (tofu) ... also a tasty dish, but became really spicy
Overall, I had really enjoyed the environment, except that it was unfortunate that the fire alarm went off and we were beside it, so a few tables around us including us rushed through dinner and left. Not sure what happened, but hopefully that won't happen again!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivien K.,If you want the best Tom Yum soup of your life then come here !! I've had a lot of Tom Yum soups in my life and I have to say this puts it at the top of my list for me . So much flavor and done correctly ! It gets pretty busy in here so get ready to wait a few but it's totally worth it ! I ended up getting the Khao soi for lunch . The flavor was good but it came out lukewarm . The braised beef was pretty tender . I didn't care TOO much about this dish . The fiancé got the rice ground beef dish . That was AMAZING !! Loved it so much . I thought that was better than my Khao Soi dish . Service was very attentive . Got my food out right away while it was pretty much packed inside the bar . Also - the bathrooms are really clean !!!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melinda E.,"This is a warm & cozy buzzing, basement level restaurant, with a cocktail
menu so delicious that you'll wish they were open past 10:30pm.
The food is generously portioned, delicious, and reasonably priced. Be prepared to wait for a table, they have a side room with benches and tables.  
My companion had a veggie Thai meal that was served in a carved coconut.
 I was thrilled with the amazing rice noodle beef soup.  Our cocktails (a plum wine mule and a cool sake were excellent.
Definitely want to return.  Staff was incredibly friendly, welcoming, and have a rule to never rush folks out at closing time.  Photos below.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James M.,If you like Thai food and you are downtown Toronto this is the place to be.  It is busy but the food is fantastic.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara E.,"THIS PLACE WAS SOOOOO GOOD! I was in Toronto for a women's conference and my friend and I decided to check this place out for dinner. We were promptly seated and given menus. She's a vegetarian and they had really nice options to choose from. I went with the pad Thai. We got our food and holy portions! I ate mine for dinner, a later meal before bed, then STILL had some left for the next day. My friend got the soup and also got 2 meals out of it. Service was great, location was great and priced very reasonable for downtown Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edwin G.,"Hands down the best Thai restaurant in TO. There is always a line up to get in but worth the wait. 
Love the decor and the vibe. 
For starters we had the Garbong (squash fritters), along with Miang Kung. For the main, we had Khao Soi and 
Laap Salad. You can really taste the ingredients with every bite. We loved the food and the atmosphere 
The service made it even more pleasurable. Our waiter and the helpers where all pleasant and made sure we where ok at all times. I highly recommend this restaurant to my family and friends, you won't be disappointed 
The only thing I would recommend is to book a reservation  prior, the line up to wait is really long if you don't reserve",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karen S.,PAI's pad kra pao and pad see ew are a MUST. They're always delicious! One of the best authentic Thai foods in town hands down.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lucy K.,"One of the best Thai food in the town! Since I tried this place like 6 years ago, I've been their regulars like many others. Always super busy but food comes out in timely manner. Highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Larie L.,"I've been here numerous times and contemplating of adding more to the more than 1000 glowing reviews but I just feel I need to have a say in this restaurant too.
4 words for you - YOU SHOULD EAT HERE!
If you love good FOOD especially Thai cuisine then seriously by all means you should try PAI. I've taken more than 100 people in this restaurant including out-of-towners and recommended to families and friends. And every time they come back to thank me for introducing them to Pai.
If you're ever going to order something here, that should be the Khao Soi. 
Rich and creamy and packed with flavour from the slew of aromatics combine with tender braised beef, this is my fave dish and the one I normally order here. 
If you want a unique cold beverage, you should try their Thai iced tea. This sweet, creamy beverage is very popular in Thailand and Pai's version is so refreshing and not so sweet. 
Another dish I enjoy ordering is the Thai Fried Rice. The subtle taste of fish sauce blends nicely with the other ingredients which makes it so delish!
The restaurant ambiance is also homey and cosy and they have this one area where diners sit on cushions. Everyone from the hostess to the servers are very nice and friendly.
I would have given 5 stars but noticed that the portions have gotten smaller. Nevertheless this is still one of my fave Toronto restaurant.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melvin M.,Excellent food. Efficient customer service. Meal prices were reasonable. Will visit again. The ambiance was nothing exceptional. Very noisy.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pat C.,"Came here on Saturday at 1145 and a line has already started forming so come early! Waitress was very friendly and attentive. The best dish for me was the shrimp miang kum. Definitely a must! I'm surprised they have this here as it's a very niche thai dish - will definitely return for more! The platter is alright, I like the moo ping (pork skewers) the most. The laab (minced pork) tasted kinda soapy (?) Which is weird I'm not sure why but I didn't enjoy it too much. The fritters were crunchy and fun to eat. Last the beef salad was okay. It was a little dry, I wish there was more sauce or dressing because the dressing is really good. All in all it was very good and I would definitely come back to try the rest!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason M.,"The ambience and hum of hungry diners on a cold Toronto night really set the tone for a terrific evening. I could tell the servers were proud of the cuisine coming from the kitchen and the various Thailand scents that permeated the restaurant did not disappoint!
Be ready for a wait if you want to walk in during prime dining hours, but the venue is expansive. What looks like a quaint location rapidly expands into quite the venue upon being summoned by the hostess and led to a table. It'll be close quarters with you fellow patrons but by no means claustrophobic.
 I selected the following: PAD GRA PROW (holy basil stir fried with your choice of ground pork, chicken, beef or tofu, steamed jasmine rice, thai style fried egg, nam price nam pla sauce). Downright delicious with really well executed crispy pork. The medium heat level as requested wasn't that hot and really let the other flavors of the dish shine through. It was slightly small portion than I was hoping but all-in-all, a terrific experience.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bebita F.,"First time at this restaurant.
Had heard from many people that is a must try place and it definitely did not disappoint. From the moment we walked in we were greeted and accommodated by all staff. They were very knowledgeable about their food and made great suggestions. But I cannnot say enough about the food.....wow soooo delicious  I would go back again and again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brittany I.,"Pai pai pai! I would definitely recommend this joint. Pai has been on my hit list for quite some time now. When I finally had the chance to go, I took it! The experience was pretty good. Just what I expected. 
I ordered their khao soi and their mojito. The khao soi is a peanut based sauce/noodle soup. I usually get it with beef. It's amazing. Yum! Loved it. The flavours are very strong, not overpowering but hearty. Definitely worth it. Even tho it's a little pricey, it's worth it. I don't give a lot of 5s out, but for what it's worth, I enjoyed it. 
Definitely coming back to try more!! Try to reserve or come in early! 
$$ -15-25ish",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patricia J.,"I mostly order khao soi from thai places. The one here is solid. Great broth flavour. I got the veggie with tofu. Still prefer the liberal ingredients used in the khao soi at Sukothai on Wellington  ( more green onion, cilantro , lime and option to increase level of spice ) but Pai's version isn't far off. Will order again in the future.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erika G.,"Back in 2016 I took a trip of a lifetime and one of the destinations was Thailand. I have been dreaming of the flavours that I experienced there ever since. If you're like me, forever seeking truly authentic memories of Thailand, look no further than the Entertainment District's PAI. NOW Toronto voted them as the #1 Best Thai Restaurant 2018, they're featured in the Day of Gluttony: 24 Toronto Restaurants in 24 Hours video, and blogTO has named them #1 Best Thai Restaurant and #1 Best Pad Thai in Toronto. Reservations are highly recommended as this restaurant is regularly lined up out the door.
Executive Chef and Owner Nuit Regular is from Northern Thailand herself and opened her very first restaurant in a town called Pai (northwest of Chaing Mai). After moving to Canada her goal was to bring the distinct flavour of Northern Thai cuisine to Toronto. She now owns a family of four different Thai restaurants in the city but considers PAI her home. You'll recognize the restaurant right away from its ""highway signage,"" letting you know that you are about to enter the correct place: Thai food heaven.
As you descend the stairs into Chef Nuit's subterranean Thai lair, the vibe feels extremely laid-back and unpretentious. It's as if you've stumbled upon some kind of secret basement - except that everyone is well aware of how good they are and it's no secret at all. This place isn't ""traditional"" Thailand in decor, not even close. It's more of a modern, young hippy's take on Thai, with beams and brick walls, twinkling string lights, and pictures of musicians and street signs as artistic pieces. The ambiance is the fun side of Thailand, captured in restaurant form. The dining room is always packed and busy. It's noisy and plates of food are constantly passing by... And the best thing for you to do is to jump in and hold on for the ride.
The staff is friendly (but busy) and after a short wait we were seated at our table with the room's activity unfolding around us. I ordered a Thai Iced Tea ($5.75), my favourite thing to drink. I loved the fact that they also do Thai buckets (complete with rum, Red Bull, and coke) but since I didn't want to die that night, I abstained. On the other hand, I was disappointed that Chang is not present on their beer list. Regardless, my Thai iced tea took me straight back to the hot, hot days that I spent in Thailand, constantly consuming this beverage in an attempt to cool off. Strong black tea paired with the sweetness of condensed milk is never wrong.
Thai food involves complex layers of flavour and sophisticated balances; spicy, sour, a little bitter, salty, herby. Colour and texture are important; crispy, soft, cold, hot. This interplay between elements is what makes Thai food so thrilling and addictive. The best Thai restaurants in Canada are the ones that truly honour these intricacies and offer an authentic dining experience. There are a lot of Thai restaurants. There are far fewer good Thai restaurants. PAI is one of them (along with Maenam in Vancouver).
The menu at PAI involves six different sections, none of which are overwhelmed with too many dishes. The menu is paired down to exactly the right offerings, showcasing exactly what is best. The group that I was dining with was ready for a feast!
We started with the Som Tum Tad 'Papaya Salad' with Dried Shrimp (Shredded green papaya, tomato, long green beans, garlic, red chili, tamarind juice, long leaf coriander, coconut sugar and freshly squeezed lime. Served with pork rinds and shrimp chips - $14.00). The presentation of this gorgeous platter set the tone for the rest of the meal and built excitement for what was to come. I loved the crisp freshness of this salad. Most of all, I appreciated the zesty spice of the dressing used. The best papaya salad that I ever tasted was at a night market in Krabi, and it was exceptional in large part due to the punchy dressing that the salad was bathed in. The version at PAI is by far the closest that I have come to tasting anything else like it. I enjoyed the addition of texture with the crunchy and playful pork rinds and shrimp chips. An ideal way to begin a meal.
Once the salad was finished the rest of our feast arrived all at once. Our table was an eclectic array of bowls, dishes, platters, all being passed from hand to hand. Colours danced across the table and tantalizing aromas beckoned us to dig in.
From the Stir Fry section we obviously had to try Chef Nuit Pad Thai (Stir fried rice noodle in a homemade tamarind sauce with bean sprouts, tofu, egg, chives, long leaf coriander, shredded cabbage, fresh lime and house roasted peanuts - $16.50), known as the best pad thai in the city. You also get to select whether you would like your pad thai made with chicken, beef, tofu & veggies, or shrimp. I chose the tofu & veggies because our other dishes contained either chicken or beef. When asked about which spice level we wanted, I chose medium. Pad thai is such a standard dish in every Thai",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Liz G.,"Make a reservation! This place is Hot crazy busy!  There were long lines of ppl waiting for tables as we were leaving. I do have to say it is worth the wait.  Because it is located downtown expect traffic.  And getting into a garage for parking is kind of a pain, but once the food arrived we forgot about the stresses of getting there on time. 
The food is very authentic and true to form. It's not often you can say that when it comes to Thai food. It was just insanely tasty.  So good in fact we ordered food to go, since we knew we wouldn't be returning.  The pad Thai for breakfast was still phenomenal by the way. 
Expect nothing but exceptional flavors.  Our service was good, I do feel it could be a little better but given they were jam packed and there wasn't an empty seat anywhere in the restaurant it's understandable.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kel B.,Solid place for takeout but the restaurant itself isn't good for dates or anything more than getting a quick bite.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kseniya V.,"This place is absolute heaven for Thai cuisine inthusiasts. All of the dishes are absolutely delectable, and crafted perfectly. The squash fritters are a must and so is the tom yum soup. Frankly, everything else is equally as delightful. Please visit this space if you ever get the chance. Do not be intimidated by the line ups as there are no reservations at PAI. However, lineups move very quickly and the experience following is beyond worthy. 
P.S no photos of the food were taken simply because it was too delectable for me to occur to pick up the phone.
11/10
P.P.S service is lovely and the atmosphere is transporting.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steven M.,A great place.  My family felt tight at home. The service was exceptional and the price was reasonable. If you Uber it might take longer than quoted.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ryan L.,"Just went here for lunch.    Amazing food and great service.   Get here early or make sure to have a reservation, because this place gets busy (and for good reason).
Had the green curry with fish.   For $16 you get a ton of food.   Got about 5 pieces of delicious fish (Basa though, but I like the taste of Basa).   The fish is not over battered in its panko crust.    Fried to perfection and very juicy.  The curry sauce is so good which is served on the side.   I dipped the fish and poured some on my rice.   
Have to go back to try the Khao soi next time.   Can't wait to go back",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna V.,"Excellent food, interesting venue, great service. Highly recommended. The food seems to be from a different region than we're used to so I'm glad we tried something new.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa X.,"We tried this place couple of times during our trip to eastern Canada from California due to the rave yelp reviews.  Our first time we only had the northern platter which was very good.  It consisted of the Thai sausage, pork laab and skewers and the grabong squash fritter.  That was my first time having the fritter and I enjoyed it very much.  They were out of some food during that night.  
The second time, we had the plah nua, summer salad, shrimp Tom yum soup and again the grabong fritter with a couple of sticky rice.  The soup was good.  I thought the summer salad was quite tart so only took a couple of bites.  They also ran out of some menu items when we were there at 7 pm.  It doesn't seem like they offer any spice as the laab and plah nua had no Thai chilies in it, unusual for Thai food.  We did ask for fresh, raw Thai chilies to eat on the side to add some heat to the dishes.  
Service was ok, seems to be understaffed for a busy place.  
4 stars as I can't stand it when restaurants are unprepared and run out of food.  Both nights we were there, they ran out of the coconut ice cream.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kareen N.,"Hm... I'm gonna try coming back here to get the full experience but for now I'm just going to comment on the food because I've only ever gotten takeout.
I've only ever tried the Pad Thai here and you know what I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it. It checks off everything I want in a Pad Thai and this is the safest bet you'll get in Toronto. The only reason why I wouldn't give it five stars is cause I'm not particularly wowed by anything, if anything I feel every other Pad Thai place is like below standard and this one is the standard. 
My boyfriend also tried the green curry and he seemed to really like it. I tried a bite and it was quite refreshing and coconut-y but very filling. 
Can't wait to try this in house someday!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,K K.,"Best Pad Thai I've had in my life. They make most things vegan. Kind of expensive though- $18 for a Pad Thai and $11 for an order of 3 (tasty) egg rolls? ($CAD). Can probably find cheaper, but you're wanting the best, Pai is it. Very friendly waitstaff that anticipate your needs (more chili sauce? looks like you need more water?). Easy to get a table when I went, but I'm told it's sometimes difficult -- really worth it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clement R.,"So my coworkers and I decided to make a visit to Pai to get some authentic Thai food as the food choices around my office is bad. It is quite a walk from my office to Pai. But we ordered ahead through Ritual and it is hassle free. 
I ordered the Thai Fried Rice and this is so good that I was like WOW! Added some fish sauce and the lime. WOW! The flavour just kicked up a notch. The only comment I had is after a bit of a walk back to the office, the rice became a bit soggy. So not really anyone's fault. Just how takeouts are. So my experience with the rice is still good, just minus the sogginess. I am coming back again either for lunch or take out. And yes, I must try the curry. 
I do have a comment regarding the restaurant. So when I got in, I felt the air was a bit stuffy. So I felt a bit disoriented. Just a thought.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diane C.,My husband and I were visiting Toronto and came here after reading the reviews. Pai did not disappoint! We had to wait for a table for close to an hour but it's okay since we didn't make a reservation. The service was great from start to finish. Everything we ordered was very tasty! Great vibes too. Would definitely come back the next time we are in town.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zoejaiwah F.,"This place is busy busy busy, I'm pretty sure they take reservations so take advantage of that if possible.
The food is surreal, tried so many of their menu offerings, with all coming out on top! The environment and service was amazing as well. Vibrant atmosphere, amazing food and service can't be bet!
Visit if you fancy a loud restaurant with amazing food to follow.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelly F.,"This is a super cool Thai spot in Toronto. Someone recommended this place to my friend and I and I'm glad we tried it! 
The line tends to always be out the door as other reviewers mentioned, but they really do a great job of moving people through quickly; we didn't have to wait long to get a table. The restaurant itself is underground, so it has this kind of dark and cozy vibe going for it. Some of the tables are pretty close together, but service is quick so you won't be in a small space for long! 
We ordered beef pad thai and chicken fried rice to share. Unfortunately when the dishes came they were both made with chicken, but by that point we were so hungry that we didn't care and just scarfed everything down rather than complaining! Both the pad thai and fried rice were fantastic and reasonably priced for downtown Toronto. The portion sizes are perfect for sharing, so you can order a few plates and try different options. I don't have a lot of experience with Thai food personally, but I could tell that this was an impressive place and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. 
Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aaron T.,"So I've been hearing rave reviews on Pai Northern Thai Kitchen from many people and here on Yelp so obviously this guy had to try, My wife and I did try their sister restaurant Sabai Sabai Kitchen and Bar down on Bloor street a while back and loved it. So they are located near Duncan and Adelaide near the Princess of Whales Theatre. They are located on the lower level and I didn't notice any ramps or elevators but I could be wrong. 
The interior of the restaurant is really deceiving because at first I though it was small and once inside on their floor wow was it big, we got there around 11:40 on a Tuesday and it was not that busy yet. The decor I really like it felt like I was on a street in Thailand having lunch. Right when the clock struck noon bam they got hit with waves of people and it felt like it was a Friday night at your local bar full of energy and hungry patrons. For those of you who missed out on getting a table they also have a market for take away so don't feel left out. 
My wife and I ordered quite a bit just for the two of us since it was our first time here we ate with our eyes first and rolled up the stairs later. We ordered a Papaya salad in Thai spice level and the Kung Tawt which is the fried black garlic shrimp with a tangy Thai dipping sauce. The papaya salad was made with super fresh ingredients served with crispy shrimp chips, pork rinds, rice noodles and some sliced cabbage. This salad can be made to order on the level of heat you want however I found that even the Thai spicy wasn't bad but I do eat fairly spicy so be careful. The Kung Tawt comes with 6 pieces of large prawns deep fried until golden very crispy and fresh as well. 
As for the star of the show we ordered the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle soup and Fried Basa Fish with green curry served with rice. The noodle soup was nice with tender beef chunks, topped with fresh bean sprouts and a couple of fried crispy wonton skin and the soup was delicious but I found it slightly on the salty side but overall very good. The deep fried crispy basa fish came with 4 sizable filet portions with a side of green curry made mild spice and a bowl of white jasmine rice. The filet's were crunchy but juicy on the inside dip it in the curry sauce and a spoonful of rice mmmm delicious. I did wish that the curry we can choose the spice level as well because to me the curry was weak in the spice department for me and even when I added 2 dishes of the hot chili oil it was ok just a bit of tingle for me. 
Despite how busy they get during their lunch rush our server was on her toes, I noticed she kept all her tables she was waiting on with everything we need from water topped up or a new can of beer. everyone here is super friendly.
Can't wait to visit again.
Fei Jai out!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angie Y.,"This place was so good!! We had to wait about half an hour but it was so worth it! I ordered the tea mac and the khao soi with chicken drumsticks. The drink was also really good, I mean its just thai iced tea with alcohol, how could you go wrong??? The soup was really amazing though. The crunchy fried cracker(?) on top was yummy dipped in the sauce and the chicken was super tender and fell off the bone. The noodles also had a great texture but what really made the dish was the sauce. The sauce was just the right amount of sweet, salty, spicy, and creamy... truly chefs kiss. If I could, I would have taken the sauce home and eaten it with rice for like a week.... I still think about this dish and it's been a while since I went...",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cecilia L.,"Tastey food but not all seating is pleasant 
Sometimes sitting in the back feels pretty isolated from the restaurant.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew L.,"I give this restaurant four stars. I have eaten food at Pai twice, most recently in late November 2019.
Pai is a trendy Thai restaurant located in downtown Toronto. It is one of the most popular spots in the city so you need to make a reservation in advance. It is busy and loud, and constantly has hip hop and pop music playing in the background. The majority of the guests are millennials so it might not be the best place for everyone.
The food is very good and very filling. I always order too much which is okay as the leftovers (excluding anything crispy) tend to travel well. There are a lot of menu options and you can't really go wrong with anything.
Highly recommended. I will be back soon. Four stars.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arjun C.,Thai food. Check. Great taste. Check. Good quality ingredients. Check. Good ambience. Check. The fact that you need to wait for a little minute to get food here shows how much the people love this popular Thai place. Highly recommend if you like Thai cuisine.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tiffany T.,"The food was amazing! I would definitely come here again to try other things on the menu. We had two dishes, Khao Soi and Pad Thai. 
The Khao Soi was very flavourful. It was savoury, creamy, and light. The beef was very tender and the noodles light and chewy. Both tasted amazing when coated with the curry. 
The Pad Thai had many ingredients and flavours that balanced well together and reminded me of the Pad Thai you can get in the streets of Thailand. I liked that they put the peanuts on the side so you could mix in as much or as little as you wanted.
The staff was very kind and pleasant to talk with. They made you feel very welcome which I really appreciated. 
The atmosphere was very relaxing and bustling with people. It was very busy but very comfortable with the Thailand decor. 
They ask have many vegetarian options, so I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Masaru O.,"I'm really not sure why this place has such great reviews, I found the food merely average. The interior reminds me more of the Southeast Asia budget ""backpacker"" vibe, ie partiers. It's certainly a part of the Thai experience but not really my thing.
Tom yum soup - this was pretty solid with vibrant flavors and a good kick. Maybe I've really lost spice tolerance but I was starting to drip before I was done with the cup...
Pad cha hett - mushroom stir fry. I got this with black rice just to try something new and it didn't quite fit the rest of the dish. If you get this, stick with the jasmine. The stir fry part was disappointingly bland though. It had a bit of a fennel taste to it, not sure what that comes from.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ngoc P.,"Delicious food and friendly staff
Nice vibe, Good decoration
Reasonable price
Very busy tho, better to make reservation!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Geoff M.,"Some of the best Pad See Ew I've ever had. Service was great, prices were fair, busy place (which makes sense given the quality). Would highly recommend! 5/5 stars",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Farah Z.,Pai consistently offers great quality and taste at both their locations! And on top of that they also offer halal options! The only thing with Tyler downtown location is that their service is sometimes great- sometimes not.. depends on who ur server is! Hence the one star less!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Luke L.,"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is one of the most popular Thai restaurants in Toronto and the restaurant won few awards from the NOW Magazine (2014 ~ 2016 Readers' Choice Runner-Up). Chef Nuit Regular also own three other sister restaurants (Sukho Thai, Kiin, and Sabai Sabai).
Parking is not fun in downtorn Toronto, but I managed to find a lot about 4~5 blocks away. Our party got here at 6:45 PM and the hostess said the waiting time is approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour. I put my number down so that they can text me when our table is ready, but I started to get a bit anxious because I wasn't too sure whether I would actually get a text via data roaming (using US number in Canada) and my friend had delayed texts during this Toronto trip. Luckily one of my friends was able to utilize his unparalleled soft skill by talking to the hostess after we waiting about 30 minutes and somehow he was able to get our party a table immediately afterward.
The menu selection reminds me a lot of Pok Pok (a very popular Thai restaurant in Portland). You will find mostly Norther Thai cuisine and no pad see ew is on the menu (I didn't even notice until one of my friends mentioned about it). I still somewhat questioned why one of my friends ordered Pad Thai when that's not even on one of Yelp's highlights, oh well.
***
Grabong (freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters lightly coated in red curry paste batter, deep fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with nuts - CAD $13): Squash fritters were lightly fried and they didn't even taste like squash (more like sweet potato). Oh man that sweet and spicy dipping sauce tasted extremely addicting. This is a must order dish.
Pad Gra Prow with Crispy Pork (Moo Grob) (holy basil stir fried served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a Thai style fried egg + nam prik nam pla sauce [fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime] - medium spicy, CAD $17.5): WARNING - If you don't like fish sauce, then you will NOT like this dish. Luckily I like fish sauce and this rice dish tasted a bit like a Thai version of Taiwanese minced pork rice with an egg. Medium spicy wasn't very spicy. It was a very delicious dish and I also recommend this dish too!
Thai Iced Tea (CAD $5.50): Maybe I was pretty thirsty, but that was one good Thai tea. I probably finished the drink in less than 1 minutes.
***
EXCELLENT Thai food - good enough to compete against some of my favorite Thai restaurants in Los Angeles (e.g. Daisy Mint in Pasadena, CA). I wouldn't mind waiting for a hour if I am coming back here again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,P K.,"Amazing, from start to end, just expect a wait time but food was worth the wait. Will come back when we visit Toronto in future again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeana P.,"Long wait as expected since I was looking forward to trying this place. The hostess was friendly and quick to seat me. As a disclaimer, I completely empathize with employees within the service industry; particularly in these touristy areas which become extremely busy, so I always have patience and understanding if things take a while. It can be super overwhelming and anxiety can take over, so I understand mishaps. However, when employees are blatantly rude and inattentive, it should be brought to a supervisor's attention so they can be corrected.
I was seated and was promptly greeted by a waitress. I ordered water, waited 30 minutes for my waitress to return to take my order as she said she'll be right back to grab me a menu -- I never saw her again. Went up to the bar politely asking if I could place an order, whenever they had a moment (not even requesting to sit there since I understand the seating arrangements for reservations). They rudely said I needed to be checked in in order to sit, after just explaining that I had been seated yet I haven't seen my waitress in half an hour. 
Meanwhile, I saw everyone who was in line behind me receive their food, who obviously had different and attentive servers. The bartender didn't even consider letting me place an order, didn't apologize for the poor service, despite me already waiting to receive a seat in the restaurant which I would've happily returned to if he had been willing to place my order. He simply said no, with no apology or any question of who my server was so I could be assisted. So bizarre. Wish I could've tried this place due to the great reviews and my love for Thai food!",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,PapaNomad F.,"Not sure what the hype is about. the food here was very mediocre at best.  here is what we had and thought:
garlic shrimp - ok
tom yum soup - good
khao soi with braised beef - ok
green curry with fish - barely edible 
thai ice tea - just ok
i don't recommend and don't plan to eat there again.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yaping D.,"The best Thai food in Toronto and (in my opinion) one of the best restaurants in Toronto! I know everyone says this but trust me it's not overrated at all. Their Penang curry is my favourite!! Not only is the food delicious, but the service is spectacular and the plating of their dishes are so fun. The cocktails are also all really good, with fun Asian twists. The Lowry is a must on a hot summer night.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenne E.,"Loved this place. We arrived right before the huge dinner rush and were seated at the bar only waiting 5 mins. All the staff and bartenders were very attentive and awesome! The vibe of the place is very cool, they played 90s high hop which was very enjoyable. The food was excellent and so was my Thai mojito. I had chicken satay for an appetizer and chicken massaman for my main dish, both were perfect! I definitely recommend trying this place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Catherine Y.,"We arrived at 12:05 on a Friday, and despite having been open for literally five minutes, Pai was already packed, which is always a great sign! We ordered the khao soi, massaman curry, and pad thai. Each was the best version of that dish either of us had ever tried. The depth of flavor in the sauces was so impressive, and every protein, vegetable, and noodle/grain of rice was cooked perfectly. Service was quick.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Justine S.,"I LOVED this place! The atmosphere, the food, the service, the story behind the restaurant, everything is excellent. These two people met and fell in love in Pai and they decided to bring back their love of cooking and of Pai to Toronto. How amazing is that???!!
My high school friend took my boyfriend and I here on our last day. He says it's a popular spot amongst Ryerson students. 
Upon entering it just had the feel of authenticness and creativity. We only ordered a pad thai to share because we were planning on hitting more spots later in the day. Although it was hard to resist the plates of good food that the servers were bringing everyone else.
We got it really mild and it was so good. Lots of well blended flavours and textures. 
You NEED to come here. 
Visited on July 2nd 2017",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andre J.,"Simply the best Thai food I've ever had. The Tom yum is just perfect.
The Crispy pork Pad Kra Pao is so comforting.
Nice drink selection, good vibe, great service.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kerry W.,"For our monthly Tuesday downtown Toronto visit, my husband and I decided to try Pai. Which is just around the corner from the Princess of Whales Theatre (Duncan and Adelaide). When we arrived and stepped into the restaurant the atmosphere was quite interesting. The interior was decorated with items from Thailand which was nice to see. The restaurant was quite large with plenty of seating (may be 75 plus) and it also had a Pai Market from those who are in a rush and just need something to go. I have to say...it's quite the hot spot for lunch goers for a Tuesday.
Since it was our first time at Pai, our eyes wanted to eat the whole menu...however we did keep our order to a minimum of two apps: Papaya Salad (which we requested for Thai Spicy) and Kung Tawt which is the fried black garlic shrimp with Thai Dipping sauce. Both apps were very flavourful and delicious. However if you cannot handle spicy food...remember to check ask the waiter about the spice levels.
As for our main dish, I ordered the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup which was extremely savory and appetizing. I couldn't stop eating even when I was full to my neck! My husband ordered the Fried Fish with Green Curry Sauce and Rice. The fish was perfect cooked and the batter for the fish was perfectly fried for the perfect amount of crisp. The flavours in the fish and curry were exquisite and mouth-watering. 
Can't wait to go back to try more items from the menu!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ida N.,"Pai never disappoints. The food is consistently good no matter what you get. I try new items on the menu or different combinations (e.g. with meat, shrimp, chicken, fish) each time and I always leave happy with what I got. The service is good and the line is never too bad, especially if you get a drink while you wait.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike V.,One of my go to spots for Thai food in the city. Pad Thai and pad sew ew are two of my favourites here. I always opt for a mild or medium spicy level to give it a bit of a kick,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carmen H.,"I've gotten take out and dined in, here are my experiences:
Take out - we ordered via UberEats (dinner time)
- got 3 pad thai, 1 of them had some blue plastic in it... 
- portion is good
- tasted good 
Dine in (lunch time)
- pad thai was too salty (all 4 that we ordered) 
One thing I always get is their thai iced tea!!! Love it!  Tip for this: bring a reusable straw - their straws are paper and it gets too soggy. It's also difficult to drink it without a straw because of the crushed ice.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Selina V.,"Many people recommended me to try this Thai dining place as they said the taste is same as the real Thai food in Thailand.
well, its cool, especially the Tom Yum Soup. You must try this and you will taste many different types of herbs inside.
Recommend this place but no 5 stars because many food were sold out today such as all the salads and their famous mango sticky rice.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,sandy w.,"Visiting from DTLA, CA and hands down... thee best Thai food I've ever had in my entire life. The heat, the savory, the acidity, and the balance of all things magical that make every dish at Pai that decadently transport you back to the northern province of Thailand. Must get: Pud See Ewe, Tom Yum Soup, Chicken Satay, Beef salad, Shrimp chips, etc. You will not be disappointed and will only be captivated by the Pai! Eric was amazing, warm, and welcoming!
-Would I come back? In the blink of an eye!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sadaf D.,"Great atmosphere and energy, pretty packed, so expect a short wait. The hosts are fantastic and the server was nice enough. The prices are quite reasonable too! 
We ordered a Thai sausage appetizer sampler which was delicious!
For entres we ordered the pad cha hett (vegetarian option) and the masaman braised beef. Both were fantastic and had a comfortable level of heat.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Derek S.,"Came by for lunch the other day and the experience left much to be desired despite being Thai Select... 
Was able to be seated upon arrival upon opening and ordered the Thai tea which was a tad too sweet...not quite like Thailand...
Moved on to the Khao Soi with braised beef and it was ok. The braised beef was dry and overcooked....bummer
The crispy pork belly was embarrassing as i think it was refried from yesterday and was super dry...
Staff was ok. Portions were generous.
$30/head after gratuity and tax for lunch...",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris C.,"Let me start by saying the food at Pai is delicious! Nice presentation. The service is excellent! Quaint layout with simple decor. Very busy!
We started with a pitcher of sangria. I can't remember all the ingredients but there was guava and lychee involved. Very refreshing.
The spring rolls were crispy and delicious. Also vegetarian for the health conscious.
Pad Gra Prow with Crispy Pork (Moo Grob), served over rice, was outstanding! The pork had a lot of flavour and I loved the crispy bits.
The green curry chicken was creamy and rich with a coconut curry flavour! I'd be happy with just the sauce over rice.
The Pad Thai with beef may be one of the best I've had! Every bite had a different layer of taste and texture.
The fried fish with green curry sauce was perfectly crispy, yet flaky. As good as it was, we preferred the other dishes.
Was this the best Thai restaurant I've been to? Maybe. I highly recommend it. I'll be back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lana L.,"Pai was a recommendation from a friend who is familiar with downtown Toronto and I'm so glad we made a visit. We arrived around 1:45pm on a Sunday not knowing that they open at 3pm on Sundays. We got some drinks nearby while we waited for the restaurant to open. We returned at 2:55pm and there were already a few people waiting outside. We were surprised there were other people trying to eat at such a random time. The restaurant opened and my boyfriend and I were seated. It was hard not to notice that within just 25 minutes of the restaurant opening at 3pm on a Sunday, it was nearly filled! At this point, we were thinking that this place must be good. 
We were right! We had Thai iced tea, green curry (served in a coconut), and pad Thai with shrimp. We enjoyed the Thai iced tea; it was definitely better than average. The green curry was really awesome and flavorful. The coconut that it is served in is small, so you get the rest of it in a regular bowl. The pad Thai was better than average as well. My boyfriend really liked the shrimp in particular. Our food came out in about 15 minutes after placing our orders. 
Very lovely ambiance with warm lighting. Good service. Great experience overall. Zero complaints. We were impressed!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily R.,"O. M. G! This place was worth the hype and so much more! We had a reservation at 9, but arrived a half hour early. They sat us right away. I love that type of customer service! 
Upon entering the ambiance is great. They had pictures of celebrities who have come here and loved it including basketball players and the like. The restaurant appeared small because it was so packed, but has as good amount of seating. I loved the décor. It gave off a bit of an exotic feel without appearing tacky. It was great! 
The waiters are efficient, but since its so busy they come sparingly and take your entire food order at once, so when you get there make sure you get down to business and decide what you want to order. I looked at the menu before coming and knew immediately what I wanted to eat. We ordered the moo ping for an appetizer. It was decadent and full of flavor. From the time I sat down I knew I wanted the pad thai and ordered that right way. Luckily you were able to choose your spice level for this dish. I chose mild which was just on the cusp of being too spicy for me. It felt a kick in the back of my throat, but nothing I couldn't handle. If I can handle it, anyone certainly can. I loved the flavor! Since I have never been to Thailand, I don't know how authentic it is, but it was good regardless. The portions were perfect for me, but my fiancé thought it was a little small. They have seasonal deserts which constantly change. We got mango sticky rice and it was refreshing and unique. That isn't something I have ordered or even seen before (perhaps its not all that unique though, it just felt that way to me!) I loved it! 
The drinks were ok. I really liked my plum mule, but my fiancé wasn't a fan of his thai mojito. I tried it and prefer a more traditional mojito myself, but it wasn't bad. I like the fact you can't taste the alcohol. 
Overall, this is a must if you live in or are visiting Toronto. What an enjoyable experience!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sammie S.,"Hard to know how to rate this one, but I think a 4 overall is fair.
There was a lineup to get in, but tables for two were readily available so we did not have to wait other than in the line to check in. I liked all the cozy little spaces and how you have to weave through the rooms. 
I was so impressed that they can manage both vegan and gluten free. I ordered a beef Penang curry without shrimp paste and they were great. That Penang curry was a solid 10/10 from me. Yummy and generously sized (I could not finish).
The oxtail was a bit of a miss. More sweet and spite and none of the savory you would expect with oxtail. The shrimp chips was a ridiculously large appetizer and therefore a good value. Tasty enough that the leftovers were brought home.
This is a good repeat with allergies in our family. I am sure that our teenager will love it.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Suganya H.,"Heard this place is really famous in downtown and tried with my colleagues...
I tried the pad Thai... it was sweet eventhougjt I said almost closest to the max spice level.
I will probably try some curry again. :)
The veggie roll was good :)",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angie K.,"Did takeout. $16.50 chicken pad Thai ""foreigner spicy."" I thought it was good but the dish is like 80% noodles, would have expected more chicken for that price. The staff all seem to be English-speaking, so placing an order on the phone was easy. And they were all extremely nice.
I'd go back here.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joyce L.,"Just another Thai restaurant. 
Got Pad Gra Prow with ground pork (mild) and Khao Soi with beef. 
Pad Gra Prow is really oily. Can't taste the basil flavor at all. I.e. It's lacking the flavor that makes it a pad gra prow. Also, mild means no spicy here apparently, would have ordered medium spicy if I knew that. Pad gra prow is my favorite northern Thai dish and I order it every single time when I see it on a menu, so it was really disappointing to have this. If you want to try a real  and yummy pad gra prow, a Thai food truck in Austin or Jinda Thai in Abbotsford, Melbourne Australia can do a much better job than this place. 
Khao Soi is not special. Beef is very tough and dry. Khao Soi at Kin Khao in San Francisco or Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas are better options.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Seraphine B.,"I miss their Thai food there!
The curry and Tom yum soup are always two of the dishes that I always ordered! Must try if you loveeee Thai food! :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Abigail G.,"Came in at 4pm and was seated right away even though it was already pretty crowded. The khao soi is a must try and the chicken satay was also very tasty. Their food is also very reasonably priced. 
Because our server was busy and it was pretty loud, she didn't hear us order a khao soi and we realized she didn't put it in after we thought we were waiting too long for it. It was honestly really hard to get her attention too so we asked a couple other servers to check if the order was in and they said that it wasn't initially but that it was coming now and that it would be discounted. Although it was a little annoying, I understand how she could have missed it and the discount was a pleasant surprise. Kudos to all of them for handling it so well!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victor Y.,"Be aware this is for 4 persons size. We as 2 people are  talked into ordering it to substitute for running out of mango stick rice. This costs 18 cad, the same price of a main course. We weren't be warned either size or quantity. It consists most of supermarket quality ice cream with large quantities, we ended up left more than half unfinished. There is very little mango and coconut meats. We are happy with everything else except this. After I have talked to a waiter on this, no action from their side. Overpriced dessert. I was super excited to learn this restaurant from a  YouTube channel, but wasn't happy about this experience. not a repeat. Hopefully you 'd be cautious with any suggestions from waiters.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shabbar S.,"Thai food is definitely one of my favorite types of food and Pai has been on my list of places to try for a long time.  It has a great atmosphere and the food was really good as well. It is always busy here and I must say that the service was pretty good for how busy it was. 
We ordered a few different dishes which included: Thai chicken wings, Kung Tawt (Black Tiger garlic shrimp), and as a main I had the Khao Soi.
Thai Chicken Wings: I am a big fan of wings and these did not disappoint. The flavours were great and the crispy shallots were a nice touch
Kung Tawt: These deep fried breaded tiger shrimp were good, but nothing to write home about. the quality of the shrimp itself was really good but I feel as if you could get a similar dish at many places. 
Khao Soi: This was definitely the star of the night for me. I am a big fan of soupy noodles and the curry broth that was in here was very rich and flavourful. It was spiced just right and I just could not stop eating!
All in all I would come back to Pai and recommend it to anyone looking for good Thai food. The quality of the food was good and the atmosphere was a plus. My only complaint would be that I would have liked the portion size for the mains to be a bit bigger.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brittany S.,Went to the Young and Eg location.  Live music Thursday nights! Great food like the downtown location!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susan V.,"Came here on a Monday at lunch and it was really busy. I love the cool, hipster vibe of this place, it feels very casual, has really cool decor, theres a bar and overall it just feels comfortable.
We ordered the Papaya Salad which I really liked. The papaya is soaked in tamarind sauce giving it a sweet & sour taste, it came with flavourful shrimp chips, crispy pork grinds, some noodles and cabbage. Everything eaten together tastes so good! Definitely recommend!
I had the Masaman Beef Curry, at first the bowl looks kind of small but its actually very filling. They give you a lot of beef (perfect for meat lovers) and its very tender. The curry tastes like regular curry but with a hint of sweet&sour tamarind which I really liked.
My friend had the Khao Soi and to me it was just ok, it tastes like a regular coconut curry. Reminds me of a Malaysian Laksa.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alison L.,"Unpopular opinion here but I think this place is overhyped. The food isn't absolutely terrible, but I've had better Thai food elsewhere. 
When I was eating there I was super hungry so everything tasted really good and I wolfed it all down...but when I think back it was only good because I was so hungry. 
The oxtail was okay but there was barely any oxtail in it. They use a big bowl to make it seem like a bigger portion but it's really not that much and for $16, not really worth it. The pad thai was just okay...it wasn't very flavorful and it was kind of dry. The Khao Soi was very heavy tasting and also didn't come with a lot of stuff in it. The chicken wings were pretty good but nothing special. 
Chill place and vibes, but I found the food very average overall and expensive for the portions.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nathan A.,"Been here a few times. Always busy. Even when the weather's not great, expect a bit of a wait.
On my latest visit, we ordered shrimp chips, the Pad Thai, Khao Soi (egg noodles) and a Thai Iced Tea.
The shrimp chips comes as a big sized bowl, are pretty tasty, and served with a tamarind sauce; a little sweetness to compliment the savoury chips. The Pad Thai tastes quite like the ones I've had in Thailand, different from what you might find at places like Thai Express. A little saltier, and less sweet.
My favourite though is the Khao Soi: egg noodles in a curry-based soup, topped with some fried noodles and your choice of meat (go for the braised beef). Comes with a small side dish of pickled veg, lime, and hot sauce. Very flavourful. The Thai Iced Tea is pretty good too.
Probably my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. Will come back again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daphne T.,"PAI is one of those restaurants that come top of mind when my friends, in town and out of town, want to catch up over a meal. With the recent renovations to help expand the space, it's been progressively easier to nab a table for a small group. 
My favourite appetizers are the Grabong (shredded squash fritters) and Miang Kung, both which are great for sharing. Standout mains include the Pad Thai (of course), Red Curry, and Pad Gra Pow.
To top the meal off, you can't go wrong with the Sticky Mango Rice, or a Thai Iced Tea!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,rochelle s.,"Really happy we found this while visiting Toronto, excellent Thai food, excellent service , a little spicy for us but delicious , Go!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amoli P.,"The reviews did not lead me wrong! I was in Toronto for work last week and wanted to grab some tasty Thai before returning to Chicago (aka the land of mediocre Thai food). Pai is not your standard Thai place or menu but what they do, they do really well. 
I stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon before my flight and was amazed to see the place packed at 4pm. I snagged the last available table and sat down as the line started to form out the door. 
The menu is limited in that they don't have all the classic Thai dishes like cashew chicken or ginger chicken. But they have plenty of options for curries, noodles and a few stir frys. So everyone will find something. 
I started with the Tom yum soup which was by far the most unique and delicious version of Tom yum I had ever enjoyed. A very tasty base with fresh shrimp and spice. 
For my entree I opted for the pad gra pow. I had never seen this dish served with a fried egg on top but this felt more streets of Thai authentic so I was happy to try it. The sauce was heaven and the chicken was finely cut without being ground that seemed to keep it tender and full of flavor. The egg enhanced everything. This dish was pure perfection and heaven and unlike any other variation I've ever had. 
By the time I left the line was easily 25-30 deep and it wasn't even 5pm yet. The hype is real and worth it. I highly recommend a visit to Pai but do it during an off peak time to avoid waiting. I hope to be back to Toronto soon just to enjoy Pai again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chaz W.,"Are you a foodie? Do you want Thai food? Look no further! 
Wish I could have tried more, but I was all by myself. Lol I started off with the atom Yum soup. Surprisingly, this was my favorite dish. The soup was super flavorful, and full of fresh and delicious vegetables & shrimp. Perfect combo of sour and spice. 
Main course - pad Thai with beef. Definitely the best ps Thai I've ever had. Perfect noodles, well balanced ingredients, and great flavor. I ordered it with farang spice (regular spice), I thought it was delicious, but next time I'll order the Thai spice. 
Great prompt service too! I walked in around 2pm on a Wednesday. The main room was pretty busy, so I can imagine this place is swamped during average lunch and dinner hours.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bernard W.,"On a Thursday night, I was surprised to see how busy this place is. Once I got inside I noticed the decor and settings to be quite warm and welcoming. Line up was fairly short and the staffs are quite attentive. For my first ever order I had to get the pad thai. Portion was good enough and the taste was there. We also ordered some chicken wings and they were really delicious and tender. Enough taste to satisfy my palette. Overall I really enjoyed the vibe and experience. 1 star off because the washroom has a very unpleasant sewage smell. Better if they added scented candles.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shaheer M.,"I don't know why I didn't give them 5 stars in the beginning as there really is nothing i'd like Pai to change/improve on. Their food tastes the same every time and their service is always on point! Don't go on my check-ins, I have been here more times than I can remember.
We are truly blessed to have Chef Nuit in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Howraa A.,"Hip young Thai restaurant that meets or surpasses  the old school authentic Thai restaurant taste! Cool decor and atmosphere, played good music. Young waiters and waitresses. 
Accommodated us by seating us at the bar! They also had the option of traditional Thai floor seating. 
We were in a rush and opted to sit at the bar. The food was unreal!!!!!!!! 
We had a papaya salad for starters which we were hoping was spicy but literally had no spice factor at all. It was ehh...I have had better.
But the main dishes were top notch.
I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with chicken and I can not stop thinking about it. So delicious. The pad thai was also yummy. But the Pad Gra Prow was my absolute fav.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy W.,"My friends and I were craving Thai food for lunch so we came here. 
Food:
Pad Gra Prow 13...Try it with Shrimp or Crispy Pork (Moo Grob) 15
Holy basil stir fried with your choice of ground Pork, Chicken, Beef or Tofu served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a thai style fried egg. (contains oyster sauce) Served with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime)
I wanted to try both shrimp and pork at the same time. I preferred the ground pork over the crispy pork in the rice. It was nicely marinated and flavourful! I've asked for their chili oil. It went well with the rice. 
Nice happy atmosphere. Good service and very authentic Thai good. I am so glad I came!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt S.,"I had one meal here and my mouth still waters every time I think about it. We ordered as much as we could stuff into ourselves and it was absolutely mindblowingly good. I love Thai food, and I was told by a friend that this was the place in Toronto. I'm so glad I went and I can't wait to go back. I can't remember what I ordered at this point - but I don't think it's possible to order wrong. The spice level was higher than most Thai places, the freshness was outstanding. It was busy (pre-COVID) but so worth the 15-ish minute wait.
If we lived closer, we'd be here way too often!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roseanne N.,"The lineups here were quite intense if you didn't have a reservation. We decided last minute to eat here so reservations were al booked for the week. 
When we arrived we had to wait in line to even get an electronic pager. Once we got the pager we waiting at the back until the lights flashed, signaling that our table was ready.
We ordered several items on the menu. We started off with a small Tom Yum soup. It was probably one of the most savoury and delicious soups I've ever had. The soup had a strong fragrant scent of lemongrass and had a good kick of heat. 
Next, we got the Gaeng Kiaw Wan (Green Curry) and the Khao Soi. The curry was served in a coconut with a side of extra curry and rice. Again, the aroma was amazing. The curry was creamy and light. It was really delicious. The Khao Soi was definitely my favourite dish. You are served a massive bowls of noodles in a coconut-curry broth and contains egg noodles topped with fried noodles. The broth was extremely flavourful. It had savoury and sweet elements that really brought out the dish. I also enjoyed the tender bites of beef. I was so full after eating.
Overall, I was quite satisfied with both the service and food here. Definitely need to book in advance next time!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Martha D.,"Wow there's definitely a reason why this is the most reviewed restaurant in Toronto. Definitely call in with a reservation to this place because it was packedddddd. First of all the place was HUGE. When you walk in it looks like a very small shop but don't be fooled. The vibe felt extremely homey and vintage. I loved it.
I ordered the Tea Mac cocktail which was basically an alcoholic Thai tea and it was amazing. I could barely taste the alcohol it was so good. I also ordered the Tom yum soup which was fantastic. The portion was smaller but it was the perfect amount of spice. For the entree I got the Khao Soi, I was blown away. I typically don't love curries but this was a very light chicken coconut curry with noodles. It was soooo good. And for dessert we got the egg custard sticky rice. Probably some of the best Thai food I've ever had in my life.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stefania M.,"Great time here. 
Got seated right away in the bar area during the post work rush. 
Ordered Grabong for a starter and it was delicious. 
I had the Pad Cha Hett and it was amazing. So much flavour for a vegetarian (possibly vegan?!) dish.
Service was a bit slow but still great. Food was great. Atmosphere was great. 
Would definitely come again and again.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Don W.,"The food and service were great. Our dinners had an excellent flavor. The only negative was that portions were a bit small, with lots of rice or noodles and a small portion of meat and veg.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Estefania C.,"It was so delicious! I had the Pad Thai and the portion was generous and the perfect amount of spicy!
Highly recommend, will definitely try again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yvanna L.,"Best Thai place in town! I've only tried their Pas Thai, Khao Soi and duck wings and I recommend it all!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda C.,Really fun spot in Toronto with great Thai food! Lots of variety and the waiters always knows what they're doing. No worries when I go with friends with lots of dietary restrictions from allergies. The waiters are honest and friendly. Make sure to get the Thai iced tea!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy F.,A fantastic meal. Restaurant was very busy but service was very quick. Didn't wait long for anything. Food was epically delicious. Recommend.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,P. A.,"Over-priced, small portions, bland and just disappointing. I wouldn't recommend at all.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie C.,"So. Full.
Delightful Thai food. I had the pad Thai with beef and the garlic shrimp. It was delicious! Came with six other friends, make sure you make reservations! This place was packed. We could only have lunch at 3:00 pm. 
The place is hot, noisy, and crowded. Beyond these slight discomforts, the food is really the standout quality of this restaurant. Be prepared to pay slightly more than your normal pad Thai. But we had monster leftovers after. 
FYI my spice level for my pad Thai was medium. I normally have a generally higher tolerance of spice than the average person, and I was slightly sweating while eating it! Might have bit into a pepper or something because whew my mouth was burning! Even the garlic shrimp had a kick to it.
Despite how busy it is, the staff never rush you while ordering or eating your meal. They get it. The food is worth savoring. They're helpful and friendly. 
Overall I'd definitely recommend eating here!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chloe M.,"Food: A very popular place in downtown for thai food and it definitely did not disappoint me at all! I did not order pad thai (what I usually stick with) because I was trying to be more adventurous and I was very glad with my food choices! I highly recommend the pork rice with egg as it was the best out of three. Im guessing the pork was marinated with a lot of different ingredients and so with the fish sauce and lime juices, there was a burst of different flavours going on in a single bite. The chicken wings were amazing as well but nothing too surprising. The curry noodle was very interesting as I did not expect them to use egg noodle, the beef brisket was too hard though. I did still enjoy the coconut heavy flavoured curry overall. 
Portion: Normal to small
Environment: I was put to sit at a high table and the only issue was that there was no where to hang my winter jacket. Other than that the vibe of the restaurant was really nice with all the decors!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alice G.,"Warm welcome fr (server) Maketa who eats here 'every night'. ('Not Jealous!') The curry is 'out of this world', the fish, chicken or pork soo succulent and fresh. Chicken pad thai also very tasty. Personable yet uber efficient service. N.B. On  Sat at 5:10 pm we had a 70 min wait, so arrive early to leave yr contact info.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patricia G.,"Wow, there's over a thousand reviews to this place. Cool. That just shows glhow great it is. 
Location:
Downtown toronto.  2 blocks from King Street street car.
Parking situation:
May the force be with you. 
Actually I exaggerate. There's a parking garage practically around the corner. Lots of spaces. Pretty reasonable. 
Entrance:
The sign has an arrow pointing up but it's in the basement. Confusing at first.
Seating:
Been a few times. The last time. It opened at 3. We got there at 3:15 and had to sit at the bar. Crazy. After we ordered 20 minutes later we looked and there was a line at the door. Crazier. 
They have floor seating apparently as well. No thanks. 
Food:
Delicious. Loved everything. I'm not even going g to list everything I've tried and lived. It's all good. For real.
Price:
Not bad. Upper end for Thai food, bit Thai is normally super inexpensive anyway. Won't break the bank
 
I'll be back!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nisha N.,"Almost a year after my first visit which was not as exciting and ended with a three-star review. 
This visit was very different, my cousin was visiting and she wanted to have Thai food and this was the closest place. We were seated within 15 mins (minus reservation on a Wednesday afternoon) and got to try their traditional seating which was very comfortable. 
We ordered the fried Tiger Shrimp, Chicken Fried Rice, Beef Panag Curry, Mango Sticky Rice, and Thai Iced Tea. The Iced Tea was much better than the last time and the Chicken Fried Rice was delicious! It was also my first time trying Mango Sticky Rice and it was so good. The Beef Panag Curry was good but not the best I've had. Overall the experience was much better this time around and I'll definitely be making another visit soon!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Philippe C.,"Really loved that place! It's easy to find a restaurant with good thai food, but it's not that easy to find a thai restaurant that has a nice mood. I often find that thai restaurant are too simple or too formal.
The crowd is pretty young, mostly people in their 20s. Staff is also super dynamic and the food was awesome.
PAI is the kind of place that as soon as you step inside the restaurant, you can smell the good food, see people having fun and you just know right away that you came to the right place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jun L.,The food is absolutely the best Thai you may find almost any where in North America. Excellent ambience as you were in Thailand at one of the bars or food stand. All people are friendly and providing really great service.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy H.,"My sister and I came here for an early dinner at ~4:30pm on a weekday, and we were glad we came that early because the place filled up very quickly that people were lining up at the door even before we got our food. We got Pad Thai with shrimp, Green Curry, and Thai Iced Tea. 
Food-wise, I was really satisfied: everything was delicious with good portion sizes. But I'm docking off a star for the service. The Thai Iced Tea was brought to me without a straw, and no employee walked by us for a while, so I had to go up to the bar to ask for a straw. Also, the Green Curry was supposed to come in a coconut shell with the coconut flesh still in the shell such that you can eat the coconut flesh with the curry, but they were out of coconut on this night. I was looking forward to this coconut experience, but I missed out. Hopefully I visit Toronto again soon because I'd really love to try it!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Greg F.,"After hearing all the hype about this place I was really excited to try out the food for dinner. Honestly there was nothing wrong with the food but I think this place is really overrated. 
The pad graw prow was good, but the portions were a bit small. The dish had a nice savoury flavour but it wasn't really anything special. The gai satay (chicken skewers) were also decent but nothing special. You can't go wrong with thai iced tea, I'm definitely glad I ordered it. 
In general the food here was just average, but definitely not worth the wait if you don't have a reservation. Remember to make your reservation like a week in advance if you plan on coming for dinner.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alisha L.,"This place is a gym! 
Even my Uber driver told me that he picks up orders from here and it's always packed. 
Do I was excited when I pulled up, once inside there was a bit of a wait. After I situated myself in line I waited no more than 12-15mins. And luckily I was by myself so I was seated right away at the bar. 
To wrap this experience up the food was delicious! Omg!!! I wanted to order from there the next night but they weren't available at the time on Uber Eats.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gabby K.,"OMG YES! Please do yourself a favor if you're visiting Toronto and stop by Pai. We visited with a Toronto native who high recommended this spot. Upon walking in the vibe was great! The laid back atmosphere was a great way to fight the polar vortex. 
We glanced over the menu and my eye fixed on the winter dog drink, this drink had lychee in it, so I was in! Not only was this drink extremely delicious but it was extremely strong, I was buzzed before our meals were even dropped off.
We decided to share lunches family style, the items that we ordered were the green curry, khao so and tom yum. Everything looked so good and we noticed that the portions were pretty large so you can def share. 
Pretty quickly our meals were dropped off nice hot and ready to be devoured. The tom yum was pretty plain which is surprising because the green curry and khao so were over the top amazing! I loved the green curry the best, it a savory curry sauce with mild spice packed with so much flavor! This little spot is definitely a Toronto go to!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dess L.,"My husband made dinner reservations for us at this restaurant. I would say this was the best restaurant we ate at during our week-long vacation in Toronto. We ordered the papaya salad, tom-yum soup, braised beef noodle soup, chicken pad Thai, and Thai tea. 10/10 for the papaya salad, tom-yum soup, and Thai tea. 10/10 for the customer service. Highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mariam S.,"Good Thai food, the service is excellent and the place is nice",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa T.,"One of my fav Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto! I always love going here for the food and vibes. I suggest making a reservation though, because they always have a wait during peak times (I went on a Wednesday around 630 PM and had to wait 1 hour for a table of 5). I always order their Pad Thai with shrimp and their papaya salad is a must order!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mariyana K.,"Great food and service!! I had the CHIANG MAI beef noodle soup and was outstanding!! Rich flavors and a big size - you don't need to order anything else to get full!!
Next time in Toronto will visit again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lindsay L.,"I'm obsessed with this restaurant... I never really liked Thai food before coming to Toronto - but this place has converted me! And I'm surprised at how many Toronto residents don't know about them! I love the atmosphere, the service, and of course, the food! My favourite is the Khao San beef brisket soup... The meat is so tender, and the broth is extremely flavourful. The combination of soft and hard noodles is also very unique!! Worth a visit for sure if you're in town.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren G.,"Great food, fun atmosphere & cool staff. 
The wait situation: line up to put your name in, then wait from there. Waiting times vary. Reservations are only made in advance.
The drink menu is awesome. 
We shared the fried shrimp appetizer, green curry with chicken (served in a coconut!), and crispy fish. 
The curry was my favorite, and important to note that the chicken was very tender (not dry, as is often the case when I order chicken with Thai curries). 
Their house chili oil is excellent if you like to add spice.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lu M.,"Went there on a thursday night at around 6:15 and surprisingly there was a line for this place. I guess it is a popular spot around here. Waited about 10 mins to get in, but there were empty tables thats reserved while there was a line outside. 
We ordered the curry that comes in a coconut (green curry) and the panang curry. We also had their fried i think is butternut squash and their thai ice tea. Everything taste good. Wait time for the food was minimal, service was good and i dont have a bad thing to say about this place. 2 people spent about 70 including tax and tips.
I would recommend coming here but maybe make a reservation ahead of time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael L.,"That Umbrella Guy @ Pai for lunch.
We got in early when they opened at 11:30, and within half an hour most of the restaurant was filled. Except the Pai Market. They don't take reservations for lunch, so it'll be a bit of a battle to get seats.
Now, if you're in a rush, there is the Pai market that I mentioned. It's a section in the back of the restaurant (go to the back and turn right) that offers a number of merchandise and ingredients for sale, as well as some lunch combo options separate from the regular menu. For $10, you can grab one item (might be like a curry, or a stir-fry, or something) with rice. Great if you don't want to wait in a huge line.
 
Since our group had made arrangements to get here early, we got seats.
Their menu is not too big: around 10 or 15 items in total. This should make ordering a bit easier.
I ordered a Pad Thai at Thai Spicy level. The waitress asked if I was sure that I wanted the thai spicy, just in case I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into. It was definitely a bit spicy, as I could feel the heat on my tongue, but not dangerously spicy as others at the table had warned. But I think if you're not good with heat, it might be something to avoid.
The pad thai was alright. Not too greasy, and came with a generous amount of chicken.
The heat definitely makes it a bit interesting, though perhaps I should try it without as much spice next time to get more of the flavour.
20% auto-grat is applied on parties of 6 or more, which I'm not a fan of. In terms of service, it gets really really busy so they have less time to tend to your needs. I guess the auto-grat is meant to take that into consideration?",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Afiya R.,"Pai was another restaurant that was scouted on Yelp before we arrived in Toronto. The reviews were great and I absolutely love Thai food. 
We arrived here minutes to 9PM. The place was packed and I should have expected that, we were in the entertainment district on a Friday night. The restaurant is a lower level type restaurant.There was a along line going down the stairs to just put your name on the wait-list. We contemplated leaving but we decided to head straight to the take out area instead.  For a Asian restaurant to play urban music and reggae music was quite interesting.  It had a nice Caribbean vibes (Welcome to the 6ix!)
We ordered two Pad Gra Prow, one chicken and the other with shrimp served w/ (steamed jasmine rice, thai style fried egg, nam price nam pla sauce). We also ordered a fried fish (crispy base fillet, steamed jasmine rice, crispy shallots, fresh chili sauce and tangy tamarind sauce). The wait for our take out wasn't bad. They have a nice little charging station for people to charge their iPhones. (unfortunately the ports were dated)
With most Thai restaurants, the atmosphere, decor is as important as the taste of the food and the beautiful arrangement of there dishes. So I'm sorry I didn't get the full experience.  Overall the food was good and I would return.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chloe C.,I got the pad thai. The portion was decent but the flavour was average. Service was good and I liked the ambience but it is a little loud.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Krystle S.,The food was delicious! The wings were some of the best I've had. Definitely recommend them. I also got the Laksa soup which was also delicious. I also have to shout out the music wall in the women's bathroom. I appreciate all the love for Black American artists.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hui F.,"It's my second time being here. Really love the food. It's always so popular even in a weekday, if u have a dinner date, make sure u call and make the reservation.
Thai chicken wing - super yum, we only places one order, I would place 2 orders if I wanna share with 2 other people.
Tom yum soup - the tomato soup base was really fresh and flavourful.
Mango and sticky rice - basic
If u like Thai food. I would recommend u to try it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Caterina P.,Delicious Thai food that tastes authentic and is very filling. This restaurant is always busy so it could be tough to get a spot but everything from the pad Thai to shrimp is delicious. The spice is just right too.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tina Y.,"Great place downtown for thai food. Place does get pretty crowded, always best to make reservations. 
Beware, ""Farang spicy"" is still very spicy!!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cynthia W.,"We mistakenly believed that this restaurant would be empty at 5:15 on a weekday. It was anything but. Luckily, they were able to get a table for two within five minutes. They've managed to fit quite a lot of people in the space that they have.
I ordered the khao soi, while my friend ordered the pad gra prow. I was starving before my meal, but was quite full within ten minutes. The curry is quite filling by the end. It was a little spicier than I anticipated, but I have very little tolerance, so it probably would be fine for most people. 
Like many others, I was impressed by the service. I've eaten at many other restaurants a lot emptier than Pai with much less attentive employees. Kudos to the servers for making sure all customers were taken care of. I think this practice also ensures that people are in and out within an hour or so. Would definitely return if I was ever craving Thai food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer W.,"Tried Pai for the first time for lunch and liked it enough to eat it again for dinner (though we tried different dishes).
We ordered the spring rolls, Gaeng Kiaw Wan Fish, and Khao Soi Beef.
Spring rolls were delicious. They're deep-fried vegetarian rice paper wraps, mushrooms, glass noodles, carrots. sprouts served with a sweet and spicy Thai chili sauce. One order comes with three rolls cut in half (six pieces).
Though the portions didn't look that big, they were quite filling, and my friend and I couldn't finish all our food.
The Gaeng Kiaw Wan Fish was a curry served in a coconut. Some ""fishing"" was needed to find all the fish pieces. The curry was flavorful but not *too* salty. I liked the bamboo shoots in it and thought the fish was nice too. The consistency was a tad runny for me, but it was still delicious.
The Khao Soi Beef was good as well. The meat was tender and the curry was flavorful. I also liked the crispy noodles that came with it.
Wish I had more of an appetite when I went so I could've tried more dishes, but I guess that'll have to wait until the next time I go.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joyce Y.,"We enjoyed every dish we ordered- pad thai, khao soi, and the oxtail hung lay.  They were very accommodating with the nut and shellfish allergies in our family which we appreciated! Ambience very nice as well!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Juan P.,"Hi Yelpers!
So instead of Kiin I went to PAI. The vibe is very comforting and hip. Love the atmosphere. We were greeted by a pleasant host. 
As for the starters we ordered Grabong. This starter is shredded butter squash fritters that has been lightly covered in red curry paste batter. The fritter is then fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with nuts. It is lovely if you are a fan of fried food similar to French fries or sweet potatoes fries. The red curry on it gives it a very weak spice but adds flavour to it which then is intensified by with the dip. Awesome starter dish!
The next starter we ordered is Gai Satay. 5 grilled marinated chicken skewers with peanut sauce. Love the peanut sauce! That's what I was looking most forward to about this dish. The nuttiness is awesome! Though 5 skewers.. they are small in portion sizes.. downfall for me.
For the main course I got the lovely Gaeng Kiaw Wan which is in a coconut. I'm ut is green curry with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves and coconut milk. The meat I opted for was shrimp. It was delicious. Unsure if the coconut as a base did anything to the dish. 
My partner got the Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. The braised beef is in a peanut, tamarin curry with potatoes and topped off with crispy shallots. Both main courses had jasmine rice. 
The servers were really nice and attentive to making sure we were okay. The service time for food was also pretty fast. 
I really enjoyed my first time experience with PAI. I will definitely come back again!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sophy P.,"This is the best Thai restaurant of all time. Their food is delicious! I had the green curry in the coconut and squash fritters when I stayed in. I had the most spiciest (wished it was spicier) but still so amazing! They had amazing cocktail drinks and next time I will try their Thai ice tea, it was on almost every table when I came in! 
This place was amazing, super busy because everyone is familiar with PAI! It is a must try when you're in downtown Toronto! I can't wait til I bring my boyfriend to try this place! 
I gave it a four star because even though it was the best Thai restaurant in town. It's super busy, always. I can see why, the food speaks for itself! But that being said, my coworkers and I always find it a challenge to call in a take out and sometimes they never pick up! There was two times that we wanted to order take out at work and it was frustrating so we end up ordering at a different place. I was also there on Tuesday and forgot my blanket scarf there, I tried calling that night for it and the next day, no one returned or picked up my phone call. Hopefully, it is still there if I have time to pick it up when I'm not busy at work!
Tip: do make reservations ahead of time if you're planning to eat in! Saves the trouble and so much time!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James L.,"Westernized Thai food, not authentic Thai food. Not recommended for authentic Thai food.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mae P.,"we got the pad thai, garlic shrimps, a mojito, and pineapple shake. i've  had  authentic pad thai in thailand so i found their pad thai  a little too sweet. however, the chicken was very juicy and the noodles were perfectly cooked. as for the shrimps, it was nice and crispy but nothing spectacular. loved their mojito, very refreshing with bold flavors and a strong kick.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nathasja T.,"Do I ever eat or review anything other than Asian food? We will never know.  But what is clear, is that I am a fan, and Pai made me so so happy during a recent visit to Toronto!
I'm not too generous with my five star ratings, but Pai deserves it based on the actual restaurant (so cool!), AND the food - the penang curry specifically!
The restaurant is laid out in very specific seperate rooms, each has a different vibe alltogether. The furniture and decor changes as you walk through the restaurant. It was fun walking through the various dining areas to end up at our bar seat in the back room.  
Once sat, we started with the shrimp crackers, which were a great snacky starter- they aren't porous and airy like your usual orange/white/pink basic shrimp crackers. These were brown, very shrimpy with a hint of spice, and almost cassava cracker-like. They were awesome, and so was the tamarind dip that came with them.
Thai iced teas here were amazing, and we were quite happily drinking those eventhough their cocktails also looked amazing. Especially the lychee one. Some other time! 
He orderded pad thai, I went for my alltime fave the penang curry. Best. Dish. In. A. Long. Time!  Holy cow. The depth of flavors in their version is amazing, each bite you detect different things and you just want to keep eating. I would love some right now, actually.
We had to finish with the mango sticky rice because that dessert is our ""thing"".  I have never met one I don't love, and this was no different. 
I liked Pai so much that I would return in a heartbeat- which says a lot since Toronto has so many other places to discover!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erica C.,"Ive been here before pandemic. It's good food and the interior transports you to what you could imagine to be a hideaway tucked in on a street somewhere in Thailand.
It is a bit pricey and the service is dicey at times and for that I'd dock a star.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ying W.,Haven't tried many dishes but Pad gra prow with crispy pork is really nice. Good vibes and service overall.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tammy L.,one of the best pad thais ive had! a lot of people say its overrated but i enjoyed it. great service and they seated our party pretty quickly too,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Freyhan D.,"What cool spot. Really liked this place. Doesn't look like much from the outside, and quite frankly pretty easy to miss, but inside is a whole other story. It's pretty bumpin! Friendly staff, cool ambience, and the food....great! Good taste, decently priced, decent portions, and a nice simple menu that you don't have to spend hours going through.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lyann L.,"This place was absolutely delicious! Their papaya salad was extremely well balanced and probably one of the best papaya salad I had and believe me, I had alot of papaya salad in the past. Their sangria was extremely tasty and I couldn't get enough of! Everything was authentic and everything  on their menu looked so good.   Great ambience and friendly staff.  My only advise is to come early, they fill up fairly quickly!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristin N.,First time in Canada. Totally recommend this restaurant. Worth the wait. Soup was amazing to start. We had paid Thai and the green curry dish. It was all excellent. Plus great service.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kyle F.,Great overall experience.  The food was yummy and the service was good.  I would recommend this place,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristian U.,"Will this review be number 2200 for Pai? Wow, I had no intention of holding off until then but today as I look at Pai's Yelp page, I'm honorer to be writing this review for Toronto's most popular restaurant or listing.
It's always busy, always, so make sure you plan ahead with either a reservation or show up early to get your spot in line. But surprisingly, for a subterranean restaurant located below Duncan street just south of Adelaide, it's HUGE. You might think that by comparison to other Toronto restaurants that the seating near the main room bar is the end, you'd be wrong. Pai twists and turns like a labyrinth through the streets of Bangkok (and it's eclectic decor adds to this feel) opening up to numerous dining areas, bars and private dining spaces.
It was busy so we told the staff we'd take any seat, even side by side on the bar, which was a smart idea because with other patrons being told the wait would be 45-60 min for a table we were seated in less then 5.
We ordered a couple of drinks to start and at the recommendation of not one but two servers we ordered the MIANG KUNG as a shared appetizer. This social dish was super fun, sort of like DIY Fajitas at a TexMex joint but thai and fresh. It comes with a platter of fresh betel leaves, chilled baby black tiger shrimp, ginger, garlic, shallots, lime, chilli, roasted coconut, roasted peanuts, coconut sugar, and tamarind sauce to toss together into a hand rolls and enjoy. What fun, and so delicious!
Knowing that the chef here is one and the same that started my favourite Thai spot before this - Khao San Road, I knew I needed to order my favourite dish of hers to see if it still held up. KHAO SOI made of fresh egg noodles, golden curry, crispy noodles, coriander, green onions, choice of braised beef, chicken breast or chicken drumsticks. I always go with the braised beef because it's so damn soft and fall apart I couldn't imagine eating it with anything else.
Lastly, service was quick, friendly and really helpful, despite the place being so busy all the time, mistakes would and should have been expected, but no, flawless top to bottom. When I can get a seat here again, I'll definitely be back, if you still haven't pai-d them a visit, get thee to this place and swiftly.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shane J.,"Beautiful location with unique indoor decor. The food was excellent. I have traveled all over Thailand and tried a variety of dishes. I ordered the khao soi which is a famous northern Thailand dish. Pai's khao soi was very delicious and brought back memories of when I first tried it at one of best khao soi restaurants in Thailand. Also, the food came out very quickly and the service was excellent.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jonathan D.,"Best Thai food I ever had in the Toronto area. I came here at 12:10 which is 10mins after they opened and already all of their tables were filled! If I had came any later I would have to wait to be seated. This place was already looking promising. I had the squash fritters, khao soi, pad gra Prow, and their chef nuit pad thai. The squash fritters were a great appetizer with a slight crunchy squash fry dipped in their house made soy sauce, just the thought made me curl my toes. I first had their pad gra prow with beef which was packed with flavor and pieces of minced beef were explosions of umami of their own. The pad gra prow with chicken packed a sweet and sour taste to it which is nice alternative to the umami packed pad gra prow I had before. The most disappointing dish I had was the khao soi but it was still very flavorful. With a light coconut curry broth to it the noodles were coated evenly with the sauce and the beef inside was fall off the fork tender. I was blown away from how tender the beef was but this is my least favorite dish here because I am not a huge fan of curry. Overall I would be coming here again and again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aaron C.,Great sized portions given that inflation is getting out of hand. None the less they did not hold back on any of  the food portions. Great food packed with flavour and fresh ingredients definitively recommend stopping in for some excellent food and lively dining area. They do get quite packed on Saturdays.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rich X.,"I was searching for food and noticed the high reviews so I decided to get lunch to go. I got a tofu pad Thai with medium spicy. It was not spicy whatsoever. The dish itself was very sweet from other pad Thais I had in the past. So I was a little disappointed as this is my usually go to dish for Thai food. I mean there is a chance that this is supposed to be legit pad Thai and I just didn't know it. 
The quality of the noodles, sprouts and tofu was good. It was fresh and cooked well so that's a plus. It's just the flavors that didn't meet my expectations. I may try this place again. There are a few dishes I would like to try. Also it seems like a decent spot to dine in with some friends.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Apurva P.,"extremely good food - very authentic! 
please try the Pad Thai and their desserts are all just amazing - must try !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel P.,First time trying grabong and it was delicious! It was a long wait so better reserve ahead of time! Very nice atmosphere. Serving is a just a little bit less than expected. Other than that great experience!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Guy K.,"In A Nutshell:
-Pai is different than your usual Thai restaurant.
-It's a blend of hipster & Thai food.
-It can get very crowded, regardless of the day of the week.
-The layout is very dark & cozy.
-The food options are easy to order and you can control the level of spice to your tongue's desire.
-The betel leave wraps are very unique & hard to find outside of Thailand, so order that.
Overall, I recommend coming to eat here.  If you want to make reservations, do so in advance.  They won't take dame day reservations bc this place is BUSY & POPULAR.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer W.,"I have always wanted to try Pai but was never able to eat there in person due to how busy they always were, pre-pandemic. Since staying at home I've been able to order from them a few times and WOW. If the food is so good delivered, I can't even imagine how tasty it would be in person!
The chicken and shrimp pad thai is my absolutely favorite. Plentiful chicken and shrimp, the portion size is great, and the flavors are absolutely on point. I also enjoy their spring rolls, but the price seems high for only two spring rolls which don't taste much different from Salad King's spring rolls (for half the price).
I can't wait to try Pai in person, in the meantime I will be reordering delivery and I suggest you do the same!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Calvin L.,"A restaurant with lots of energy and fun place to grab dinner. It is super busy, so I suggest going early. Drinks took surprisingly awhile to get, but the food came out of the kitchen quickly. All of the food tasted great.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maree C.,"This Thai restaurant is SUPER delicious! Made reservations in advance in order to get a table for 2. It gets super busy after 4pm. 
We got seated immediately after we got there. Service was slow and it took a bit of time to get our food and water. Perhaps they are understaffed and it's crazy busy in the restaurant. 
The food was delicious! I have been to Thailand before and it tastes very authentic compared to what I had before. The mango sticky rice was the best I had in Toronto. The pad Thai was flavourful and not just sweet. We ordered chicken fried rice and it was perfect. The portion was decent but we definitely needed 2 entrees, 1 appetizers and 1 dessert to be full. We also ordered chicken satay. Everything was flavourful and authentic. Highly recommended to come here for lunch/dinner! 
I would definitely come back again in the future! Love their hipster vibe!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason C.,"I had high expectations because of the ratings. However, the food was really disappointing.
We ordered a Thai iced tea(5/5)
Pad Thai(3/5) too sweet
Panang beef(1/5) beef way over cooked and the rice was dry as bones
Tom yum soup(2/5) way too salty
Service were alright. The place is super busy and crowded with loud music.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sylvie L.,"Service was amazing and staff were knowledgeable, saw them clean tables between customers which is great. Tables were distanced appropriately and their patio still felt cute and cozy.
Food was delicious and surprisingly filling because the portions did not seem very large at first glance. I ordered the khao soi with beef. The brisket was very tender but didn't have much taste to it, the real winner was the broth.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ileana T.,Delicious food and a great ambiance but get there early because they will sell out of a few things by then end of the night.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James H.,"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is known for its authentic Northern Thai cuisine, which often includes bold flavors and unique combinations of ingredients. Many customers appreciate the restaurant's dedication to providing an immersive dining experience that transports them to the vibrant streets of Thailand.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Louise E.,"The constant line ups for this place made it so appealing. We went on a Tuesday around 7 and waited for about 20 minutes which wasn't bad at all. With all the hype, I guess my expectations were pretty high and unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to the hype.
We started with the spring rolls with glass noodles inside. Super yummy and probably our favourite bite out of everything we had. My boyfriend and I then shared 3 dishes - papaya salad, pad thai beef, and the morning glory.
The presentation of the papaya salad was absolutely beautiful. The chicharron was a nice crunch on the side, but overall the flavours were quite muddled and the dish lacked any freshness. The pad thai was a bit dry and the sauce was very heavy on the oyster sauce which totally overpowered everything and just took on a one-note flavour profile. Morning glory is one of my favourite veggies and despite the decent flavour, the vegetable was overcooked. With such a delicate and tasty veggie, I wished it was done justice since it's such a rare dish to come across.
I'll definitely be back to try their other dishes and hopefully, I'll find some dishes to fall in love with.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susan L.,"3.5-4 
Came about 30 minutes before closing and it was still pretty busy. Music is loud, and so are people so it's a bustling place. Our server was nice and came to check on us every now and then, seemed like she was both hostess and server taking orders.
Menu is straightforward, sectioned off by appetizers, curries, noodles and specialities. We went with the ones that were most mentioned on yelp! 
All the meat is seasoned and cooked well (the beef is braised in the green curry, the chicken is tender in the khao soi and the beef is pan fried deliciousness in the pad Thai).
As for the taste- green curry has a bit more kick in it, the khao soi curry is TO DIE for (so good!), and the pad Thai is a bit on the sweeter side.
Spent about 70 CAD for 3 dishes, a bit on pricier end but worth it.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chelsea S.,"Came on a Thursday evening around 5 and the restaurant was already starting to get packed! I love the atomosphere here and the decor! The staff were nice and helpful. Their menu isn't as selective as other thai restaurants i'm used to but they have great selections! We got the sausage, papaya salad, pad ga prao, and khao soi. 
I really enjoyed the sausage and the sauce that came with it. The papaya was good too and i liked how they included all the extras i usually eat with it at home like lettuce, noodles, crab chips, and fried pork skin! The khao soi was a bit different than what i'm used to since i usually eat it with rice noodles but it was decent. The pad ga prao was really good! Lots of flavors and by the end of our meal, our plates were all clean! I looked around and saw the tables around us has emptied their plates completely too. The total was about $80.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve H.,"Great food and fantastic service.  It gets very crowded.  Don't expect to get seated right away.  We had about a 45 min wait but it was well worth it.  I'd recommend the Khai Soi, Khao Pla Tawt, and the Pad See Eew. All great dishes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie C.,"Came here on a Sunday night and to our luck there was a short waiting time. After reading all the glowing reviews to this place I had this on my list as a must go to place when I'm in Toronto. My friends and I decided to do family style got the following to share:
Spring Rolls ($8.50 CAD): This was a great appetizer to share amongst the 4 of us. This came with mushrooms, glass noodles, carrots and served with a sweet and spicy Thai chili sauce. I liked how they didn't skimp out on the filling in the spring rolls and it was nicely paired with the sauce.
Khao Soi ($16.50 CAD): Don't skip out on this dish! This was extremely rich in flavor and the egg noodles were perfectly cooked. The texture of the crispy noodles paired well with everything in this dish. It kept me wanting more!
Gaeng Kiaw Wan ($17.50 CAD): The green curry was just alright. It's served in a coconut which is super creative however, I felt as if this dish was a bit bland. We ordered this dish with tofu, which could be the reason as to the lack of flavors.
Pad Gra Prow ($16.50 CAD): There wasn't anything special to this dish. We ordered this with the crispy pork and was disappointed to find that the pork wasn't crispy and was actually quite soggy. It made it hard to chew because of how soggy it was.
Sadly, I had a mediocre experience and left feeling disappointed with the food. The service was lacking and it took some time to flag someone down to take our order.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adriano N.,"65/100
Really good Thai food, no complaints but from what I have had before it's also run of the mill.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna G.,"OMG YUM!
My boyfriend brought me and my parents here for dinner after a theatre show. The ambiance is so cute, but a little loud (my mom didn't like that, but everyone else was fine). I loved the story of the restaurant told in polaroids when you walk in. 
We ordered a grabong app to share and I had the khao soi with tofu. Both dishes were amazingly delicious! I think the price was fair for the location, food quality and portions. Our bill came to $92 (without tip) for 4 entrees and 1 app. Would highly recommend this place! I think they are on Skip the Dishes or UberEats too.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Abben H.,"A group of friends and I visit Toronto annually in July and we've been trying to get a reservation to Pai for the last 3 years. It's always been fully booked over 1-2 months out, but this year we finally made it to lunch! I was always inspired by Pai's history and how they started the restaurant, so I was really excited to taste the food.
The inside feels stylish, hip, and authentic. The atmosphere is pretty dim especially since it's in the basement level so there isn't much natural light. We were immediately seated at a long bar-height table. For drinks we all got the thai milk-tea which was really refreshing.  For appetizers, we got the grabong (really crispy and great to share!) and kung tawt. 
For entrees, people at our table ordered the Khao Soi, Pad Gra Prow, Green Curry, and Pad Thai. I got the Khao Soi with beef and farang spice, and I think it was my favorite by far. The golden curry soup base was super creamy and rich in flavor. At first I wish there was more, but by the end I was really full and satisfied (maybe still wish there were some extra noodles). The included fried noodles on top added the perfect amount of texture to the braised beef and soup dish. I tried my friend's Pad Thai and to be honest, I wasn't super impressed by it -- it seemed to be overly salty and lacked some sweetness and sourness. Regardless, this is my best and favorite Thai restaurant I've been to and it met my expectations and more!  The staff are super friendly and give really good recommendations.  
MAKE A RESERVATION AND GO EAT, you won't be disappointed.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James T.,"Meeting a friend after 20 years and he suggested we meet @pai , never heard of the place .
Landed at 7:15pm and it was a dry lane and it's in the basement floor , but as you enter u r shocked to see the place is huge like 200 plus seater and fully packed and u have a 1 hr waiting on a Tuesday ....oooou !
We were given a pager and suggested we could wait in the waiting area where they offer beverage sales and we ordered some ipa .
After 45 minutes we got the place to sit on the bar counter where we ordered their favourite squash bites and chicken satay . The place was nice energetic n staff was pleasant !
For main course I ordered massaman beef with steamed rice and my friend ordered green curry which was served in a raw coconut , exciting to see .
The food tasted authentic n delicious!
Coming back soon to experience another vibrant evening !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pooja P.,"Should I even have to tell you how good Pai is? Aren't 2K and counting reviews enough lol
And yeah true to it's amazing rating Pai doesn't ever disappoint.
Been here a few times over the years and haven't once been disappointed nor has the taste changed.
Always get their sangria which has some delicious lychees! Another favourite of mine is the Grabong or squash fritters. They come with this delicious tangy dipping sauce!
Have tried their noodle bowl, pad Thai, green curry, fish plate and on my last visit tried the red curry and as usual wasn't disappointed.
Dessert was the mango and sticky rice which was heavenly! The fried banana is also excellent.
Wait staff are great, super attentive and caring. Answer all questions and provide recommendations.
A must visit if you are in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tracy T.,"Yum! I ordered the Khao Soi with braised beef and I was delightfully surprised. The waitress said it was standardized to a ""medium"" spice level so I was pretty skeptical at first, but then she further reassured me that it wasn't too spicy and it turned out great! I'm glad I listened to her because I really enjoyed it! The curry was very creamy and flavorful with a sweet undertone, and the chunks of braised beef were fairly large and tender. The crispy noodle topping also added a great crunchy texture to the overall dish. 
It was a filling and yummy meal! I just felt that the music was too loud because I had to scream to talk over the small table and I could barely even hear myself.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diana X.,"I'm okay with long waits if the food was worth it, but from what we ordered, it was decidedly not. 
We didn't have a reservation and the place was packed New Years Eve around 5 pm. We waited at the bar and ordered a thai iced tea to pass the time. It was overly sweet and lacked flavor/tasted watered down. 
We were seated at a shared table with another party. Fair enough, but the wait was long, and we struggled to flag down a waiter to refill our waters.
Finally, the food. I'd read a bunch of Yelp reviews and pored through photos while we waited and eventually settled on the pad gra prow. My boyfriend got the panang curry with fish.
The pad gra prow was mediocre to the point that I could not finish it despite being hungry. I paid extra for crispy pork, which turned out to be borderline crispy ground pork that was under-seasoned and extremely dry. This was plated on a bed of rice, equally dry, and a serious lack of sauce to rescue the scenario.
The fish panang was excellent though - rich and flavorful curry, flaky fish. That, as well as the currently favorable USD rate, tempered the experience for me.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chastity C.,"Mouthwateringly good food! Is that even a word lol? Regardless, this restaurant served my hungry self and I ate and left no crumbs! My daughter Britannica, 13, also recommends it here and claims it's her favorite restaurant! Coming back asap!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Todd G.,"We were vacationing in Toronto and we're looking for something different for dinner. we took an Uber to this place and they were able to accommodate our party of 10.
I've only had pad Thai once before and I was familiar with it but I wasn't sure if the kids were going to enjoy it as much as I did.
You reminded me of someone's basement cuz it kind of actually was in the basement but it was decorated as such. The chairs were the same chairs that you said and when you were in high school I thought it was pretty neat how they repurposed furniture.
It wasn't too loud but it was very crowded and the I ordered chicken pad Thai I kind of wish they would have brought me chopsticks to eat it with but I didn't ask for it so there's that. They also accommodated the kids by making them chicken fried rice which was not on the menu but they made it anyway which I thought was really cool.
portion sizes were very good drinks were refilled almost instantly overall very good job.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clark C.,"We ordered the Moo ping skewers, one of which was raw inside. They replaced it, but my pregnant wife already had a bite which ruined the rest of the meal.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shahan S.,Ambiance alone gives this place a double thumbs up. Pair that with amazing food and excellent service and you get the 5 star trifecta,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nancy O.,Best Thai in the city hands down. Vibe at the downtown location is better but always a line up to get in so if you don't have reservations your best bet will be the uptown location.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Abigail D.,"I've always ordered Pai from Uber eats and still one of my favourite Thai places in Toronto! I has a great reputation for a reason. Since it is a very popular place, get there early for a table. We ordered the Northern Thai platter which was great for sharing for 2 people. It's a dine in option only.  Everything in the platter is delicious and a fun thing to try something new.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Selyna K.,"Pai
I AM DEFINITELY GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE!
Found this place thru google and decided a try because of the reviews. 
I ordered the famous curry and i was a bit disappointed because it wasn't in a coconut shell as how they advertised it (could've added some presentation). But also im glad I got it because it was one of the BEST CURRY I've tried my entire life!!! It comes with a rice bowl too!
We also ordered a soup i forgot what it was called but it has some strong flavour on it which made it a little bit too much. It also has nuts which im not really a fan of. 
Service was fast. Place is cool!! Staff are really kind :)
Please you need to try their curry",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Billy L.,"Would highly recommend Pai for thai lovers. It's a must try for anyone who hasn't been before. One piece of advice, get here early. The line up  is insane and I completely understand why.
Lucky, we got a table after work on a Friday night without any issues. By the time we were finisehd around 7:30, close to 8. The line up was out the door.
The vibe of the restaurant is amazing, lots of energy and smells amazing as soon as you walk in. The restaurant itself is pretty biog with lots of seating. Really cool mom and pop shop feel, the food definitely is the highlight.
We got the pad thai, chicken wings, thai ice tea, fried rice and khao soi. Hands down, the best thai meal that i've ever had. There was so much flavour in each dish, the pad thai was perfect. Noodles were perfectly cook, the peanut garnish and lime wedge to add that citrus taste. BOMB.
Chicken wings and fried rice were also unreal. You can really taste the breath of the wok in this dish. I can't explain it but there's a hint of char in the dish that adds an extra element. I'm so hungry right now!
I'd suggest the thai ice tea also, some places make this overly sweet, but not Pai. definitely worth it!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine S.,The service was good but I don't know what was happening with the lunch last week. I got a beef Gaeng Panang and the beef was rubbery and dry and tasted as if it was left out for a while. My friend also ended up getting a stomachache after (the same dish but vegan version) which lasted for days. We don't know if it was from the food because she eats spicy curries often and this was a first. At least my other friend's rice dish was good,2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer B.,"PAD GRA PROW - currently my favorite authentic Thai dish in Toronto. 
I typically get the beef version with mild spice.  Tastes as close to anything that I had while in Thailand - 100% recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angel C.,"Mmmm....
From open to close, there's almost ALWAYS a line up from the hostess to the entrance door all the way up the stairs, and sometimes to the sidewalk. My advice? Come earlier than your scheduled time, and be prepared to wait!
There's gotta be a reason why there's a wait, ALL the time. 
It's simply because THEIR FOOD IS FANTASTIC! 
The restaurant has a casual ambience, and traditional decor, makes you feel like you're having authentic street food in Thailand. 
Server is with you right away, orders come super fast, and they're always prepared the very same way, every single time. My favourite my far will always be their Khao Soi  but all their dishes are worth a try!
Ever since I visited here for the very first time a few years ago, I haven't stopped bringing my friends here that's never tried it before. So if you ask me... I say COME AND TRY IT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arthur James L.,"Roaming around downtown Toronto and get hungry , decided to grab something nice for dinner , yelp introduce me to here at Pai Northern Thai Kitchen , it was full pack but have the chance to grab there best pad thai on the menu and it was delish , staff are courteous and kind , leaving the place with a full tummy and a big smile !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex J.,"Definitely a place to go. This is Thai restaurant. 
I'll start by the toilets which are very Clean (with capital letter). I'm use to hear that if toilets are clean, then the food must be clean as well.
I definitely live this place and will go again to try others things. I've try the p plum cocktail with ginger beer and vodka. You don't feel so much alcohol in the there and its refreshing. A nice cocktail for hot summer though.
As a plate I took a salad plate that were very spicy. I didn't really like it because it was too spicy but my bad, I didn't read well the color as advices.
But I loved at the others plates and honestly I can't understand if you don't like it. It's not so expensive and the atmosphere is very nice. A bit hippie style with disco music :) just one comment, take are too close to each other and it's a bit noisy.
Make sure you have a reservation of you go around 7pm.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jasmine L.,"Came here at 8pm on a Friday night and only waited 10 minutes for a table of 3! And the food took ~20 min to come.
GREEN CURRY WITH BEEF (5/5)- l really enjoyed the bamboo shoots, the medium spiciness was perfect, and I loved that it was served in a coconut! Scraping off the coconut meat into the rich sweet green curry gave a chewy component and an added coconut taste to the already delicious coconut-based curry. There was ~9 generous chunks of beef that was tender and moist. 
CHICKEN PAD THAI (5/5)- The perfect sweet and sour savoury combo. It had a great amount of chicken, noodles, and bean sprouts that were cooked & infused with just the right amount of sauce so it JUST coated. Topped over were peanuts,  green onions, and a refreshing shredded cabbage. The noodles were thin & flat and had a slightly firm chew. 
KHAO SOI WITH BEEF (4.5/5)- They gave a good amount of fried noodles along with the normal noodles that were soaked in the amazingly coconut sweet & savoury red curry. I would've drank it all if I wasn't sharing it haha! There was also a generous amount of beef chunks that were tender and juicy.
After hearing so many good things about the authenticity and food at Pai, I'm so happy I got to finally try it out (with a short wait time too!). I'm sure I'll be back again soon :)",5

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sam L.,"Hands down the best Thai outside of Thailand and maybe I'll go so far as to say even better than that in Thailand... If you're visiting Toronto and only have time to eat at one place? This is it. 
We were seated at the bar around 6:00pm Friday. There will be a wait but not too long. 
Food:
Kao Soi: 6/5... this dish was phenomenal. The fresh thin noodles combined with the addictive curry coconut soup... I couldn't get enough. I chose chicken thighs per staff recommendation and it definitely was tender and flavorful. 
Pad Thai: 5/5. Bae got this dish Thai Spicy as a challenge and he was challenged indeed. But the fire didn't build which was great. 
Spring rolls: 5/5. Crunchy. Who knew vegetarian spring rolls could taste this good... 
Service: Attentive & so friendly!
Decor: The vibes do transport you back to Thailand! Very cute and pretty big space. 
Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Toronto. MUST GO.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maheen H.,Amazing food but there's always a wait and it's always more than an hour and even though the food is worth it I think they should offer more tables for reservations in advance!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason A.,"Went here on a Friday night for dinner with my girlfriend and her cousin. Originally we were expecting a very long wait because we were warned at how popular this place gets, especially on a Friday evening. Apparently they recently expanded the dining area which was great news to hear! We were seated right away and the waitress came about 5 minutes after being seated to ask if we had any questions about the menu. We had previous recommendations on the food here from some friends and one of the people we were with, so it didn't take long for us to know what we wanted. 
If you have not tried Thai iced tea before, it is a must try pair with your dinner! For food, we tried the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken with mild spice (soooooo good with a great portion), Gai Satay chicken skewers with sticky rice (beautifully presented), and the pad gra prow with fried pork (DELICIOUS!). 
All the food came in about 30 minutes, which was great considering how busy they were. Plus, with good company, time goes by faster! 
Overall, i would give this place 6 stars if it was an option. Great experience and even better food and service. Thank you, Pai for always making me crave your food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sunaina M.,"I called this place 3 days in advance and found that I couldn't get a hold of anyone given that all directions the machine sent me to were automated. It directed me to make a reservation online and I shortly after (late at night) received a notification that they did not have ANY tables for me that day (Friday night). I walked in 2 hours in advance on the day of (5:00pm) and got in the long line up. Got to the front and I was told the person that it was my cousin's 30th, it would be a surprise and therefor needed a table at a secluded spot and that I needed to come back at 7:30pm (30 minutes before my requested time). *It was a table for 4 we were requested not a table for 10. 
I came back at 7:30pm and got a table in a place right across the restaurant where I knew the birthday girl would see me from miles away. We didn't get a table in a secluded spot as requested. She of course saw us from a mile away .... womp womp. It wasn't a surprise when her jaw dropped from the entrance. 
Appetizer:
Vegetarian Spring Rolls were good. Plenty to keep two people good for appetizers. The fish sauce goes beautifully with it. 
Main Course: 
Panang Curry. I requested that this be as spicy as possible and was told that the curry was as it came and we couldn't request for a higher spice level. Unfortunate. They brought us a house-made oil (which was not spicy) but it made the dishes take A LOT better. I also was brought chopped thai chillies which was nice. I asked this to be vegetarian and was brought a vegan dish. I returned this to get my dish brought to me some time later while all the other guests at my table were eating. Also remember to ask for a separate plate for this dish as the curry bowl is filled up and so is the white rice bowl - leaving no room for you to put them together to eat. 
Dessert:
We had one of the two ice cream options. Can't remember the name of the option I chose...think it started with a G. It wasn't great at all. The taste may grow on you the more you eat it but definitely not something many people would look forward too. 
They didn't fall short of bringing the birthday girl ice cream (not free of cost) and singing Happy Birthday to her as a group. 
4 people with 2 appetizers and 4 individual main courses = approx. $120.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole T.,"Whenever I crave Pad Thai, this is the place to go! I have been to many Thai restaurants and I can say that Pai makes the best Pad Thai I have ever tasted!! I love the food, atmosphere and service. Everything is amazing and definitely worth your money.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeremy S.,"There are only a few Thai places in North America that will actually give Thai hot to white people. You can beg and plead and explain your love of hot food (we grow chiles and I have worked for a hot sauce company), but the kitchen will be all, ""Nope, they can't handle it."" And then I'm sad and disappointed and threaten to sneak some Dave's Insanity Sauce in my pocket next time. But Pai's pad Thai made me suffer a little, and that's worth five stars on its own, and now I'll go to the place every time I'm ever in Toronto until the end of time, which should be a few times even though I live in Buffalo.
Beyond that, the appetizers made you rethink what could be done with fried shrimp and spring rolls, the decor is adorably kitschy, the service (we sat at the bar) was excellent, and there was an eclectic Christmas market going on on the middle of the dining room. Pai somehow blends basement dive, sports bar, and semi-upscale Thai food semalessly, and if making the food legit Thai hot hadn't already earned them five stars in my book, pulling off the latter trick would have.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sabrina T.,"The high rating is well deserved. Pai is just delicious Thai food plain and simple. I've been a few times, it's always packed. The ambience is rustic and nice. It's kind of a basement but it's a big open space with cute lighting, good vibe but still pretty cozy. It's busy without being overwhelming. The service is really efficient considering how busy they are. 
I had their green curry which comes in a coconut - honestly I was enticed by that just for the look but it's also a young coconut and you can scrape off the coconut meat! The grabong app is really great to share. It's really like French fries made from squash- really nice. I had their rotating tap beer which I can't recall but was great
This is definitely must try place in Toronto. I'm glad they continue to go strong. If it were closer to me I would definitely be a regular.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine H.,"I loved ""The Story of Pai"" which was posted in multiple locations throughout the restaurant. The just of it is that a Canadian man went on a trip to Northern Thailand, ended up meeting his future wife and moved with her back to Canada. Chef Nuit and her husband opened several restaurants with the goal of duplicating authentic Thai cuisine. 
When we arrived on a weeknight the line was out the door, but once we made it to the host stand our wait was only about 15 minutes. 
The menu is very thoughtful - some of the traditional Thai dishes such as Pad Thai and Tom Yum Shrimp and others that I had not seen before. 
I can see why the place is so popular - the flavors were outstanding in the handful of dishes we were able to sample!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linda Z.,"Probably don't need more convincing that Pai is good with near 7k Google reviews at 4.6 stars.
It made an ideal late lunch spot and flavors were bold and punch-y. We were seated immediately and the late afternoon crowd was relaxed. We ordered Spring Rolls, Papaya Salad, Pad Cha Hett and Khao Soi, but truly everything that came out of the kitchen smelled and looked delicious.
Go here!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anshika A.,"We loved the usual chicken pad thai and warm service. 
The atmosphere ws electric and there was so much joy. 
This place is always busy but they will try to accommodate you as soon as possible.
Must go place if you like thai food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alicia C.,Such a great place for Thai food. The khao soi with beef brisket is my go to! So flavourful and the portion size is enough for two meals or to split between two people.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel M.,"A friend asked me what do I miss most about Toronto since having moved to London, ON and Pai is what immediately came to mind. Their Penang Beef Curry is life! So so so GOOD!
I also am not a lover of Pad Thai but their's is awesome. So is their Pad Gra Pow, their Spring Rolls,and their Gaeng Masaman. I think the only thing I have tried and not loved is their Green Curry, which to me was a bit on the loose/oily side.
I used to work 5 minutes from this place and the odd time I could get a reservation (which is rare because this place is almost always packed) I would go. I have been spoiled and no thai food quite compares to the deliciousness that is Pai. Not in Toronto at least and certainly nothing in London, ON.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley Y.,"When you work in the financial district and have an hour lunch break, trying new restaurants becomes such an easy and convenient past time (especially if you forget your lunch at home). I've always tried going to Pai for dinner, but it gets so packed and doesn't seem worth an hour plus long wait. So there I was, deciding that Pai would become my next lunch break endeavour. 
Pai opens at 11:30am on a Friday and a coworker and I rushed to get here just before 12, which was a good thing because it was already so packed when we arrived. We managed to get the last two seats at the bar, but it felt like they just stuck us in the corner right next to everyone else waiting to get a seat. I ordered the green curry with fish and was so excited to receive my food in a coconut (just like all the other yelp reviews indicated), but was so disappointed when it came in a plain white bowl. The flavours were there, but it tasted like the same flavours I could get at any thai takeaway place and didn't seem like any overly special dish. Not to mention, it took about 40 mins for our food to arrive which didn't leave us much time to eat. 
Their food is quite decent and the restaurant's vibe is super chill, but I wouldn't rate this higher than any other competent thai restaurant out there.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jie L.,"I tried 3 things at Pai: beef salad, spring rolls, and pad thai. I'm visiting Toronto for work, and everyone in the office had hyped this place up. I mean it's Yelp reviews also look pretty strong. I walk in, the place was pretty packed. We got a table for our party of 6. It took them a while to take our order because it was a busy place. They got my order wrong. I ordered spicy pad thai and it came out with no spice. I do have to say, they provide pretty good service, but I was not too impressed with their food. With that said, I also have to say, I have really high standards for thai. I would recommend this place, but just know that it is a bit over hyped.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lindsay R.,"Pai was very busy when we arrived (around 5:40 pm), but that was expected as it's known that this restaurant is very popular. We walked around 20 minutes and were served almost right away. I ordered the khao soi with beef brisket and it came out relatively quickly and nice and hot. It was absolutely delicious - the broth was rich and creamy, the brisket was so tender and flavorful, and the mix or soft and crunchy noodles made for a unique experience! Even the restaurant itself is adorable with the family's story on the wall, tons of pictures, fun lighting and decor, and a map of Pai. Now I want to go to Thailand even more than before!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Parker B.,"I was recommended this by many friends upon moving to Toronto, and after going I can see why. I got their pad Thai with chicken and holy this pad Thai was one of the best ones of my life (given that I have never been to Asia..). Like I almost don't even want to try anything else from their menu because I just want to keep goi back for their pad Thai. Generous portion size as well. My friend got the green curry and also really enjoyed it, apparently it also has a good kick, so looking forward to MAYBE straying from my new favourite dish to try this next.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aya N.,"Loved this place so much that we came here twice during our stay in Toronto. 
First time we visited here was Saturday late afternoon for late lunch with 6 ppl including 3 vegan friends and they were very accommodating for our request. I also love the fact you get to choose how spicy you would like. Sometimes I can't eat certain dishes cuz it's too spicy but no issue here and it tells me they cook fresh for you. The place looked crowded when we walked in first but the wait wasn't too bad. All dishes we tried were super fresh and tasty. I also loved their cocktail. 
We came back 2 days later cuz it was sooooo good! My favorite dish was papaya salad but I also loved my drink, Tea mac. If you like Thai ice tea, you need to try this. 
Solid Thai place with cute and welcoming atmosphere and great service. I will come back for sure.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy G.,"Food is always great the service was always bad. I would order takeout, but refuse to go dine in",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vincent H.,"Strongly recommended by literally everyone that's tried this place, I expected Pai to be an overhyped experience before I stepped into their door. I ended up being wrong on so many levels.
Right after walking down the steps to this basement Toronto restaurant, I was greeted by an authentic, unique, and trendy decor that was like no other place I've seen. It was so noisy and welcoming!
What really wowed me though, was their food. I decided to try just their chicken chef nuit pad thai with farang spicy today, and it was the most incredible pad thai I've ever had. The chicken was perfectly cooked and came in large chunks, and all the noodles were so soft and tender; it just all melted in my mouth as I chewed through them! It tasted so good, with just the right amount of everything. 
I asked for hot sauce too, and they gave me a chili oil hot sauce instead of that awful chili-garlic-sriracha-like substance that all the other places give. Chili oil is genuinely spicy, and only helped augment the flavours of the pad thai.
After this experience, I can safely say I'm definitely joining the Pai recommenders crowd; it's just too good to not pass up. Definitely get reservations when coming here though, it's always too busy if you arrive closer to peak hours.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bernadette W.,"Unfortunately, I'm in Toronto for work on my birthday. I'm tired af and trying to find a restaurant not too far from my hotel. I go to a few but those places are pretentious as hell. Not what I'm looking for tonight. I check Yelp and find Pai. I get there about 5:15, get a seat at the bar. By 5:30 it's PACKED. Since it's my birthday, I decide I'm going to drink what I want and sample whatever catches my eye eye on the menu.
I sit at the bar and start with a shot of tequila (the shot of the day) and a Summer Dog. The server/bartender seemed very friendly and was like like, "" Yaaaaaas. Good start."" Food- I start with the wings. The drink is good (could be stronger but that's why I got the shot), the wings -OMG delicious. The sauce on the side is absolutely unnecessary. I also get a papaya salad. I wish I could order it without all the extras. When the papaya salad was brought to me, the server asked if I've ever had it before. Why? Is there a secret way to eat it? The question was kind of strange to me so I had to flex and let him know I had been to Thailand about 10 times in the past year.
The papaya salad while good, the dried shrimp were inedible. They were so hard I couldn't even break them with my teeth. The noodles on the side are unnecessary. I had already asked them not to bring me the pork rinds and I only ate a few of the shrimp chips-they are pretty unnecessary as well.
After I ordered those two the server took my food menu. I wasn't done ordering yet. I ordered another shot and another summer dog and enjoyed the music. The music was absolutely phenomenal! I really could have stayed all night listening to the music.
Since the Khao Soi got rave reviews I wanted to order that as well. The server seemed annoyed. Not sure why as I was a quiet client and spending a lot of money in this place. Anyway I got the Khao Soi and another Summer Dog. The Khao Soi (with chicken) was absolutely delicious. It was really more than I could eat but like I said, I decided to sample whatever I wanted. I finished the Summer Dog and asked the server to prepare my food for take away. If I'm ever in Toronto again (I doubt it) I would definitely come back here. And I will recommend it to anyone that I know.
Very good start to my night.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer J.,"Simply put......I want to move to Toronto and live above Pai so I could eat their perfect pad kra prao every day for the rest of my life.  Perfect from the addition of thai style fried egg, nam prik nam pla sauce, and slices of cucumbers on the side.  I ate in silence, each bite better than the last.  This belly filling meal got me through the rest of my very long day.  
This place is packed though, and from what I understand it's packed at all time and most times you have to wait for a table.  IT IS WORTH THE WAIT.  
Service was super friendly - atmosphere casual and fun.
I'm planning a trip back to Toronto soon, and who would blame me that Pai is the central part of the itinerary!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Donna N.,This is my favourite place for pad thai! Honestly it seems like a simple noodle dish but Pai hits the spot with the perfect tamarind seasoning for their pad thai. I did have take out for their khao soi and I prefer it better as a dine in dish.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle T.,"My family visited Pai on a Saturday night, they ordered take out for me. 
I tried the chicken pad Thai (mild), fried shrimps, and chicken fried rice. 
All the items were AMAZING! I never had real Thai food in Toronto, only tried it in San Francisco. 
The pad Thai flavour was something I never tried before, the noodles were so soft. The chicken fried rice didn't look like it had much flavour since it was really white in colour, but it was the best fried rice I ever had! The shrimp was also not over cooked, the coating around the shrimp was yummy! 
The food was not super hot but it was amazing, I can't wait to dine in and enjoy it fresh!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lilly H.,"The food was pretty good, wait was long, thai iced tea and grabong were excellent,  shout out to Colin the best waiter I've had in a Toronto!!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Craig R.,Visiting from out of town and found this place by accident. My wife and I both like Thai so thought we should try. Food was just excellent. Sorry I don't live closer or I'd be spending a lot of time here.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark Y.,"Come here for delicious Thai food and a kick a$$ vibe. Be prepared for high energy and high quality food...not a place to come if you want to have a nice conversation with your significant other, because, honestly, the awesome tunes that they are blasting on the many speakers through this basement level joint is going to be far more enjoyable.
We ordered the kung tawt (deep fried tiger prawns with thai chilli sauce), the Khao soi with chicken (noodles in golden curry) and the Chef Nuit pad Thai with shrimp. Every dish was superbly satisfying, and we wished we had more room to try some of the other curries.  Good selection of drinks as well, and great servers.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vidya P.,"I Have nothing but WONDERFUL things to say about this place! Happened to chance upon this place and were so glad we did. The wait was long but so, so worth it. We were in love with the place before we even walked in - and let me tell you - once our table was called - we couldn't believe how big the restaurant was! So much more than meets the eye at first glance. All the servers - from the front end to the back - were sweet and courteous and so helpful with their suggestions. We ordered the pad Thai and Pad Thamada - and it was such a subtle yet flavorful first bite that we couldn't wait to devour the rest! The drinks were also so yummy and strong. Totally worth the visit and we can't wait to be back soon!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alister L.,"One of my friends brought me here and I am so glad she did!  I am a big Thai cuisine lover and this definitely had me satisfied and more.  We didn't have a reservation so we just did walk-ins for lunch.  There were a lot of people waiting but we didn't wait that long for a table of 2.  I  think we waited around 30 minutes.  The space itself is pretty lively.  There is a bar and lots of tables.
I got the green curry.  You get to pick what kind of protein you want with the curry so I got chicken with my green curry.  The curry was not too sweet or too spicy.  Definitely a good balance.  What I loved most about it was that the curry came in a coconut!  I would definitely come back to try the other dishes when I am back in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paola A. P.,"Amazing food! To busy all the time is better if you make a reservation.
Nice service!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley Z.,"Last time we came we waited over 40 minutes to get a table so you know I made sure to get online reservations weeks in advance. We were sat at the back corner all the way in the place (didn't even know the restaurant was so huge?!?!) so the lighting wasn't the best but made for a very cosy dinner (shout-out to the people who sat next to us for not minding those few seconds we took pics with cellphone lighting lol) 
We started with the very popular squash fritters and finished the appetizer within minutes because that sauce is just fabulous! For mains two of us had the Khao Soi with braised beef and the other had green curry. For drinks we had beer, the Thai Ice Tea, and the Dazed and Confused. Personally, even though the flavour was amazing and creamy, the Thai Ice was way too sweet, but the Dazed and Confused was both beautifully presented and tasted the best! Highly recommend! The portions seem small at first since the bowls are huge but we were stuffed by the end AND had leftovers! Also we always love the presentation of the green curry as it comes in a coconut! TOO CUTE. 
The atmosphere inside the restaurant is warm and welcoming. The staff are beyond nice and super patient when we asked about their drinks menu and always came to check up on us even though we were in the way back corner. 
Also, the decor, including the board of the PAI Toronto Story is so adorable, so when you're waiting check out the cute decorations and the framed pictures. 
Can't wait to come back soon!",4

Meal: Dinner
Dining Style: Dine-in
Would I Return: Yes
Ordered:
-Shrimp Chef Nuit Pad Thai ($18.50)
Thoughts:
Unfortunately, this place doesn't take reservations, so go early as we did have to wait about 30 minutes for a table. This was also on a weekday, so I can't imagine how busy they get on weekends. Luckily, they let us wait in the bar. I ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with shrimp and really enjoyed it. Portions were good, they gave a lot of food and we were all starving so we finished ours. There weren't many shrimps but the overall flavours were amazing.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kate C.,"The food tasted fairly good, especially the beef noodle soup. Prices are a bit expensive but portions are fairly large. Just a bit too loud/crowded; not good for holding extensive conversations or a peaceful dinner. 
Also recommend reserving in advance because there was a line extending out the door. Food took over an hour to be served. Would not go again during such crowded hours.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gladys C.,"Delicious Thai food but it is super busy on weekends. I would recommend going early. Service is quick and friendly. Ambiance is ok, but a little bit loud inside.
I had the khao soi and beef curry. Both were absolutely delicious. I will definitely be returning to try more items.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex L.,"I've had lunch here a few times over the past few years and although it's always been packed, the food is delicious and authentic and the place is definitely trendy.
Most recently, I had the Khao Sai braised beef for lunch at the bar. The food came very quickly and the Khao Sai is braised in a sweet coconuty sauce with garlic, spices, etc. The ""broth"" is so good I can basically drink it and that I did. It also had these crunchy things on top that beautifully decorated it and always provided a neat textural experience when eating it.
The braised beef was out of this world soft, my only gripe with it were the pieces of the beef were a little too big and I wish they cut them up smaller. All in all - this one dish made for a filling lunch! I definitely look forward to trying more things next time I'm here!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Coco N.,"Craving for good Thai food, tried their restaurants a while ago and wanted to come back. This time I tried their pad Thai, thought would be a safe choice. The noodles has the right texture, it's chewy and it's not mushy. But overall taste was very blend.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sabrina L.,"I'll keep this short and sweet since there are many reviews on here that can get very in-depth. 
Pros:
-The Tom Yum Soup: perfectly balanced, flavourful & delicious. Hits all the right spots and delivers all the right flavours. Extremely good for a Thai restaurant in Toronto. The only way you will find better Tom Yum is if you fly over to Thailand to get it.
-The other food was good too but the Tom Yum Soup Stole the show. I don't remember what else we ordered because I just kept eating the soup. Ordered a bowl of rice to exclusively eat with the soup. 
Cons:
-Really, really, long wait times but worth it in the end. Get ready to wait around and grab a few drinks first if you are planning on coming here.
Summary: Worth the wait, get the Tom Yum Soup.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle k.,"overall: literally the best thai food i ever had! hundred percent worth the wait
menus: 
thai iced tea: 8/10
pad see ew with shrimp: 10/10 
green curry with chicken: 10/10",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela W.,"You know you've been to a place too often when your wifi on your phone automatically connected! That's me with Pai ;) 
I went to Pai again the other day and left completely satisfied with the food and everything. It was a crowded Sunday evening given that it was Father's Day. However, we were seated fairly quickly because we only had 2 people. I overheard in the lineup that some parties with more people were given a waitlist of 45-60min. Pai should definitely consider getting on the Yelp Waitlist feature.
For food, I stuck with my usual appetizer Grabong. It's so good and definitely hit the spot. How can you get tired of fried squash fritters?? Goodbye diet! 
For the mains, I wanted to venture to their other selections outside of my usual Khao Soi or Masaman Beef Curry. So I tried the Panang Curry with beef instead while my boyfriend got the masaman beef after my strong recommendations. The Panang Curry has a nice aroma and you can definitely taste the jasmine scent. The beef pieces are small sliced pieces rather than the braised chunky ones in the Masaman. Overall I liked it but I think it help to reaffirm my love for the Masaman Beef Curry.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristina Y.,"Wow this place is popular!! I got here on a Saturday morning exactly at 11:30am when they opened and there were already a handful of tables filled up. By 12pm, the restaurant was almost full. 
The decor gave me local Thailand vibes so the place looked like it was going to be authentic. 
I got the chicken pad thai and I guess I had super high expectations coming into this restaurant because of the reviews. Sadly, it didn't meet my high expectations. While the noodles were cooked very well, the use of oyster sauce was a bit overwhelming. 
For appetizers, the satay was average, but if there's anything you need to get, it's the breaded garlic shrimp!!! 
Overall, the food was good and I enjoyed my meal, but it didn't blow my mind like I had expected!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Casey H.,Awesome northern Thai food. Ordered the Kai Soy did not disappoint. Pared with a Sing Ha beer fantasti.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha C.,"4.5!
Wow! Standout Thai food in a busy, central  Toronto neighborhood. 
This is a really cool place, you find the sign and then walk downstairs and you are transported to Thailand. Very similar to some restaurants I actually went to when I was in Thailand, I felt that this experience was really authentic. From the atmosphere to the food, all the details equaled one really fun and delicious experience.
I went with the Khao Soi which I chose because of the many images of it on yelp and I wasn't disappointed. Everyone in our party was jealous of my beautiful golden curry with those crunchy egg noodles poking out. The broth is rich, sweet and deeply flavorful, I got through about half of the broth before succumbing to a food coma. I also tried a bite of the pad Thai, and it was delicious, however I'd definitely recommend the khao soi if I had to choose again. Someone else got the panang curry which looked wonderful but I didn't get a chance to try it. I loved the small and concise menu, there's no watered-down or fusion/Chinese food here, it's strictly and authentically Thai. 
Prices are quite reasonable, you'd be hard pressed to find a cheaper restaurant with that standard of food anywhere in the area. We didn't do any appetizers so our bill only came to $40 or so for two including tax and tip. 
The only reason for the 4.5 is the portion sizes. My khao soi was a good size, I couldn't finish just because the broth was so rich. There was also a good amount of the braised beef. The pad Thai was a bit small, both people who had it finished it fairly quickly and then were digging into my leftover khao soi. Maybe we should have gotten appetizers but I think they could have been a bit more generous with the noodles, given how inexpensive they are. But again, the prices are quite decent considering the area. 
Service was good, our water glasses were filled regularly and all the food arrived quickly. We arrived just before 6pm on Wednesday evening and were seated right away, but shortly after 6pm a massive line began to form. I would recommend getting here early if you want to avoid the wait! 
I absolutely loved the look of this place, it's colorful, funky and lively. It reminds me of being in Thailand which, I think, is really the goal of a Thai restaurant. Can't wait to come back to try some other dishes! I'll be dreaming of that Khao soi until then!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nora T.,"I just realised I forgot to review Pai Northern after visiting a few times over the years. It's definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in Toronto that caters the mainstream, while staying quite true to traditions. 
The first thing you will notice walking in... the scent. A mix of Jasmine rice and fish sauce? Waiting in the crowded bar area is a bit of a torture, but you can order drinks at the bar. During my recent visit I realized how insanely large this place is... don't be discouraged by the wait, tables are turned quite quickly. 
Here is a quick summary of the food:
Tom Yom soup: Super flavourful. The lime is strong and the shrimps are plump.
Wings: Just delicious, not too spicey
Grabong: shredded and fried sweet potato - a must! 
Green Thai Curry: Not my favourite here, to be honest. 
Panang Curry: Definitely prefer this over the green.
Khao Soi - I had my first Khao Soi here, and I was hooked.
All in all, you can't go wrong. My only gripe is the 20% gratuity that gets added to parties of 6 or more. I've seen up to 18% gratuity at other places and in my experience service is always poor when automatic-gratuity is in play. Although I am happy to say the staff at Pai Northern, during my recent visit were attentive, and deserving of a solid tip.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Blair S.,"Yum! Everything was so yummy!!!  We walked right in and go seated and served right away. We came in for a late lunch and split everything we got. 
My favorite thing was the Chicken Pad Thai! We got medium spice, this was not spicy at all. It was perfect! It had just the right amount of flavor and subtle kick. The portion size was also perfect. It was plenty for two to split (especially for lunch). This was a recommendation from a friend while we were visiting. Another amazing recommendation that I would love to pass along! 
There was a variety of items of the menu that I would have loved to try! I'll just have to try them on my next visit to Toronto!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melissa H.,"Food was great, very consistent with the quality. Best Pad Thai in Toronto. Great Margaritas!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dena M.,"I came here for the first time not too long ago, I was craving some Thai food and a friend suggested this place. We got the Chef Nuit Pad Thai, Panang Curry and Ginger beer. I personally love ginger beer so I was super happy they had some! 
The Pad Thai was amazing, full of great flavour and a big portion. I could tell why it was a favourite amongst those who dine there (according to my waiter). The curry was also very good, a nice consistency and had a lot of chicken and veggies in it. My favourite though was the Pad Thai!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sabrina M.,"Best Thai food in Toronto. I eat here at least once or twice a month. They make the perfect pad thai. Masaman curry and the minced chicken with rice ( forgot its thai name ) are delicious. And I always order the starter soup and spring rolls. Yum.
the vibe at pai just makes me happy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gui G.,"Good Thai food and friendly service in downtown Toronto. Get down the stairs and feel transported to a little part of Thailand. The decor is nice and charming, and service was efficient. Went on a Friday for lunch and the place was packed. Tried the Khao Pad Beef and the Masaman Curry - both delicious and paired well with a sangria and the Woodhouse lager. 
Recommended and would try again if in the area.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pamela R.,"I come here regularly as I love the food and the atmosphere. I recently went for the Tom Yum soup. Trust me this is the best Tom Yum soup in the city! They are generous on the shrimp portions and it has a spicier kick which I loved!!
I usually come here for the pad gra prow but now I'll have to order both platter on my future visits.
The service is excellent and the food is amazing!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Florence L.,"One of the few Thai restaurants in Toronto that's comparable to Thailand. This place has some spots available for online reservations but they prefer taking walk ins. So we tried to get there a little earlier to bypass the line. 
We arrived at 7pm (prime dinner time) and the line up was already out the door. But surprisingly, we were seated pretty quickly; waited for about 10 minutes. The service was quick and attentive which is great for a super busy place.
If you like spicy, you'll love their spicy levels here. Most Thai place isn't spicy but PAI can definitely bring on the heat. 
Best dish was the Shrimp Pad Thai, great heat and flavours. I would prefer it more if the noodles weren't stuck together. The chicken skewers were moist and tender. Papaya Salad was fresh and great with the shrimp chips. The Pad Gra's crispy pork was a bit hard and chewy. It kind of reminded me of chinese bbq roasted pork left overnight. Khao Soy was very rice and creamy. And the Tom Yum was a tad salty for me. 
But overall, great flavours and service. I'd say this is closest to Thailand.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Setu J.,"Top notch Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto. 
The pad Thai tastes very close to the ones on Bangkok streets. 
The place is always busy and the service is always fast and efficient. 
Nice interiors, courteous staff. 
Not a local but I come here on all my Toronto visits. 
Must go!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela G.,"One of my favorite places for Pad Thai. I personally think its the best in Toronto. The space is really cool and surprisingly large - they even have a lunch area where you can pick and choose different bases and sauces. 
My go-to is the Chicken Pad Thai with Spring Rolls. It's my favorite. The spring rolls have a great crunch and are filled with veggies and glass noodles and served with a sweet & spicy sauce. The Pad Thai is not overly sweet and you can taste the quality of the ingredients. 
I have eaten here a  number of times and will continue to eat here. 
Keep Eating,
Angela",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mellanie P.,"I've been here a couple times and it's still consistently good! I brought some first timers here and they really enjoyed the food. 
Ordered the Pad Thai, Masaman braised beef curry, and Khao Pla Tawt. Of course we also had to order the Thai iced tea! Everything is fairly priced, maybe with the exception of the Thai iced tea (only because I think $5 is more than I expected for it) 
Would recommend everything that we ordered! It's usually really hard to find a Thai place that uses braised beef for their Masaman curry, which I find makes a difference, which is why I always order it when I come here. The beef is so soft and good. The same goes for the Pad Thai, taste is on point! This is the first time trying the Khao Pla Tawt but honestly we loved it too. The fish was fried but it was still moist AND the sauces that it comes with are so good (one sweet and one spicy). 
Will continue to come here and eat the delicious food!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leslie D.,"Omg. The food is SO. GOOD. This was my first Thai food place - went with a group of people from work (like 30 of us, booked in advance). The service was great despite it being suuuuuuper busy on a Saturday night. Glad we had a reservation cuz there was a 30min wait outside. 
10/10 would recommend! Maybe go at an off-peak time if you don't want to wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina W.,"My favourite thai restaurant in Toronto! Gra bong (fried squash), Tom yum soup, and stir fry morning glory are my favourite appetizers. If you have more people who would like to try the soup, I suggest ordering the dinner portion to share, it comes in a hot pot which is neat.  
Dinner favorites are the pad gra pow with crispy pork and green curry chicken/shrimp. Make sure to add the crispy pork if you're a fan, it is extra cost but it is definitely worth it. The green curry is served in a coconut and extra sauce in a side bowl. 
Dessert I like the mango sticky rice. And they serve a great selection of pretty cocktails and beers on tap. 
I do find over the years the size has gotten a bit smaller but it's still delicious.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aileen J.,Papaya salad was super tasty.  It is just the right amount of spice to get the sweat glands going :) had the beef kao soy and chicken green curry. Both were good but should probably ordered something different as both dishes were really creamy.  The reservations are booked months in advance so try to drop by before the rush hour to get a seat.  Will be back to have some more of the papaya salad.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rohan K.,"Food was great. Both meat and vegetarian selections were fantastic. Staff were really nice and had great service. If you're coming from out of town, parking right outside of the restaurant was hard to find, but there is a parking garage around the corner.
Our order:
To start, we got the individual size of the Vegan Tom Yum, and an order of spring rolls. The Tom Yum was delicious and the spring rolls were great too. We also got the Pai Sangria and a Singha to drink. I personally like Singha, and it was exactly as expected. The sangria was really good as well. A bit sweet if you're not used to that level of  sweetness, but it's a sangria, so it's expected.
For mains, I got the Oxtail Gaeng Hunglay, and my wife got the Veggie Pad Thai. The oxtail was recommended to me by the staff and did not disappoint. The pad thai was great as well. Both were a fairly large quantity. Neither of us were able to finish the main courses, and got them packed. I found the rice that came with the Gaeng Hunglay wasn't enough for the amount of curry there was, but I had rice at home so it wasn't a problem. 
For desert we did the Coconut Sorbet. They warned us that it's a large portion, and they weren't wrong. I probably wouldn't get it again just because of the quantity, but the taste was definitely there.
We'll definitely be coming back to Pai!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shrek B.,"Honestly, this restaurant made me have the shits. I had explosive diarrhoea and my bum itches a lot. Its been days since I had this food yet, my tummy still turns. I had the chicken fat Thai and peanut furry curry. I can bet on my last bottom dollar thats been creeping from the anus of the couch that I will never be returning. 
Stay safe,
Shreky Baby.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gerald W.,"Came here for lunch on a Thursday about 12 noon.  The place was already packed.  Heard that this was a popular place.  I ordered the chicken Pad Thai mild.  It came served on a banana leaf on a plate.  Peanuts and cabbage salad were served on the side of the dish.  It had big slices of chicken.  It was delicious.  Probably will come back to try the other menu items like Thai fried rice.  If you are a group of six or more a 20% auto service charge will be added to your bill.  Read the fine print at the bottom of the menu.
At the back of the restaurant they have the Thai market. Here you can get one meat item & rice for $10.  No need to line up.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivian L.,"Best Thai food hands down!  Definitely one of the best thai food restaurants I have tried. 5 stars for quality of food, the vibe and the authenticity of the ambiance. 
Wait time:Came here on a weekday for an early dinner and still had to wait a good 25 minutes. The line was out the door and only grew longer as the time passed by. Try to make a reservation if possible. They will seat you in a waiting area where you can order drinks as well as appetizers before you are ready to be seated in the dining area.
Appetizers and drinks: Appetizers were some of the most delicious thai food I have ever had. 
Fried coconut shrimp: Quality shrimp that is lightly breaded in panko breadcrumbs and deep fried. When you bite into the shrimp, you can taste a hint of the coconut and other spices. The shrimp is fresh and soft. Definitely recommend this appetizer!
Satay Chicken: The meat is so tender and the peanut sauce that comes with it is not too heavy. Tastes great and I would probably try their chicken wings next time as well. 
Drinks: Ordered a Thai Mojito and a sake. I would probably skip on the mojito next time as it was pretty sugary. Sake pairs well with spicy food.
Main entrees:
The main entrees were also equally impressive. 
Thai (green) curry in Coconut: Really delicious curry and looks great as it is served warmed in a coconut. 
Stir fry ground beef with rice and fried egg: This was probably my favorite dish. Lots of different spices and flavours. Authentic thai food taste--I can't recommend this enough. 
Check this place out! They also sell shrimp chips by the bag for $5 dollars.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacqueline V.,"Ahh, the famous Pai! With almost 5 stars and over 1,000 reviews, you can't help but have high expectations. I don't really remember the names of the dishes, but hopefully you can connect two and two. Everything was quality made and the ingredients were fresh. 
Good
- The skewers were excellllent. Never had skewers done that way before. They were moist and tender and the flavour was subtle but very tasty. I would order this again in a heartbeat. 
- The sticky rice that came with each meal was really well done. 
- Beef salad was yummy. The cold salad mixed with the beef was a nice combination and the sauce had a bit of a kick but really complimented the dish.  Portion is not that large considering it's a salad, left with wanting more. 
- Thai milk tea was yummy but very sweet. I liked it but I had to water it down a little as it was very concentrated. 
- Presentation of the dishes felt very authentic and everything looked delicious. 
The Ok
- I ordered the main dish that has ground meat with a fried egg on top on a bed of rice. I was okay with this. Wasn't blown out of the water and it's unfair to compare, but I prefer the Vietnamese style of the rice/meat/egg combination. 
- I think it's my own bias, but I really did not enjoy the sausage appetizer. It was dry and the flavours were peculiar and not what I was used to. 
- We sat outside, but when we were waiting for a table, the interior was quite dark and cramped with tables and people almost touching each other. If you're able to, get on the patio with good weather. It's a great experience! 
All in all, really solid restaurant that gets packed in no time. My brother was sprinting to get the table we wanted and we had to have an early dinner at 5 pm. Shortly after that, the line spilled out into the streets with hungry patrons. Really recommended (but get a reservation). 4/5!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Albert A.,"Very good experience, nice food, pleasant experience, definitely a come back. Nice service and ambiance",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,A N.,"Good, authentic as usual.  Really like their green Thai curry. Staff is extremely friendly",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica H.,Fantastic Thai food! Everything we ordered was really good! Great service and ambiance!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roger E.,"They really should have a majority northern dishes if they want to be called a northern Thai restaurant. 
Way too many uninspired curries and phads all central Thai food and not great. 
The few northern bits like gai yang, Sai oua, and som tam isan are vary wildly in quality depending on who's in the kitchen. And this is the same for all of Regular's restaurants. During covid, they didn't even have sticky rice... At a northern Thai restaurant! Focus on one and do it well. Focus on the northern food and do it well. This city has far too many mcThai restaurants and its a shame to see from someone who's cookbook displays much for range and creativity. 
Toronto is ready for real northern Thai. Not slightly better versions of the same stuff that's been served since the 80s.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jen L.,"Pai was highly recommended by literally everyone in Toronto, and it was on our top of the list during our 7 day visit to Toronto. Pai served to its reputation. We dined at around 2pm for late lunch and luckily there was no wait although the restaurant was packed. We were excited about this underground, funky, hip atmosphere. We ordered khao soi with braised beef and tofu pad thai. Thai ice tea was tasty. 
Service was okay. Our server seemed nice but spent little time interacting with us. Food took a long time, about 25 -30 minutes, to come out. Bathroom was spacious and clean. 
Food was delicious nevertheless. Khao soi with braised beef was rich in flavor. Noodles were perfectly cooked, probably housemade. Beef was tender. It was mouthwatering. Pad thai was good but we should have ordered something else. It was good and definitely better than many other thai restaurants, but it was comparable with others. Tofu was too soft, which made overall dish's texture less interesting. 
Overall, we had a great meal and wish to come back soon and try other dishes on the menu.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mikayla S.,"Great food and amazing ambiance. However, despite being seated just after 5pm, many ""only available after 4pm"" dishes were unavailable. Some dishes are also a bit pricey, but seemingly well worth for the quality.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sasha H.,"This place makes some of the best pad Thai hands down! 
The wait is quiet lengthy most times, but if you can wait, the reward is real! While you wait, you're given a button that will flash once your turn is up to get a table. Also while you wait, you can order drinks and snacks which will then get added to your table. 
This place is much larger than it appears from the entry. It has also a couple of traditional seating arrangements where you take off your shoes and sit on a carpet with a low table.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John D.,"My go-to dish here is the pork Pad Gra Prow which is described as ""Holy basil stir fried with your choice of ground Pork, Chicken, Beef or Tofu served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a thai style fried egg. (contains oyster sauce) Served with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime).""
The ground pork has a really great balance of sweet and savoury and tastes more like crumbled sausage than typical ground pork. Breaking the egg yolk over everything, but especially the rice, levels up the dish even further adding creaminess and bulk. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, splash some of the fish sauce over everything, to up the complexity and umami flavors even further. I've also tried the crispy pork version (pictured, $2 up charge) which has small chunks of Filipino-style lechon mixed in with the regular pork.
But wait...there's more...their homemade hot sauce is so good I might just marry it. It's oil-based and has some dried-up strands of something or other (maybe shrimp?) along with spices that ups your already delicious food that much further. 
Usually get take out but the decor is fun and chill and makes you feel like you're in some neighbourhood bar in the Southeast Pacific. Pro-tip: if you're getting take out, head straight to the back near the kitchen and order from the little booth.
Closest subway station is St. Andrew which is less than 5 minutes walk away.
The *only* reason this place gets 4 stars vs. 5 is the price. At almost $17, even at lunch, the Pad Gra Prow is something I can  afford once and awhile rather than something I'd get more regularly if I worked or lived downtown.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael W.,"Found this place through google reviews.  I came here on a Thursday night casually after work to eat dinner.  This place was packed.  This is a very cool hipster Thai place. The focused is northern Thai food with a sweeter taste. They do have a full bar as well. 
Food: ordered the Thai wings, starter the Tom yum soup, and the pad gra pro with crispy pork.  IThe Thai wings were amazing.  Very Crispy and tasty. However, the portion size was just sad. You get 3 pieces for $6... the starter Tom yum was okay.  It was cold the first time and I had to send it back to get a hot one.  It was a very tasty soup.  The pad gra gro with beef rice was amazing.  The sunny side egg was cooked to perfection. I squeezed a bit of lime to bring the flavor out more. I ended the dinner with a Thai ice cream.  It was very well balanced and not as sweet as the Thai iced tea. It was creamy as well.  (4/5) 
Service: I sat at the bar and the bartender was phenomenal.  He gave me recommendations and quickly served me water.   He was pretty attentive. (4/5)
Atmosphere: the place is a bit deceiving in size. It looks small but it seems like it can easily sit about 60-70 people.  It is very hipster and loud. It is pretty chill place to hang out and have a great dinner with friends.  (4.5/5)
Overall I am going to come back here with friends to enjoy drinks and dinner.  They got some pretty creative drinks.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Areej Q.,"It was our first visit. The place was crazy busy, lineups straight out the door! Reservations cannot be made over the phone, you have to go in person and wait to be seated and/or put your name down on a waitlist to be contacted. We waited an hour to be called over. In the meantime, went across the street and sat in a coffee shop.
The food was good although I was quite disappointed with only 5 pieces of shrimp in a dish that cost $18. Hmm. Really? Understandable that seafood is pricey but don't be stingy and charge extra and not provide sufficient amounts! Something to consider.. I was deprived of adequate protein.
We also ordered an appy that never came. Our main dishes arrived with no appetizer in sight. Flagged down a server to cancel that order.
If I ever go back, I'll try the khao soi.
Giving the resturant 4* because service was decent given the fact that staff were running around trying to attend to diners and the place was clean.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edward W.,"We came on a Saturday for lunch around 12pm and surprisingly had no wait. 
I ordered a Khao Soi with beef and it was marvelous. I visited Chiang Mai back in 2013 and this dish really brings me back to the cuisines there. It's very authentic and one of my favorite dishes I had in Thailand. One thing that I love about this dish is that it has a mix of crunchy and egg noodles. Really changes the texture you feel compared to a typical noodle dish. The beef is quite tender and the golden curry is extremely flavorful. 
The seating here was a bit cramped cause the table was right up against a wooden support. Try to avoid that seat if you can!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bo W.,"Not exactly sure what the hype was about.  The restaurant really feels more like a bar that serves food than a serious Thai place.  On a Monday night the place was full of hipsters and millennials which in and of itself isn't bad as long the food is up to snuff.  
Looking at the menu I was really looking forward to the Tom yum soup but it was way too over powering on the lemongrass and spice for my liking so by comparison the thai wings seemed a bit bland.  My entree rice dish, the name escapes me now, was average and not very memorable.  I think the reason why it has such a high number of reviews is because it caters to said millennial crowd who perhaps hasn't had too many life experiences to know that this is grossly over priced.
Find a Thai place in an ethnic neighborhood instead.  You'll pay half as much for something twice as good.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Courtney C.,"I finally understand what all the buzz is about! I went here to grab some food for Mother's Day, and I'm so happy I did.
Lots of people waiting for their orders but the process is super thorough so it's not an unpleasant experience. You order online on their website and receive a time to pick-up. When you arrive they have an electronic screen with order names on it,  they also call out your name if it's ready. Super painless and efficient.
I ordered the tum yum soup appetizer, chicken pad thai, Massaman beef curry, and chicken panang curry. Everything was delicious. Other reviews were right to highlight how delicious the pad Thai and curries are. The spice level I chose was ""medium"" and it was just perfect. Could have done it a bit spicier but didn't want to chance it this time around.
The portions are not large but good for two people. It's definitely packed with flavour so you're paying for quality - not quantity. Definitely worth the higher end of prices for the tastiness of the food.
Highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pratyusha T.,"Great ambience, good food and competitive pricing. Worth a try if you are in downtown.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenuine T.,"We only tried out Pai once, but our first experience was great! Very friendly customer service and the restaurant interior reflects a rustic-patio vibe - very cool. We tried the ""Khao Soi"" dish, which is probably the most popular - so good!! Highly recommend, with the golden curry and braised beef [or choice of chicken breast/drumstick]. The ""Thai Iced Tea"" ($5.75) is also a classic on the menu, a signature Thai drink and it was delicious! Highly recommend Pai for great Thai food!
Tip: head to Pai early, we've seen the lines get pretty long after work hours (past 5PM)!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aynaz K.,PAI is my favourite Thai place in toronto. They are the best panacean curry!! and their restaurant interior also looks very cute.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,William Y.,Definately one of the best thai places in the city. This is place is a must if your looking for a thai restaurant in Toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eric P.,"What can I say? It's only our favorite Thai restaurant of ALL TIME. Okay we haven't been to Thailand, but compared to other Thai restaurants we've tried in Asia, NA, Europe, Chef Nuit's Pad Thai is a distinct winner. Other dishes such as Pad Gra Prow, Curries, Spring Roll, and Tom Yum do not disappoint; I can't say I've regretted ordering anything at Pai. (share the same roots/chef as the original Sukho Thai I think...) Their Yonge and Eg location is awesome, too. The decor and ambiance is actually a step up!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pallabi G.,"This place made me feel like I was back on the streets of Chiang Mai again. The Ambiance is just spot-on! It's such a fun, lively atmosphere and the space is huge! You think you're seeing all of it but it goes back quite a ways.   
The food is also very authentic. We had the fried squash blossoms, which was an enormous amount of very crispy delicious fritters, and a picture of lychee sangria to start. The sangria was very good and I particularly enjoyed the exotic fruit flavors. For our entrees, we had the green curry served in a coconut and  and the Pad Gra Pow. We got the Pad Grab Pow Thai spicy and it definitely seriously spicy. My husband loved it but I struggled. It was delicious though. 
I thought the prices were a little bit high for food was delicious, but simple. But we are in the middle of a city so a little inflation is to be expected.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David R.,Excellent Thai cuisine. We ordered to go and the food was prepared exactly as ordered & in a timely manner. We will be going again. Solid A,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,N L.,"I enjoy the atmosphere and the food here. There's always a line up but if you make a reservation you don't have to wait long. Small groups can share a table and you can be seated faster if you forget to reserve a table. 
I usually get vegan khao soi for myself. The flavour is good but not always consistent. Sometimes the sauce is too thick and other times it's too runny. Overall things are good and I'll visit again.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shawn F.,"In terms of Thai food, Pai meets the mark above any other place I've heard of or been to for Thai cuisine.
Atmosphere: 8/10
Entering through glass doors, you walk down stairs to what looks like a modern speakeasy. You are greeted by the hostess and luckily we were promptly brought to a table (a wait is very common even on most weeknights).In the case you do wait, on the left side once you enter there's a bar area with some sitting space to sip a curated cocktail. In the evening the resto is dim lit and all through out the large space it is filled with musical memorabilia on the walls to entice the wandering eye. Though the space is pretty large I don't remember it being very noisy, which is conducive for easy conversation.  
Service: 7.5/10
After being seated a server comes over and asks us if it's our first time dining, for me it was, and I was excited to begin our adventure. The server was helpful in showing us some enticing options on the menu though the friends who brought me pretty much knew what the top choices to order was. 
Food: 8.5/10
For Thai food, Pai is a cut above most others that try to compare. Here is what we had...
1. Northern Thai Sausage 7.5/10
This was different than most sausage i've tried before, with a great savoury taste, this dish is a nice app to share. The sticky rice fits well with it. Probably my least favourite, though it was still good. 
2. Grabong (squash fritters) 8/10
For an alt take on fries, you can't go wrong with these. Paired with the Tamarind dip these are a delicious starter to open your palate to everything else Pai has to offer. 
3. Khao Soi (8/10) 
This dish gives you great flavour with contrasting textures of the braised beef (you can also choose chicken breast or drumstick), curry broth and fresh egg noodle that had the end part deep fried and sticks out of the bowl. Not incredibly spicy but definitely gives a power pack of flavour for your taste buds to delight in. 
4. Green Curry chicken served in coconut (8.5/10)
This is certainly the dish people pilgrimage to Pai for. The idea that serving a curry with meat in a coconut bowl is genius, as it's able to soak up all the coconut flavour and then allow you after to scoop out the juicy flesh of the coconut. This was my favourite dish to try that evening and I highly suggest you order it when you go. 
5. Pad Thai (8/10) 
This thai pasta dish surpasses most pad thai's out there. Noodles were fresh and the sauce was the boss of this dish! Enjoyed every single bite. If you want a familiar taste of thai food, go for this dish. 
Verdict is in and Pai is guilty...... 
of being one of the best Thai resto's in the city! Expect a good time and great food to boot! I can't wait to go back again, and again, and again....and again.....",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Heidi A.,"Delicious food, variety of cocktails/drinks to try and great casual ambiance. Staff are very friendly and this place is quite popular so expect to wait during rush hour times (they have buzzers) or prepare for time in advance. Personally, my wait wasn't so bad (~10 minutes at 5:30PM- was I lucky? Who knows.) 
Side note- they have a bit of We the North theme going on as well. There's a bar and dining area. Seating is larger than what you originally see (there's more seating are past a small hallway).
For food we tried: the Grabong (a great app to share with a group of friends/personal staple app; sauce is sweet and complements it), Moo Ping (3 skewers of nicely marinated, chewy/fatty pork) and the Kung Tawt (fried shrimps with a sauce to dip).
For mains we tried the Khai Soi (AMAZING. Highly recommend. Personally, I prefer the chicken over beef, but the beef is nice big chunks if that's your preferred meat); and the Pad Thai (delicious, as you expect with pad thai).
For cocktails we've tried the Thai Mojito, Summer Dog and Plum Mule. I definitely need to come back and try their lychee sangria. Thai iced tea is always a good option if you don't want alcohol. 
For dessert I tried the mango sticky rice. Simple and delicious but pricier than expected (10$!!). Make sure you ask what the prices are because the dessert options aren't on the menu.
I foresee multiple trips to this location and I'll just work my way around everything on the menu or simply to come back for some Khao Soi.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike Z.,It's crazy I was in Malibu (Cali) at a high end sushi place and the server said the best Thai place in Toronto issss....Pai...and we all agreed hahaha.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Selena C.,"Even though the wait times for dinner are usually quite long, this place never disappoints. It's got great authentic thai food and flavor, plus it's a great place to meet up with friends after work in the entertainment district. Expect to wait for about 30 minutes when you get here during prime dinner time, but I think the wait is worth it. It's quite loud and not very accessible. Over the years, they've downsized some portions (especially the coconut curry, which used to be a large coconut). It's a very trendy and fun place for a date too.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Akki R.,"I had Green curry and Pad Thai. 
Both were superb with presentation and taste. 
Thai ice tea was average.
Green Curry is served in coconut shell.
I removed star for wait time and service.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Akhilesh R.,"We went on a Thursday night around 9:15 pm and the place was packed. They have a happening bar area. The decor inside is trendy. 
Nice cocktail and beer list. Cool mule was refreshing. Lots of vegetarian options. The taste is where all the stars are worth. Service for a busy time was efficient. Ask for the hot sauce it's so spicy. 
Pad gra prow with tofu and a fried egg was tasty as hell. The pad cha hett was equally tasty with the veggies and mushrooms. The gaeng panang was flavorful and a safe dish one can't go wrong with. 
A must visit if you want Thai cuisine right in downtown Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steph L.,"Why have I not written a review for Pai yet! Let me hop on that bandwagon and get in on that hype. 
Discretion: My review is entirely based on the food alone since I have never dined in. I cannot comment on the service. 
Needless to say, Pai is amazing. I have had it multiple times (doesn't help that we live literally right above it), and they have been consistent every single time. There's no one experience that fell short for us. I have never actually dined in yet, since the line is ridiculous and I live right by it, but ritual/take out never failed once. It is probably one of the best thai restaurants, if not, the best one so far in Toronto.  
Food wise, I think most of us would agree that this place serves delicious authentic thai food. Having been to both northern and southern Thailand, the food at Pai is as authentic as can be (but obviously at a much more inflated price, which is understood). 
THAI CHICKEN WINGS - juicy plump wings and very well seasoned. A great starter! 
GAI SATAY - can never go wrong with satay. 
LAAP SALAD - the minced pork is marinated very well. It is a very nicely paired dish with the sticky rice. And there's something in her sticky rice that is quite addictive. 
PANANG BEEF CURRY - no complaints, absolutely delicious. 
PAD GRA PROW - One of my go-tos. It hits the spot every time. The rice is delicious, the minced beef is so well-seasoned. The combo is a killer, and I love it! 
KHAO SOI - Hat off to the authenticity of this dish. It tastes exactly the same as the ones I've had in Changmai. The only one complaint I have is that there isn't enough egg noodles!  The coconut milk in the curry makes the soup so incredibly addictive. 
CHEF NUIT PAD THAI - also one of their staples. There is a very good balance with the tanginess and sweetness in the sauce. The noodles are stir-fried just enough that it is not too dry nor too wet. It is really so so good! 
Pai nails every dish every time even on our take out orders. This is a restaurant that I recommend to all my friends who are visiting from out of town. Keep up the great work Pai!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa X.,"I've come to Pai a handful of times seeking something flavourful, and my tastebuds have never left unsatisfied!
The wait time to get a table can be long, especially during lunch and dinner time. We got here at 5:30 pm on a Saturday and waited about 30 minutes. By the time we left at 7:30 pm, the wait time was over an hour long! So definitely get here early. While waiting, you get a buzzer, so you're free to get a drink at the bar or get some much-needed fresh air without losing your spot in line.
Although the wait time can be long, the food definitely makes up for it! We started with the Moo Ping, which is grilled pork skewers--although small, they were absolutely delicious! I had the Gang Kiaw Wan, which is green curry served in a coconut. Not going to lie, I did get this dish pretty much because it was served in a coconut, but the food definitely tasted as good as it looked! Although it was medium spice, it wasn't too much to handle. The curry's sweetness and the rice definitely helped with the spiciness!
Other than the long lines, my only complaint would be the service, especially during busy times. Our server basically disappeared after almost taking our orders. Thankfully the bartender was attentive, and stepped in to take our orders and bring us the bills when we were getting restless!
All in all, I would definitely recommend a visit to Pai. They serve some of the best Thai food you can get in the city, however be sure to leave enough time for the wait!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Takeshi K.,"We made a reservation about a month ago for 8pm on January 3rd, and my date and I got the following:
-Gai Satay
-Starter Tom Yum Shrimp
-Gaeng Masaman
-Pad Thai
-Thai Ice Tea
-Thai Ice Tea Ice Cream
And what can I say. . . They were all so good! We had high expectations of the place, but we were not disappointed.
Gai Satay:
The chicken skewers were tender, and the cucumber dressing complimented the skewers really well. I'm a HUGE fan of peanut sauce, and I have to admit that their peanut sauce was really good with a nice kick to it. But we enjoyed the cucumber dressing more. I also found that the peanut sauce went well with the skewers more, once the dish got cold.
Tom Yum:
Top 3 Tom Yum I've had in my life. The other comparable one was in Japan. It was perfect.
Gaeng Masaman (Chicken):
My date ordered it so I only had a few bites. Well. . . it may have been more than a few bites because they were gooooooooood!
Pad Thai (Beef):
I'm not sure if I should even bother writing a review for this because everyone knows how amazing their Pad Thai is. This might have been the best Pad Thai that I've ever had.
Thai Ice Tea:
They were really good but GET IT WITH LESS ICE. When I asked for a tiny bit of ice, they gave me the perfect amount.
I love Thai Ice Tea. Many of you would probably disagree, but it almost tastes like Kinder Egg Milk Tea.
Thai Ice Tea Ice Cream:
They were exactly as I imagined it to be but creamier. And the tapioca complimented the ice cream well. The peanuts and cereal added a nice crunch to the dish as well. It was a good amount to share.
Service: The waiters and waitresses were really nice, but the service itself was unremarkable. They were busy, but they didn't come to fill our cups once. However, when we needed something, they were prompt and attentive.
Needless to say, I would definitely come back here again to try the Green Curry and Spring Rolls. But I don't know. . . I feel like I would want to order the same thing over again. :P",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel F.,"If you can get a table here, definitely recommended. Quality Thai dishes made fresh. Very busy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kavi R.,"Still my favourite Thai place in Toronto! 
Ordered the following:
1. Sai Ua Platter: 10/10 (Northern Thai): Homemade Pork belly sausages served with sticky rice. The sausages were so flavourful & the tomato relish was bomb! 
2. Green Curry w/ Shrimp: 10/10. Good amount of spice and curry. Comes with a bowl of rice. Can't go wrong with this dish! 
3. Beef Khao Soi: 10/10. The curry was SO DELICIOUS. Beef was nice and tender. Good amount of noodles to go with the curry. Would definitely order this again
4. Mango rice (dessert): 10/10. Half a mango sliced on top of glazed coconut milk sticky rice. DELICIOUS!!!!! Great way to end.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arti B.,I tried the pad thai and it was pathetic. Never going back again. It had a lot of cabbage and wasn't made fresh. Totally disappointed as I went there first time with high hopes after reading the review.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tania M.,"Honestly there are many better Thai restaurants in Toronto. I feel like Pie's food is usually really greasy/oily, and the flavour isn't as good as the competitors. I love the Thai ice tea tho.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jo-Anne L.,"First of all, an emphasis that the food by itself is 5-star quality. I have no idea what magical ingredients or spices they put in their soup/curry/noodles, but it's absolutely delicious. I also really enjoyed the vibe of the place - the decorations were on the hippie side, down to the tables and chairs and the washrooms. Reservations can be made easily online, a huge plus in my opinion (especially downtown...).
The stars I took off were for service alone. We went there on a Monday afternoon at 2pm, and the restaurant was half empty. So I really cannot understand why our waitress seemed to be in such a hurry to get us out of the place. 5 minutes after I received the menu, she came up to ask for orders - of course, we said that we needed more time. She gave us another 5 minutes, then came again! We asked for more time.
On the other hand, it took us multiple tries to get our water glasses refilled. Please understand that this was pretty annoying since the food could get quite spicy and water is sort of a necessity. Then, as soon as my bowl was empty, the waitress (the same waitress who disappeared throughout the rest of our meal), materialized and asked if we would like our bills. Needless to say, we were not greeted on our way out.
Damnit, Pai! I really wanted to give you a high rating after salivating over all the pictures here.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Smriti K.,"A 4 day trip and I went there twice! That, is quite unusual for me to do so. The place reminded me of wandering through the busy streets of Bangkok and ending up in an underground authentic Thai spot! 
The place has a great contemporary vibe with an in-depth authentic flavors of Thai food. Their spring rolls and Pad Thai are to die for! The spices, quantity, quality is pretty spot on! 
A perfect place to go , especially in the bitter cold winter times of Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lorenzo L.,"Rating: 3 1/2*
I finally made it here after having this restaurant bookmarked for the longest time. I was always intrigued with the outstanding reviews and wanting to learn more about Thai cuisine. 
We came here right after they opened at 11:30am on a Saturday. We were a party of three. 
I'll format this review based on the title of one of my favourite Western movies. 
The Good: 
I like the decor of the restaurant and the actual location. The way the restaurant is set up with the tables, the decorations and being in a basement, helps convey the feeling that you are somewhere in Southeast Asia. The restaurant is divided into a ""Kitchen"" and ""Market"" sections. The Kitchen section is the restaurant part. 
The washrooms are nice and clean although the Ladies one was out of service and you needed to go to the Market section. 
Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Shrimps at a falang spicy level was a great dish. The noodles were cooked right, there were a proper amount of shrimps and the spice level was appropriate. I like you can adjust the spice level in this dish. The Falang is the second spiciest with the Thai being the first. Also, you can order the Pad Thai with beef, pork, chicken or tofu if you want. 
The Bad:
The service was a bit lacking. The initial table that the hostess gave us was not convenient for us and we requested a different table as the restaurant was fairly empty at the time. She was not impressed and wouldn't let us sit at the back. We ended up sitting at the table right as you come down the stairs. Our initial waiter was good but after he took our order, he disappeared and we got different people serving us until we left. 
The Gaeng Klaw Wan with chicken dish was a bit disappointing. They state that the dish comes in a mild/medium spice level. It was a bit bland for us. The presentation was cute as the curry was served in a coconut. 
The prices are on the high side. Some of the dishes are not worth what they are charging for. 
The Ugly: 
Khao Pad Thamada with chicken dish which is basically a stir fried rice was not very good. The dish was so bland with no hint of seasoning or spice. I had better fried rice in a Chinese restaurant at a much lower price. 
Overall, it was an above average experience but I highly doubt that we be coming back to this place again.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivian B.,"Finally got to try out Pai! Super late review tho, oops. I came by party of 4 on a Sat afternoon to grab lunch. A lot of people told me it gets really busy and it did looked a little packed but wasn't too bad. Lively and upbeat place! Didn't have to wait long maybe like 6 mins. Got seated on one of the high tables on the side near the low cushioned seats. Spacious enough for 4 people. 
I ordered the khao soi and this was good but it was a little on the cool side imo. My friend also said the same for his bowl as well. Was creamy and brothy. They were generous with my chicken protein. 
The pad thai was prob one of the best I've tried. 
I really enjoyed the thai iced tea. I've been craving for one ever since!
As an app to share, we ordered the garbong? Don't know if I spent this right but it's basically squash fritters. Tastes like sweet potato fries to me but this was really good and I would order this again. The sauce that came with it was a perfect match.
I would come back again!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elvis A.,"Another solid Thai restaurant. However since they all seem to have almost the same menu everywhere in these new spots (and similar taste) not sure how to rate these anymore. This is a much better setup than the other offerings. I mainly stick to either the Pad Thai or Khao Soi with beef. They are good as always and I also appreciate that they have Delerium Tremens beer which goes well with the food. The wine prices are decent as well.
3.5 stars as its a given that most of these Thai food places taste the same.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,A A.,"There was a loooong line out the door. But do not let that deter you! Line goes pretty fast surprisingly. It's all worth the wait!! Had the crispy garlic shrimp appetizer. It was super delicious!! Scarfed that down and decided to do the veggie pad Thai. I know sounds boring but it was possibly the Best Pad Thai ever! Noodles were perfectly done with great flavor as well.
While enjoying the pad Thai I decided to have another dish since I won't be able to come back again on this trip. I should have taken the servers recommendation for the ga prow. Instead I opted for the oxtail. The meat was super tender. However it was a tad sweet for me. Should have listened to the previous review. The set up of the restaurant is pretty neat!
All in all it was a great meal and definitely recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha H.,"DELICIOUS THAI FOOD. We were so excited we literally planned the night before to make sure got everything we wanted including the delicious pad thai (two orders) and khao soi and the delectable Thai chicken wings (two orders). There are three wings per order fyi. The entree portions are generous! The khao soi was very rich, so I wouldn't like to have *just that* so the balance was wonderful to achieve with sharing the dish and sharing pad thai as well. The noodles are perfect thickness, and the curry so yummy. You'd think pad thai would be a basic order, but the noodles here are excellent, and the seasoning was on point without being too sweet. Call ahead to make a reservation because this place is well-known!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sandra B.,I got the chicken peanut pad Thai it was tasty but feel like it should have vegetables. It's really important for a dish to have variety besides noodles and meat. It add some colour and texture to the dish.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katie C.,"The experience was the complete opposite of my expectations. Was imagining a quiet, fancy-ish authetic Thai establishment with mindblowing food.
There's a patio but the inside of the restaurant is like a basement, loud music and dark, quite westernized. The whole vibe is very casual, all the servers are wearing their summer clothes aka cargo shorts and runners.
Menu prices are very steep, around $16-18 for a main. We got the Chiang Mai Beef Noodles and Chicken Drumstick Khao Soi, both less than averag even when price is not factored in. Both proteins were dry...never had dry dark chicken meat before. Beef noodles definitely had a larger profile of flavours and was mildly spicy. Khao Soi was the reason we came and it was a disappointment. Didn't like the noodles and the bowl seemed quite boring, just noodles after noodles in curry.
Service: There were a lot of staff but yet hard to get anyone's attention. Had to wait a couple mins before one server came over so that we could tell him our order was wrong.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rovelyne P.,"If youre looking for an intimate & quiet place, this is not the restaurant for you. It's always pretty packed in here. They give you a BUZZER and you wait for your table. 
However, if the noise doesnt bother you - you'll get authentic thai food here.
Ordered the following:
chicken pad thai ($16.50)
Khao Pla Tawt - a.k.a Crispy fish fillet with rice ($16) lol 
Thai iced tea ($5.75)
The flavours did not disappoint!!!
The only downside with this is the LACK OF STAFF. Considering the amount of people that come & go in this place, I expect more staffs. It usually takes time to catch the attention of the staffs to ask or request for things...
But other than that, I'll still go back for the food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Song P.,How the hell does this place get 4.5? Ok i get that the decor is nice and service is good. But the food though. I got green curry and it's not even spicy??? Like how is this Thai food. More like white people's Thai food,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Damian W.,"Food: 4.0/5.0
Service: 1.0/5.0
Value: 3.0/5.0
Decor: 3.0/5.0
Overall: 3.5/5.0
Pretty long wait on a weekday late evening.  The food was actually pretty good when it was served right, so I'm really aggressively ignoring the all-over-the-place service in giving these guys the 4th star.  It was a busy night, but still, the water was super slow to arrive (the young lady covering our table spent maybe a third of her time chatting with a colleague), and one of the entrees arrived cold (assuming it sat somewhere for a while).  As I write this review, I regret not leaving a smaller tip.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melody Z.,"I think they have the best Thai food in Toronto.
They own a bunch of the other restaurants in the city.
Papaya salad is super refreshing. The fried pork rinds and prawn chips that come with it are are super yummy.
Khao Soi with braised beef has depths of flavour. The braised beef is very tender.
Pad Gra Prow with pork belly is bomb as usual. Fragrant basil with crispy pork belly. Fried egg on top.
I would recommend going right when they open for lunch at 11:30am. It fills up fast.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica C.,"Came here for an early dinner on a weekday; be warned, it gets really packed because the food is DANGEROUSLY GOOD! The best authentic Thai food that I've had in Toronto!
I would actually give Pai a 4.5/5, only due to the slow service. The restaurant itself seats lots of people and does not have too many servers, so the service is actually quite slow (but still everyone was extremely nice and friendly). We got seated right away and did not need to wait the line since we were okay with a communal table, which was actually enjoyable since they separate your party and the party next to you by leaving an empty seat. 
We ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Chicken! It was so packed with flavour and the portion size was really good. It was a nice blend of both sweet and savoury, with the perfect amount of peanuts and coriander. 
I'm excited to come back soon to try more food from their menu!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adie N.,"If you want to dine in and experience an explosion of flavour - this is the place to be! Try their famous Chef Nuit's Pad Thai and Pad Gra Prow which is my personal favorite  for starters, get the Shrimp Chips! The ambience on both branches also are super hip, you can go to this place for pretty much whatever dining purpose - casual dinner to date place. Unpretentious and worth every penny!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley T.,"I came here on a Monday as a group of four for lunch. By the time I arrived, my friends had already gotten a table so I didn't have to wait.
Pai is huge! If you get seated in one of the rooms in the back, it's like walking through a maze to get to your table. This time we were seated in the room to the left of the entrance and bar and there was a lot of natural lighting that came in. Even though it was a weekday and during lunch time, it was still quite busy and there was a good amount of chatter in the air. I love that the restaurant is so big, has a casual vibe to it, and is decorated nicely with cool paintings on the walls. They also had coat racks and hooks for jackets which is great for the winter time. 
The service was quite good as our waitress talked about the menu and the daily specials. I ordered the khao soi and it was delicious. It was also plated very nicely with crispy noodles coming out of the bowl, and had a bright orange colour to it. I really enjoyed the egg noodles as they were cooked just right and were chewy but soft from the broth. The dishes are a little on the pricier side but they make it up for flavour and lots of ingredients in the dishes. 
Overall, I enjoy coming to Pai as it's in a great location in the downtown core, has a great casual vibe to come and hang in with friends, and a simple menu with great tasting dishes. Will be back when I have a Thai craving!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Guancheng C.,"Flavoured pad thai dish
clean light taste and crsipy texture of the vegetable fibers
Good for lunch",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sweedel D.,"My favorite restaurant in Toronto. My go to order is the raw papaya salad, pad Thai (obviously), the fried fish with rice and curry and of course I'd recommend anything from their dessert selection. I've been here so many times and the experience every one of those times has been nothing short of exceptional. I highly recommend for all Thai food lovers!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rosey L.,"I've been here 4 times, and have tried the squash fritters (amazing!), classic pad Thai (also great), the green curry (it comes in a coconut and you can eat the coconut meat!), and the Miang Kung (betel leaf wraps, good low carb/paleo option). 
I love coming here with friends but be warned of the long waits (45-60min) during peak times around 7pm.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lester C.,"Pai hits the mark for me for authentic Thai food in the heart of Toronto. Located near the entertainment district, Pai is inside a basement and well renovated. A unique design and tight seating, it does give you a bit of a unique Asian feel.
We arrived on a Saturday evening with a long line ahead of us. We told the host we'd be happy to sit at the bar or sit with others (basically we'd sit anywhere). Originally indicated we had a 1.5 hour wait ahead of us, he managed to fit us in a smaller spot within 10 minutes! 
Food itself is meets my expectations. We particularly enjoyed the Khao Soi with the soup being flavourful and the noodles fresh. The Thai iced tea is also a must try if you're at Pai. Service will probably seem a bit rushed but that's because they always have a lineup!
Overall, I'd visit again and put Pai at the top of my list for Thai restaurants in the city.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J D.,Best Thai restaurant in Toronto. The Khao Soi is so rich and divine. There are different styles of Pad Thai. And the vibe is like a backpack or hangout in Thailand.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sebastian S.,"Even though there was a wait of about 30 minutes it was totally worth it! The appetizers as well as the entrees were absolutely delicious. The overall atmosphere was very chill and hip. Since the restaurant was quiet crowded the servers were buisy but very kind nonetheless. 
I recommend the Grabong for starters and the Panang as an entree! Delicious!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine M.,"We'd heard great things about this place a long time ago so tried to make a reservation... We were shocked that we could only reserve for 6 weeks or something in the future. ""Must really be popular!"" When, 6 weeks hence, we finally went, we realized (duh) that this place clearly only allows reservations for 1-2 tables, and everything else is drop in, wait and enjoy the vibe.
We smartened up our second time, showed up and waited in the waiting corral/bar with an interesting IPA we'd never tried before and our little flash 'em device that would alert us when our table was ready. Our flash 'em never flashed and when I asked the hostess what was going on, it was clear we'd been missed on their list, or whatever. No matter, she got a table for us and we sat down. The crowd is young and having fun here, the key is to just go with the flow. 
The food is excellent! Make sure you get the tom yum! The green curry in the coconut is also amazing, don't forget to scoop the innards.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fiona A.,"My boyfriend and I stopped by here before the Raptors game last Sunday at around 4:30PM. We didn't have a reservation but managed to get a table right away. The restaurant was still around 80% full during this time, which I was expecting considering what a popular place it is to eat in Downtown! 
We ended up ordering the Thai iced tea ($5.75), Khao Soi with beef brisket ($15), the Chicken Satay Skewers ($14).
Thai iced tea: Price was a bit steep for what it was but I totally changed my mind after taking my first sip. This was SO delicious and refreshing!! I could not stop drinking it and I almost wanted to get another order of this. The drink was the perfect ratio of black tea, condensed milk and ice. Very refreshing and I highly recommend giving this a try if you enjoy bubbletea/iced tea in general. 
Khao Soi: This was quite yummy -- beef was perfectly cooked and the crunchy noodles added a nice texture with the soup noodles. The curry-based broth was delicious and I wanted to slurp this all up.
Chicken Satay Skewers: These were tasty as well and great for sharing but for the size and portion it felt a bit steep for $14. I probably wouldn't get this the next time I come here.
Service was very attentive and friendly. The restaurant is quite loud as many large groups come here to socialize and hang out. I suggest making a reservation or coming during off-peak times so that you don't have to wait forever for a table.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mingyang C.,"As an asian, i tried many Thai restaurant. This one is definitely a good one to start if you are new to this cuisine. The dish seems a bit little for me though compare to its price. But the flavor is good.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Allan H.,Dishes are delicious and full of flavour; their spices blend very nicely with their coconut concoctions to create a very savoury after-taste that comparatively as pleasant as the smell,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Helen B.,"The price is so good for the food quality, definitely will come back! Beware that the place is usually full, so if you are looking for a quiet place, this is not what you are looking for",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha Y.,"I've been wanting to try this place in years. I guess I had too high of expectations given their price and popularity. 
Grabong - This was probably the best thing on the menu. Very hot, crispy, and perfect for sharing! However I would say it's a little heavy for an appetizer - best for groups of 4+.
For mains we ordered Khao Soi, Pad Gra Prow, Gang Kiaw Wan, and Tom Yum Kung. The food was okay, but nothing really special in my opinion. Everything except for the Tom Yum Kung was a little too sweet for my liking. 
I honestly was expecting a lot more.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sel Z.,"One of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto! There are always lineups, especially during dinner hours and on weekends. Food is amazing - pad thai, papaya salad, pad gra prow, curries in coconut shell. It's one of the few places that serves fresh coconut water that doesn't come from a can.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amelia C.,"Finally had the chance to try out PAI in downtown Toronto! Have heard really good review of this place from tons of friends so I decided to come and try out!
I made reservation couple months ago because they're always fully booked and if you come walk in, good luck in waiting for hours to get a table cuz this place is PACKED!! However, they're so considerate that having a corner for you to sit and grab a drink while waiting which is pretty nice during this winter time 
Their service was good in general, from the moment I came until leaving the restaurant, all the staffs are nice and polite! 
We ordered Som Tum Tad (papaya salad) with salted crab for starter, it was quite a bit too spicy for me considering I don't have a high tolerance in spicy food  although we only ordered medium spicy...but honestly the salad is really good other than the fact that is spicy and the crab itself is too little in portion so I'd recommend getting shrimp than crab in this dish 
Next, I ordered Khao Soi with braised beef cuz I've seen good reviews of this dish on yelp so I had a pretty high expectation for it. I'm not sure if I had my expectation too high, the soup base is too sweet for me personally...that's something I was disappointed about  but the noodles was chewy and not mushy, and I think they fried some noodles and have it on the side which gives me an interesting texture when eating everything in a bit with a little bit of crunchiness 
My overall experience here is nice and I would wanna come again and try their curry and pad Thai
Oh! And just a heads up for their portion is slightly smaller than other restaurant that you normally go to so one starter and two mains would be good for two person if you didn't eat anything before dinner",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vincent H.,"Ambiance is great, fun and friendly staff, amazing food. Great cocktails and perfect atmosphere.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grete S.,"Authentic and traditional Thai cuisine!!! We ordered the pad Thai and it was delicious, the butternut squash appetizer was very good and it didn't taste greasy even if it was fried. The only problem we had was the veggie stir fry I ordered was cold and they brought another one and it was still cold. However, everything I tried was incredible. It was like taking a trip to eat in Thailand for the night.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike W.,"It was alright. Went in here for lunch service and ordered the Khao soi.  I knew all the hype surrounding this restaurant. 
To be honest I don't understand why they are awarded with such accolades I stayed in Thailand for a month so I will use that for comparison. 
I find the Khao soi too rich and coconutty. It over takes the subtle nuances of a balanced dish. It just taste like coconut cream soup. I wouldn't make this the quintessential place for Thai food. Support other local businesses.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tina D.,"Came here twice and had the vegetarian spring rolls, grabong, chicken pad thai and Thai iced tea ice cream  Everything we tried was absolutely delicious! I'm not a big fan of spring rolls but these were amazing! The grabong - butternut squash fritters were so yummy and not at all greasy. The pad thai was perfect - not too sweet at all and the Thai iced tea ice cream was the perfect dessert. This is one of my favourite Thai restaurants. We also sat at the traditional Thai seating area where you take off your shoes and sit on a cushion which I wouldn't recommend because it was very uncomfortable. 
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and can't wait to come back for the 3rd time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zinat T.,"What an amazing place. The vibe is super cool, with Whitney Houston and Biggie Smalls playing while you eat. The staff was so nice! We started with the Kung Tawt and Spring rolls. My kids and my husband gobbled it all up. We moved on to the pad Thai with beef and shrimp, then the Pad Graw Prow and I can't remember the other name! But it was a delicious curry. 
We have a lot of Thai restaurants where we live in Southern California and I must say, this place was better than most places back home. 
The waitress was so accommodating, kind and was always checking on us. I can't recommend this place enough.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Signe L.,"In 2019, this was voted the best pad thai in Toronto. It was definitely better than the rest I've ordered from DoorDash-- not too greasy, balanced flavours, choice of spice level. The finely shredded cabbage was appreciated as a fresh ingredient to add some crunch, but look at the pic! It definitely needs more colour and the nutrients they would bring. Red pepper, more lime, mung bean sprouts and definitely cilantro! It needs to be kicked up a notch on all levels. The veg that was there was old and overcooked. Probably won't order this again.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chel L.,Great atmosphere! The food is definitely tasty and is true to Thai flavours. The portions are great as well.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Calvin F.,"This was a highly anticipated Thai place that had been recommended by a lot of our friends. We've been to Toronto several times, but had never dined here after several failed attempts. We decided to dine here at off-hours since the wait was always so long.
This place is definitely worth a visit. Being from the SF Bay Area, where there are lots of Asian food snobs, we didn't think Thai food could get much better. Boy were we wrong. This Northern Thai style restaurant exceeded our expectations. The ambience made for a lively yet authentic feel, and it felt like the perfect escape from the rain into a whole new world.
The laap salad was by far our favorite - a mix of sweet and savory, with a blend of flavors that made for the perfect mix. The only other southeast Asian salad that I think compares is the tea leaf salad from Burma Superstar.  We also tried the squash fritters, which I think we could've done without, the pad gra prow, which was delicious (and that's my go-to Thai dish) and the khao soi, which was just perfect given the weather - flavorful, but not overwhelmingly so, and not too spicy. Finally, before yelping other dessert places and deciding there wouldn't be anything quite as good as mango sticky rice, we went with just that. And that did not disappoint! We wanted to get 3 more so that each person could have 1, but decided that wouldn't be so healthy...! Definitely coming back the next time we're in the 6!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cindy F.,"I ordered the following from ubereats since I know the lines are long:
-starter Tom yum (2.5/5) too sweet but had two shrimps in it and plenty vegetables 
-Grabong (3.5/5) pretty good but not for me
-khao sai (3/5) VERYY creamy and a bit too heavy for me but the noodles were good and the chicken was tender even after reheating
-chef nuit pad Thai (4.5/5) I got it with beef and Thai spicy. WARNING IT IS RLY SPICY. I'm Chinese and used to Sechuan spiciness but this brought tears to my eyes. Def get medium spicy to begin with even if you think you can handle spice!!! 
Overall pretty good but I was hoping to try their papaya salad since it's my absolute favourite dish but it seemed sold out online in kits via ubereats",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Oriel M.,"Just had dinner here and was satisfied. 
The service is great, everyone was attentive, quick, and pleasant. Atmosphere is nice, it's actually not that loud and you can hear the person across from you. Very busy, so make a reservation if you can. Food also came out a good time, not that long of a wait. 
We ordered the Tom Yum soup as a starter, great flavors - I love the spicy and sour flavors battling it out in my mouth. 
My partner had the Pad Thai, we both found it to be sweeter than we liked, but it was a good portion size (especially for sharing) and fresh. 
I had the Khao Soi with braised beef. Really yummy if you like coconut curry with beef and egg noodle. Portion of this was also pretty decent. Good for sharing as well. 
To drink we had the Thai Iced tea, really flavorful and not overly sweet. 
I would come back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kat J.,"This is one of my favourite Thai places. I love the vibe of it! It's like walking into another world. Super colourful and lively! 
The pad Thai there is my favourite. I've tried them all. I can't pick a favourite. They do great curries as well and their drinks are to die for. You feel like you're on vacation here. 
Great to get take too though to bring home. 
I have a wonderful experience every time I go. 
Fun to go with friends or on a date. Might be too loud to go with older parents.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vince L.,"Love this place. The service is always great and food tastes amazing. And because of that you need to either make reservations in advance or go at odd times, otherwise you gotta wait for their food. 
I think they've recently expanded too so maybe that helps a little. I say at the small patio outside their main entrance this time and it was fine. Portions are typically generous and full of flavour. There are times when I'm so full from lunch here that I don't even want to eat dinner.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eunice S.,Not good food. It sucked. It didn't taste good at all. Never going back with my kids again.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joseph A.,We loved it!  From hostess to bartenders to wait staff it was amazing. The food is the best we've had since before the pandemic!!  Absolutely loved everything about this place and would highly recommend it. Only negative was most of their taps were out but still a good selection of drinks. Try the Spicy P drink!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joy H.,"I have very mixed feelings about Pai.
We came in just before the dinner rush on a Tuesday. There was a small wait but we got a table pretty fast considering it's popularity. We hadn't decided what to get just yet, when someone came to take our order. We told them we'd need a bit more time, but it became quite difficult to get anyone to take our order after that (eventually we did of course). 
We ordered the grabong, chef nuit pad Thai with beef, pad gra prow with chicken, and khao soi with chicken. 
The grabong was amazing! Really interesting to look at and had a great flavour and slight crunch. It's a great appetizer to share and tastes great with or without the sauce. I would definitely recommend trying this!
The chef nuit pad Thai was pretty good. Really nice all round flavour and not overly sour--a really good balance between sweet and sour! This was a favourite of ours as well.
The pad gra prow is where things begin going downhill. The rice was hard in some places--and not in the ""crunch bits at the bottom of the rice cooker"" way, but more like a stale ""we left this out on the counter for half a day"" type of way. The chicken and egg on the dish were very standard. The whole dish just felt very lackluster and sad. If you want to eat this, go to any Vietnamese restaurant instead.
The khao soi also had mixed feelings. The coconut curry itself was very delicious and rich--but almost too rich. It was definitely one of those foods that feel very heavy on the stomach after only a few bites. The egg noodles inside were also VERY soft--like it was overcooked and mushy. I think it would be better if the noodles were a little more al dente.
There are lots of hit and misses with Pai, which makes me hesitant to come back and try new items. The only thing I'm sure of is I would definitely recommend the grabong.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Richard N.,"My friend took me here to celebrate after an amazing interview (spoiler alert: I didn't get the job). Let's get this straight, I'm not well versed with Thai cuisine besides Pad Thai, so I didn't have much expectations. The restaurant is generally very busy but we somehow managed to avoid the traffic. Though if you are waiting in the lobby, I recommend reading the owners' story on the wall (It's adorable).
I ordered their Khao Soi and it was fantastic! The soup was rich and had a bit of heat, the perfect combination! The beef was also so tender. Because of that experience, I now order Khao Soi whenever I am at a Thai place but none have lived up to Pai's.
If you're looking for a new Thai place, a new date spot, or somewhere to celebrate your new job, buckle up and get ready to fall in love with Pai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tony R.,"It was really busy like always but we were able to get a table. The food and service are always on point, James really took care of us and made it a great night!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mo B.,"As i was eating there I was thinking Pai was very similar to Sabai Sabai and Khao San and then i found out that they are apparently owned by the same owners so no wonder there. Unlike other Thai places the menu is minimal with only a few options listed but the food is great. I tried their Khao San and loved it. I know it has noodles but i would still get a side of rice since i really like the flavorful broth and could still eat that with the rice. Also the bowl by itself wouldn't fill me up. Unlike other Thai restaurants that I've been too, the prices are also higher.
Food: 4.5/5
Service and atmosphere: 4/5
Price: 3.5/5
Overall: 4/5",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katie Z.,"10/10 I would visit again
Got the recommendation from a local and so glad we visited! 
Super cool decor and very friendly staff. 
My date ordered a Thai iced tea and loved it! I enjoyed the sangria, it's homemade and delicious. 
I had the chicken pad Thai and would recommend it. 
.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura S.,"Awesome and authentic Thai restaurant with a dope hipster vibe.
Came here with 2 coworkers around 8 pm on a weeknight and had to wait about 30 minutes, but worth it! It's actually pretty spacious if they take you to the back room area.
Grabong is the perfect appetizer to share! It's a bundle of fried squash fritters with a delicious dipping sauce.
I got the braised beef khao soi dish as my entree. The noodles were perfect and it was nice to have braised beef in a Thai dish, which isn't the norm.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melissa C.,"I came here on a Saturday for dinner with a large group. We made reservations ahead of time because our group was over 9 people. When we arrived it was packed at the front and I knew the food would be amazing.
I had the Khao Soi with beef. The presentations was nice with lots of dry crispy noodles poking up from the rich flavoured curry. It was mildly spicy but it was just right for myself. The server was very helpful and made small conversations with us.
Overall a wonderful experience and I definitely will be back to try other dishes. Perhaps I'll try a drink next time too!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thomas L.,"Heard locally that this was one of the best Thai places in Toronto so had to give it a try!
The vibe of the restaurant was definitely pub-like. However it was a very friendly place and the service was excellent. The only downside was the food was alright.
We ordered basically everything on the menu to try such as the Tom yum soup, pad Thai, the fish, panang chicken and etc.
The food wasn't very hot in general and it's presentation seemed either rush or just no real effort in presenting the dish. 
However it was a very fun experience, and a great place to kick it around with friends",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Layla A.,"This place is BIG but it's also PACKED so be prepared. We came here for a friends dinner party. If you have a group of more than 8 people, I strongly recommend making res otherwise you're going to be waiting foooorever. 
The service and servers in general are quite nice but kind of slow. You can't come here, hope to be seated quick, eat and leave. This is a camp out. Literally. 
I got the Tum Yum flavoured soup with shrimps. It's was okayyy. There were a lot of tomatoes. Like 11 and I'm not a fan of tomatoes. However, the portion size was quite big. I didn't finish it because it was shareable. And it comes with this flame thing to keep it warm which was nice. 
My friends tried a whole bunch of other stuff that they really liked. And everything is practically under $20 for large portions which is nice. 
The atmosphere is also nice although it can get loud real quick. Also, there are stairs that lead down so if you have kids in strollers be ready to carry.  
Overall a good experience.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela C.,"Haven't even tasted the food because I've been waiting for an hour after being told it would be a 25 minute wait. Apparently the restaurant staff are incapable of asking table squatters to leave. 20 minutes ago we were told that this table was finished eating and we would be able to be seated shortly and yet, where are we? Not seated. Waiting. Starving. Confused. :( 
Will update if food was worth.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angelica A.,"Pai has one of the best Pad Thai I've ever had (no ketchup was used). It's crunchy and flavourful. I really like the ambiance and the music they play. Always crowded but with very good reason. 
The service is always quick at lunch time and my plate is always empty within five minutes of the server putting it on the table.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Benzi Y.,"Staying around the downtown core really has it's benefits.  One of them, is that you get to try all the modern and trendy restaurants that are making waves in the community.  Good friend of mines mentioned that this place would be amazing, and after experiencing the food myself, I have to say that it is pretty stellar.  I have been to quite a few thai resturants in my lifetime as well as travelled to Thailand quite a few times and will validate the authenticity of the food here is pretty much as good as you can get in Toronto.  
One thing to note is that this place is always busy and you are going to be expected to wait at least 30-40 mins if you do not beat the rush after work that comes down here to experience the vibes of this place.  The neat thing is that they have a waiting area/bar that you can chill in an have drinks, until a spot becomes available as well as seats to rest if you need it after a long day of work.  Friends and I were lucky and only waited 15 mins or so before they opened the back (I heard it only opens after a certain period of time) and we got to go in.
We had a few appetizers which included the lemongrass chicken wings and I had my rice with egg and crispy pork which I think was a good choice in hindsight.  Their pork skewers were also amazing and probably won the appetizer of the night as we had a few and probably one of the better skewers I have ever had.  Overall, the vibes were nice, service was good and food was great and hence, will definitely come back to try the many different things on their menu.  
On a side note, relatively on the expensive side for Thai food, but I guess you get what you paid for.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Curt D.,Very good food.  Fun place... decor and food aren't connected but both were very good in their own way.  About 1 hour wait but worth it.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gwen N.,"Currently my favourite Thai spot in Toronto! I've been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. I've ordered most of the dishes on the menu so I'l only mention my highlights. 
Papaya salad - Huge serving compared to other places I've been to. The aroma and flavours are all reminiscent of SE Asia, with very strong and bold flavours. I got the salted crab variation and there were many pieces of crab included. I was expecting maybe 2-3 pieces! The pork rinds are also a welcome touch of texture. 
Sai Ua Platter (Northern Thai Sausage) - pork sausages, sticky rice and a Thai relish that reminded me of a Vietnamese noodle soup called bun rieu. Sausages had a balanced taste of all the spices and went well with the relish. Sticky rice acted as a good palette cleanser between the salty items. 
Gaeng Hunglay Ox Tail - an oxtail curry that was so tender. A perfect entree dish! 
Other items that are my usual favourites include the pad thai, khao soi, and pa gra prow, however, these are dishes you can get at the other Chef Nuit restaurants. 
Reservations are recommended (if you can get them) but they do allow walk-ins. I've never had to wait longer than 30 mins for a walk-in. Parking is hard to find during peak hours so I would recommend public transit if you can. Service is always friendly but can be a bit slow at times.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,May T.,"Definitely worth the wait!!!
I believe we waited about 30-45 minutes for just us two people. They served us drinks at the bar side table. 
We got sat down at the back of the restaurant and might I say.... THIS RESTAURANT IS HUGE!!!!! 
We ordered the famous cold dish that wraps the betel leaf with garlic, shallots, ginger. Pomelo, peanuts, lime and spicy chili. Added with that is roasted or toasted coconut shred and it was so good! Value $15.
Then the green curry was absolutely amazing. It came in a coconut which was so cool! 
It tasted less salty than usual places which is great for me. But it was real spicy! So good though. I must come back to try more food!!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Evie M.,"I came on a Thursday afternoon at 4, right when they begin serving dinner. We were seated right away with no wait, but by the time we left at 5 there was already a line forming!
We ordered the beef rendang ($16) and the khao soi with chicken breast ($16.50). The waitress asked us if we wanted to share, and brought plates and bowls so we could eat family style.
The rendang was my favourite. The sauce had a really strong basil flavour, and the thinly sliced meat and peppers helped keep it light. It came with a large bowl of rice, which was great to soak up the curry. 
The khao soi was also fantastic. The egg noodles soaked up the curry and the crunchy noodles on top were really tasty dipped in the sauce. The chicken could have been more juicy, but we did order chicken breast. I also would have preferred more vegetables. 
The meal came with chili oil, lime, and pickled greens as sides. I also ordered a Thai tea, which was about the size of a large bubble tea.
Definitely the best Thai restaurant I've been to in Toronto! Great value for the quality, but come early if you don't want to wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jonny M.,"I really wanted to try one of the popular northern Thai places while I was in town but seeing as we didn't have any reservations, I didn't think we had a good chance of getting into Pai. But then again, it was an early Thursday evening so we gave it a shot. Turns out we got to Pai just before the dinner rush and we're able to put our name down on the list before it got crazy. The wait was only 25-30 minutes!
The inside had me reminiscing about my travels back in Chiang Mai. The decor is a nice balance between cool hipster and Thai market/street food style. The place is bustling, the crowd young and filled with chatter. If you can, sit out on their patio outside.
So many cool drinks. They even have Thai buckets! The whole menu sounded delicious. We were having a hard time narrowing it down to three dishes for the two of us. Four spice levels to choose from! Mild, medium, farang (foreigner spicy) and phet mak mak (Thai spicy). Genius.
- Grabong ($12.50) - vegetarian deep fried battered squash fritters with a garlic tamarind dip. Seemed like everyone around us was getting this as their starter so we did the same. The squash fritters were piled high - nicely battered and crunchy but the dip is what makes this dish. Magic. Wish they had a half size option as this dish is massive and way too much for two people to share.
- Chef Nuit pad thai ($15.00) - stir fried rice noodle in a homemade tamarind sauce with bean sprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts. Noodles had a nice chewy texture to them and the tamarind sauce was perfect. Not too sweet, tangy. This was pretty legit.
- Gaeng hunglay ox tail ($15.00) - sweet and sour ox tail ginger curry. Served with steamed jasmine rice. Ox tail is always good in my books but I don't think I've ever had it Thai style. The curry was rich and heavy but the ginger helped cut down the richness somewhat. Meat was succulent and tender but there was a bit more bone that I would have liked.
We rolled out of Pai stuffed to the brim but extremely satisfied with our meal. Next time, I'll be sure to bring more friends out to try way more things. I'd be happy to eat my way through Pai's menu!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shelley P.,"Hands down the best Thai food restaurant. Had the chicken pad Thai, and the beef khao soi. The khao soi was SO good I would def come back. 
- Khao soi-Fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions 
- Chicken pad Thai was decent.
- Sangria was unique, tasted like it's got some guava juice or something like that, nonetheless it was super good
 
Parking was a nightmare as usual in central downtown, but there is parking right next to the restaurant for convenience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeffrey T.,"I feel like luck was on our side when we walked into this place (without a reservation) on a Friday night. We wanted to take our chances and ask how long the wait was for a party of 6... low and behold they had a table open in the next 5 minutes! WOW. I was definitely surprised at what they had just told me, but I'm not complaining.
We ordered pretty much all their popular dishes, and man oh man did my taste buds enter a whole new world. I've never had Thai food so different, yet SO GOOD. They have such a different twist on Thai food, I would eat this everyday if I could. I don't know what they put in their dishes, but everything was amazing. It's been a while since I've tasted something so authentic yet so modern. This spot is has to be on the top of my list when visiting Toronto. I'm so glad we came here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia H.,"Been wanting to take my hubby here for awhile now and we finally made it!
We were so lucky that we were able to get seated right away on a Wednesday night with no reservation. Part of it was because they have now expanded their location so there is a back part that you can also now sit at. Perfect for private parties if anyone is looking :p
There is another bar in the back and we choose to be seated at the bar so there was no waiting time. If we wanted a table, it was still a quick wait - 15-20 mins (not bad for Pai).
Since we finally made it here, we tried to order as much as we could without looking like pigs (:P)
We tried:
- thai wings
- Grabong (buttercup squash fritters)
- Som Tum Tad (Papaya Salad) with Salted Crab
- Pad Thai
- Gang Kiaw Wan (in a coconut): green curry
the wings are very flavourful - really good. 
The grabong is light and not oily and HUGE. Definitely a sharing item
We were disappointed with the papaya salad as it was very fishy tasting and the crab was not that great... it made it even more fishy. But we wanted to try the crab since we have not seen it on other menus before.
as always, the pad thai was amazing. the green curry was really good too, it's so cute that they serve it in a coconut...
We were too full to have dessert, so can't comment about that!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wesley H.,"I have tried to go dine in for several years but always ended up not able to.
However, during this covid time, I have ordered from Pai many times. My favorites are the chicken wings and pad Thai.
The wings are so delicious I can eat lots of them. They are slightly spicy hot but very tender.
Pad Thai is amazing. I usually order medium heat level with chicken. Very tasty and one order is very filling. I have been venturing into farang spicy. It's still good but I think medium is more palatable for my system. I dare not order Thai spicy lol
When it is possible to dine in again, I will try go and experience the ambience too",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt A.,"This and Khao San Road are my go to places for Thai. I don't know the details but rumour is they both used to be owned by a couple, and when they split up the result was these two separate restaurants. They are both epic. The chicken just tastes better and has a better texture than any other thai place I know.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arielle G.,"Pai is by far the best Thai food I've had in Toronto. The food is top notch and the service is always good!
It's always super busy but don't let that stop you as the wait times are never long. If you want a reservation you have to book far in advance!
Some of my favourites are the pad Thai and the soup. Every dish I've tried there has been great.
I also love the decor! Super fun and modern!! You can get some great photos.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sharon F.,"It's always Pai VS Khao San Road and I am Pai fan. I like their curries better and their pad thai is saucier and more flavourful than Khao San Road.
I would say that the line ups are ridiculous here considering how many years this place has been opened for so go early or go have a drink while you're waiting.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kayo T.,Had by far the best Pad Thai here! Service was fast too. Wish they had a few locations across Toronto...,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mandi D.,"Their food is amazing! I won't hear for lunch for work the first time but unfortunately I couldn't get through due to the long wait    
I ordered the Pad Graw Prow via Ritual 30 mins before lunch and when I finally got my food and it tasted really good and it was worth the $20 I spent on my meal 
I would definitely come back to either dine or take out lunch/dinner!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James L.,"Extremely popular spot downtown, always full of energy and the food is pretty consistent. Although I don't rate restaurants based on their service, I'd note that the service here is great and the atmosphere is great.
Definitely recommend getting a bunch of dishes to share, instead of ordering your own stuff. Food tastes authentic, portions might be a little small.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Saumya S.,Always full and you need to wait for really long if you're a walk in. The pad Thai noodles have an option to select the spice level and I had the extreme one and omg it was out of the world! Crazy good!! Their khow suey is good too. Definitely want to dine in sometime soon!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ranjeet M.,Love this place and all Chef Nuit and Jeff Regular's spots across the city. Great food and great atmosphere! Any of this duo's restaurants is worth the experience. :),5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dave C.,"Good place and good food. Enjoyed the Pad Thai, Chicken Wings and the Papaya Salad. 
Our server was also very pleasant. Foodservice was quick and fresh.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karen Z.,"Amazing food, but LONG waits. Arrived at 9pm on a Saturday night and waited for 1 hour before being seated for 2 people.
Food wise, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The chicken skewers are AMAZING - the sauce adds amazing dimensions of flavours, especially with the cucumber.
So if you're willing to wait and passionate about good Thai food, try this place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maya E.,"One of the best Thai restaurants I have been to to date. Came across this restaurant while visiting Toronto with my family. Keep in mind there will likely be a line out the door (and I do not believe they take reservations) but the line does move fairly quickly and the food is well worth the wait. We ordered a bunch of dishes to try / share and everything was delicious. My personal favorites were the Pad Thai (w/ Shrimp) and the Grabong appetizer, but again, all the dishes were great and worth trying. Also, the service here was fantastic - food arrived quickly to our table and our waitress was super friendly. If I am ever in Toronto again, I will most definitely be back",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Donna S.,"This Thai spot is consistently delicious and to add to it, they TAKE RESERVATIONS!!
It is our favourite Thai place in Toronto - the Kao Soi (curry noodle soup) and Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup are 2 of my fave dishes. The Pad Gra Prow is served with the perfectly cooked egg on the side.  Another bonus is that they also deliver via Uber eats!",5

These are my favourite items on the menu :) Definitely my go-to Thai spot in downtown Toronto",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carly W.,"I read reviews on this place and wants to check it out. I sat at the bar by myself. There were at least 4 bartenders/servers at the bar. The drinks looked pretty good but I did not get one. I started off with tom yum soup because there were so many pictures of it online I thought it had to be a must get here. I was so happy I got it, it was so dang good. I want more now. Lol. It is not for the weak soul, as it has some good spice to it. I would compare to a hot spicy level. It was the best tom yum I've ever had. So many flavors and you could taste very ingredient. I was expecting good but was surprised with how impressed I was. This seemed very authentic. 
Then, I was stuck on what to get becuase there were 3 dishes I wanted. I asked my server his recommendation, he told me to go with the khao soi. This was amazing. It is a curry that filled my soul to the core. The spice level was perfect and came with chili oil in the side to add if wanted. I would come back here any day. My server was super nice too, attentive and was on point with the recommendations. I already can't wait to come back!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tanya A.,"Shockingly disappointing....
I have had Pai in the back of my mind almost all of 2017 since they were voted best Thai restaurant on blogTO. My usual Thai is Khao San road but I was happy to snag a 9 PM reservation two months before some family visiting. 
However, that anticipation and satisfaction of delicious Thai street food was sadly crushed as the food was completely average. We got soup, Khao soi, kad pra gra, and pad Thai and all dishes were just okay. Flavor was lacking and I was surprised to hear that they couldn't make Khao soi spicy. I understand that it's a coconut base so it's hard to spice it up but it is still definitely possible, as other restaurants would prove.
Ambiance of the restaurant is super nice and customer service was really good.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Reenga M.,"Loved this place ... although I had only the market hall experience I would totally come back here again! Brought my dad here for a weekday lunch and the place was packed there was a 15 min wait time that we both. Pulsar fit into out schedules since we had to run back to work meetings ... as we were about the leave the waitress told me about the  market hall option it's basically the same food but we don't get too many options so my dad
Got the red curry and friend eggplant with rice I got mine with the green curry ... the red curry as a tad bit better than the green but both were excellent ... my dad is very picky but he himself said we need to come back here again!!! Recommend it ! Hoping to be back here to taste good from the regular menu",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin B.,"I finally got around to checking this place out. Pai is super popular, so it gets very busy during dinner time. I'd highly recommend you make a reservation - otherwise you'll be waiting easily over half an hour for a table.
The restaurant is huge on the inside and runs like a well-oiled machine. Everything from getting a table to getting your food to getting the bill is designed to handle a LOT of customers. The atmosphere inside is very loud and boisterous - not quite bar levels of rowdy, but certainly not a good place for finding some peace and quiet.
Food-wise, they have quite a few good-looking Thai dishes. I tried the moo ping (pork skewers) and the gaeng kiaw wan (green coconut curry) with fish. They were both delicious. Portion sizes are a bit on the smaller side (aka they're normal-sized, rather than oversized like most restaurants). There's also a nice selection of interesting cocktails and drinks, though I didn't try any.
Overall the experience was fun, and the food was tasty. I wasn't a huge fan of just how big and loud the restaurant was - at times it felt like the restaurant was just herding cattle. But if you don't mind the crowds and the noise, then check this place out sometime.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rehab K.,"Best Thai food in Toronto - I think the only downside is it's a bit pricey specially for comfort food but none the less, worth the splurge.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wallace L.,"A staple for Thai food in Toronto for as long as I can remember. Great atmosphere and selection of food. My favourite is the Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork with a Thai iced tea on the side. A couple of notes though, 1) they fill up fast for dinner so it's good to plan your visit. 2) lunch dine in wasn't available last time I went but this might have changed by now. 3) if ordering through their online system, there are sometimes items shown to be available when they actually aren't, or it's missing a dish that they serve in restaurant.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clairy W.,Great place. Really authentic Thai food.  One of few only in downtown Toronto. Highly recommended if you can bear the wait.  Folks are lining up before it's even opened.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sabrina D.,"The foood here is incredible. The quality is outstanding especially in the curries. The lines to waiting for a table are insane!! I remembered the first time i came a few years ago the line went from the restaurant all the way down to King St. and had to wait 45 minutes. We ordered Pad Thai, Khao Soi, Masaman Curry etc. All are amazing dishes with their own flavors of sweet and spice mixed together. Everytime I come to toronto I have to come here at least once. The owner came to our table and was very nice. Love coming here.
Highly recommend and you can't go wrong with anything you order from here",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason L.,"This place was delicious! In Toronto just for the day, really wanted Thai food and was steered here by yelp with good results! It was busy on a Saturday afternoon but we easily got a tables. I had the Khao Soi, which was amazing, savory, and the beef was tender. The green curry came in a coconut and was deliciously tasty. Definitely worth a stop!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole T.,"Pai is well known across Toronto and sometimes it is so hard to get a table during peak time. I would definitely recommend going early if you don't want to wait. If you don't mind waiting, you can put your phone number down and walk around and they'll text you when your table is ready, which is great so you don't have to wait around in the waiting area.
My go-to orders are the thai iced tea, pad thai, spring rolls and squash fritters.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amyn H.,"Incredible food, they actually  had some Burmese dishes on the menu too!  The curries weeds flavorful without being  too spicy.  My family and I loved the ambiance!! I recommend the Khow Suey!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,C W.,"Unusual place. Noisy basement pub style joint, jammed with people on a cold snowy night. One spot left at the bar. Must be good right?
Yup. The real thing. I only had two dishes, but saw lots of awesome looking stuff come out of the kitchen. My Tom Yum Soup was surprisingly sweet but was fresh and lemongrassy with an awesome kick of chillies.
Gaeng Masaman was the best I've had in Canada. Really deep and complex with big chunks of nice tender beef, not the slices you normally see in this country.
Took me back to Chiang Mai. I'm going to eat the whole menu if it takes me 10 Trips...",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chrissy S.,"Went here 3 years ago for the first time, and honestly made the trip back to Toronto today with pai first thing on the to do list!!! Best hands down Thai food in the world!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ken C.,"By far. And I mean BY FAR (miles and miles) the best Thai restaurant I've been to in my life. Ever single dish was amazing. So rich and flavorful it was unbelievable. It was definitely worth the 1 hour wait. We sat in a room (traditional style with shoes off) and it made the experience a whole lot better. Also, they had $5 Jameson shots. What a great deal. The server was explaining that they actually bring in fresh ingredients from overseas and try their best to keep it 100% authentic. Good vibe inside the restaurant and overall had a great experience. I would definitely come back in a heartbeat.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Helene P.,"The place was jamming! My friends got us a table early in but once we were seated the service came by quick, meals even quicker and the service was excellent - given that there were so many customers in the restaurant. The food was yummy!!!! I got the Khao Soi and my friend the Yom Yum... they were well done, the playing was amazing and I couldn't get enough! I would definitely make this my spot when going to the theatre.... the prices were also amazing for the amount of food you get!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Esmond T.,"The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great. The Miang Kung was a fun starter for the group. Everyone made their own wraps with the ingredients, it was flavourful and fresh. 
The green curry was also very well done. Flavours were on point and not too spicy",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Partho S.,"A favourite in Toronto. Quick, reliable, and pretty accessible. Has all the things you need in a good restaurant (good food, nice ambience, front row seats to some of the worst first dates this city has ever seen).",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Donnis M.,"Second visit inside 7 days. Great food and a neat vibe. Be very careful with the ""Thai Spicy"" heat level. Delicious, but you'll pay for it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Winnie Y.,"This place never disappoints. I love it ! The portion is a good size, the taste is amazing , and the decor is always on point. I love the variety of seatings from the stage (where you sets cross legged, bar, high table and low table.
The feels are amazing for a great chill place to eat with friends. The price is very reasonable and affordable. 
The only thing I would recommend is plan ahead and RSVP or be prepare to wait in line. It's always crowded ha",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,G D.,"Pai delivers an incredible atmosphere but is hit or miss with its cuisine.
We shared two appetizers - papaya salad and spring rolls. The spring rolls were outstanding. They were well seasoned and were cooked perfectly. It was also accompanied by a delicious dipping sauce. The papaya salad, on the other hand, left much to be desired. It came with shrimp that was so over cooked it was certified inedible. 
The Khao Soi is a fantastic dish with golden curry, crispy noodles, and chicken breast. The curry is so aromatic and delivers a taste that dances on your tongue. I certainly recommend it! 
Overall, if you are looking for some decent food with a great vibe, this may be your place.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie N.,"I came to Pai for a late lunch and it was busy, but I was seated right away. I started with the tom yum soup which was small, but significant with 3-4 large prawns in it and a variety of veggies. It tasted very authentic, but for $7 I would have liked a bigger portion.
I got the khao soi with chicken leg (because dark meat is way better than white meat am I right?!) and my friend got the chicken pad thai. The khao soi was delicious, as was the pad thai. 
The service is great, my glass was never empty and they brought me a bowl for my bones without me even asking. The servers are very attentive, which can be hard in such a packed restaurant. Would be 5 stars if the portions were larger. You pay around the same price at Sukothai and get WAY more.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica G.,"We went to PAI on a Friday evening, around 7:30, and it was packed! Despite how busy it was, we were seated immediately which was a nice surprise.  At the recommendation of my boyfriend, who has been a fan of PAI for a while, we ordered the Khao Soi (with beef), the Chef Nuit Pad Thai (with chicken), and the vegetable spring roll starter.
All the food was DELICIOUS. We got the pad thai with medium spice and it was so yummy, not overpowering at all. In future, I'd probably get the Khao Soi myself since it was my favourite of the three. Unfortunately, we didn't get to try the mango sticky rice which I heard was incredible so I'll definitely have to go back for it. 
The portion sizes were very large (tons of leftovers!) and the service was prompt and friendly. My only complaint was the wait time for our main dishes which was about 40 mins. It wasn't the end of the world, especially since the restaurant was super busy, but we were starving. 
Overall, I loved all the food and the ambiance. I'm really looking forward to trying more of the menu!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rita K.,"3.5 stars. We weren't blown away with the foods but this place does serve authentic Thai foods in Thai's true flavors. We arrived here late Friday evening towards 9PM and only had to wait half an hour. There were plenty of workers around to ensure everybody was served in a timely fashion. The restaurant was a bit dark with decor that reminds me of a good night out in an outside bar in Thailand (as if I've ever been to Thailand during my adulthood but I could imagine this). Lots of people dining in and waiting, so the noise level was pretty loud. Great ambiance though. 
The menu doesn't have a wide variety of items in comparison to the Thai restaurants you get back in CA. Which was a bit disappointing since we were craving other items. However. they serve a few key dishes (pad thai, meat with rice, noodles, etc) and they do it very well. We opted for the fried squash fritters, pad thai, and I got the ground pork on top of rice with egg (forgot the name). The fried squash fritters were really good! The batter does have a Thai taste to it and I thoroughly enjoyed indulging myself in its fried goodness. Plus it was huge too, we had some to pack for snack later on. The pad thai tasted authentic and not overly sweet like you would find at other places. My ground pork in basil and spicy sauce on top of rice was okay. It tastes like something my parents could make at a very steep price. I killed that in a handful of bites. I got the foreign hot spice level which was the second spiciest and it had a good burn, but it wasn't spicy enough that I felt uncomfortable. I would get the Thai hot next time! 
I remember seeing $14 to $15 for most dishes which I thought were very steep. The portions weren't hefty and the flavors were standard. Would we come back? Probably not but would recommend this place to others to try.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Toronto DailyLife ..,"Overall: If I could live in one restaurant, I would live here...
Price: It is more pricey than the other thai restaurants however, it makes up for the extra money in the taste. Easily Green Curry chicken is $17 but it comes in a coconut which I love. 
Portion: Portion is great, I am always full when I go here.
Taste: Out of this world. Drinks are pricey but it's downtown so fair
The Mango Sticky rice is amazing
Vegan ice cream delicious
Green curry chicken(only at dinner you get coconut) amazing
Papaya salad SMALL but delicious
chicken sate yummy
Fried Rice its good..
Khao Soi Very tasty
Squash fritters Different and good (very filling)
Service: Usually always good. Food comes out fast, their turn around is great because there's always a line.
Venue: Cute cozy, they renovated and made it very ""Thai"" which is awesome",5

Ambience: 4 Stars
We are so lucky here in Toronto to have so many amazing Thai restaurants to choose from. Pai is yet another great choice and if not for Khao San Road down the street I would be here more often.
I have been here many times now and have tried many of the items on their menu. My personal favourites are their Pad Thai and Khao Soi. Their curries are also very good (I have heard very good things about the Panang curry which I have yet to try myself). However I found the Pad Gra Prow and Thai Fried Rice to be very oily and the fried rice was very bland.
This place is always busy so either get here early before the lunch/dinner rush or make reservations. Even so the staff do a good job of getting you into a seat ASAP and are quick to take orders and bring your food. One thing to note is that a gratuity of 20% is added to your bill for parties of 6 or more.
The restaurant has quite a bit of seating and I really like the decor. One thing I noticed is that it is usually very loud. Many times it has been so loud that I can barely hear a person one seat away from me.
I definitely recommend this place as the food is great. Worth a try if you have yet to give this place a taste.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aarani P.,"I loved this place. Easily my new favourite Thai restaurant and I can see what all the rave reviews are about. We started with the spring rolls (best I've ever had), and then shared three main dishes: chicken pad Thai, pork pad gra prow and beef khao pad thamada. All of the dishes were so delicious that I was stuffed to the point I couldn't eat anymore (at which point I usually don't want to think about food for at least half a day), but this time I was craving more within the hour. The pad gra prow was definitely my favourite, the way the flavours all melded together was perfect. I had to try it mild because my friend doesn't do well with spicy good but I think it'd be even more delicious with a kick of spice in it. The other two dishes were good, but can't say they blew me out of the club water like this one.
We also had a pitcher of sangria which was decent.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David P.,"I had the Chef Nuit pad thai and the massaman shrimp. It was very good and better than most other Thai places I've tried. Warning: their ""thai hot"" is the real deal. Its West Indian hot.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kenny N.,"Good ol' yelp directed me here. The reviews are stellar and I was hungry, so it was an absolute no-brainer.
There's honestly nothing quite like Thai food (really good and homemade, that is) to comfort you during the cold winter. I love how the menu isn't too elaborate nor too simple because it gives you options without being overwhelmed. 
We started off with the northern Thai sausage (pork belly) and it came with sticky rice (yum!). 3 of the 4 of us went with their chef nuit pad thai (it's always a safe option to go with). Their portions are generous and reasonably priced as a result ($14-15 per main dish I believe). I went with the khao soi, which consists of fresh egg noodles in a delectable coconut milk curry. Seriously, if you're ever in a mood for real good curry, this is the dish to go for because the noodles are drenched in it. I wish there was some naan to dip though.. (lol). We thoroughly enjoyed every dish. 
Service was fantastic, with periodic check ups here and there. Always there when we needed something too. 
Guys, the reviews don't lie. This place is lit... for damn good reason.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Annie K.,"What time we arrived/Wait time?
We arrived on a Wednesday for lunch and it was PACKED. Always line ups here apparently. Go before you're hungry!!
Atmosphere?
It's super cute and creative. Love the history wall that shows how this restaurant came to be. Has a beautiful and authentic feeling to it. Not a lot of tables space though!
Service/Staff?
Service was fantastic!
Food/Menu?
Just get the simplest things on the menu and you'll be so impressed. The Pad Thai is still the best that I've ever tried in my life here. It's amazing. It's so savoury and a little spicy... has a kick to it that no other place has! It kinda reminds of me goreng (Indonesian food). The spring rolls were great too. They make everything taste amazing here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clea C.,"This is the place where I take my out of town friends! It's an iconic Toronto Thai restaurant and often has a long line up. It's recommended to avoid peak hour, especially if you're a big group. They have a part of seating where you take off your shoes and sit at a platform table. Super fun!
Some of my favorite dishes:
Grabong - Buttercup sqush fritters. It is a huge portion, and the taste is amazing with the dipping sauce!
Gaeng Kiaw Wan (in a coconut) - Delicious green curry! Try it with sticky rice, and scoop out the coconut flesh (tastes like jello :)
Pad Gra Prow - I love it with ground pork! The sauce to be drizzled on top of the dish makes it extra delicious!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sophie L.,Food is Yummm what a great pub and Thai food restaurant! Great service and Highly recommended!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elaine G.,"I've been to Pai twice and each time I ordered the Khao Soi. It's just such a safe option and crowd pleaser- the soup is savory and a little sweet, and the crunchy noodles mixed in with cooked noodles gives each bite a layered texture. Although it's not the best thing I've ever eaten, it's dependably delicious.
Also don't skip the garlic shrimp. I'll be back here.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sanita M.,"Amazing experience. I really liked the way they serve their dishes - so unique and interesting. I ordered a curry here and it was pretty good (but not the best). I took one star off because the green curry could be more flavourful and it was way too runny. I prefer thicker sauces with more veggies inside. However their Oad Thai was really good. The other reason why I probably won't come back so soon is the crowds - it is very loud here. It is not a place to go on a date (you won't hear each other unless you almost yell), or want to spend a quiet, relaxing time.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carlotta C.,"A nice casual yet sophisticated spot to go for Thai food in Toronto! The lines can be quite long but when I went it was actually very well taken care of and we waited very little time. We sat at the low tables, cross-legged on some pillow-very aesthetic but not the best to eat in, I must say. 
The place is in a basement with minimal lighting but that's part of the atmosphere. It is very loud, however, and because of the high traffic the waiters sometimes forget about you. My friends and I shared the spring rolls which were perfectly crunchy on the oustide yet soft on the inside- portion a little small for the $8.5 they charge you. 
Green curry was delicious! Would recommend.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roopesh D.,Excellent ambience! Can be romantic or can be with a group. Filling portions per dish and definitely worth the wait due to the chefs' skill in making sure the food is delicious,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sreekar K.,Probably one of the best Thai restaurants that I have ever been to.. this place is always busy and there is wait time at any given hour unless you are super early. tried their fried rice and pad Thai ..both are amazing and also did a few take out orders which tasted nothing different than a dine-in. Overall they keep up the quality of food and serve the same all the time!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arjun B.,"I got the Pad Gra Prow and it was delicious! I added some crispy pork belly to the mix and found it to be amazing! The minced pork was seasoned perfectly and the egg was just the cherry on top!
Overall, great place and great atmosphere! It feels like a bar more, than a restaurant, which isn't a bad thing! I would love to go drinking there sometimes!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer C.,"If you're looking to try ""authentic"" Thai food you gotta eat anything with shrimp paste it, and this is the very joint that has many dishes with it.
Annnd sadly I can't eat shellfish anymore but I grew up not allergic to shrimp, so I live to tell. Never mind. My heart is won over by the Chang Mai beef noodle for how limey and mouth-wateringly spicy it is. The thin threads of fine rice noodle held the hot and sour flavours so well. They also don't skimp on ingredients and gave me many tender beef shank chunks to stuff me full for the rest of the day. My partner had the shrimp khao soi and was equally impressed. We left with happy tummies.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Derek Z.,Amazing food and ambiance! Really recommend the khao soi and pad see ew if you love noodles! Also one of the best green curries in the city,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny H.,"If you want authentic Thai food Pai is one of the best for this. We went to Pai a few times for dinner and got takeout from here as well. Make sure to place a reservation beforehand though unless you want to spend your entire night in the lineup.
We usually order the Miang Kung (not pictured) and the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Chicken. The food itself is delicious but the drinks can be improved quite a bit. The sangria pitcher here tastes more like a fruit punch juice than a sangria. 
The environment is a bit crowded and you will probably end up hearing the conversation of the table next to you. Servers are friendly but with the volume of people the speed becomes a bit slow. 
Overall, if you are not in a rush and want to enjoy some authentic Thai food then I definitely recommend Pai. If you are in a hurry, then skip the line and grab some Thai Express.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jia I.,"Pai is a special place if you want to be transported to the south east Asia on a whim, and walk into a love story. It's always been consistent, beautiful, delicious, and romantic. What else do we want from a restaurant, and honestly what else do we want out of life, for real though? I have been visiting this place for quite a few years. In fact, I went on a taste-test spree to try all Thai places in the downtown Toronto area - and Pai was the bestest...

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yifu Z.,"the first meal I had after my 14 days of quarantine in toronto back in August! don't know if it was because I ate quarantine facility food for 2 weeks straight before, but this was probably the one of the best thai meals I've had in north america  these dish completely blew my usual order of tom yum or pad kee mao out of the water.
thai chicken wings (CAD $6)  juicy, tender, and flavorful chicken with a thin and crispy exterior. the tamarind sauce paired amazingly with the chicken. left eager for the next dish!!
khao soi with beef (CAD $17.50)  I've always loved thai curry but khao soi just never hit... until THIS KHAO SOI!! it hits sooo different. the broth is rich, creamy, and thick. the richness is balanced out by the spices and woweeee it was just   also the bowl was huge, so I obvi went for seconds... thirds... and fourths ahaha
pad gra prow with crispy pork (CAD $19.50)  another mind blowing dish... I'm gonna sound repetitive but I really was never into ""ground pork and rice"" dishes. but this one is no ordinary ground pork and rice!! there's basil, garlic, fish sauce, and lime layered in every bite of juicy pork and chewy rice. the crispy pork is indeed very crispy, but the meat is soft, juicy, and not too fatty.  also - I'd just like to add as someone who doesn't usually like to eat rice unless it's in sushi, this really made me want to go blue up every last grain.",5

I came here a few years ago for the first time and I couldn't get enough of it. I ordered the pad gra pow and it was absolutely delicious!! I came here again a few times afterwards and the most recent time in October, I felt like the quality of the food wasn't as great which is why I rated the food 4/5. Prices are jacked up and you need to book this restaurant at least 6 weeks in advance to be able to get the date that you want. It's insane!!!! Ambience is nice, tables are close together so you can't help but hear other conversations. Service was phenomenal I did really appreciate our server and her suggestions. Would come here solemnly but not regularly.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Claudia Y.,"Came here on a Tuesday night at 7pm with a reservation for a large group of 9 people. We had to wait about 15 minutes for our table though. We were put in a communal table and its busy in there. Its a bit dark and orangey lighting in there. But I love the hanging flags and decor. 
I got the tom yum soup - came with large shrimp which was good but the flavour was ok, could be stronger and hotter in temperature but it had more vegetables than other tom yums that I've tried so that was a plus. The mango sticky rice dessert was also great, no complaints tastes like what it is. The mango was sweet and the rice had good coconut flavour. I tried a bite of other people's food and it was all delicious. 
They have a good drink selection, the thai bucket is fun - comes in a small plastic sand pail with a handful of long straws where everyone can take a sip at the same time - great party starter! 
Service was prompt.  It an excellent place to start the night with the loud and hip crowd and music.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Annel B.,"We loved it. Great service and awesome and delicious food. Super clean and organized. The team knows.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica R.,"My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch while visiting Toronto during the Corona outbreak. The ambiance was so nice, the staff were very friendly and the food......OMG The food was absolutely delicious!!! I had the Pad Thai and my boyfriend had the curry. Both were soooo flavorful and plentiful. We had the chicken satay for an app and that too was fabulous!!!! Pai Northern Thai Kitchen will not disappoint. As I'm writing this my boyfriend is currently ordering takeout for tonight since the dining room is closed.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elliott R.,"When visiting any new city, talk to the locals ask them where they eat and what they like todo. Pai came up three times during our stay. After an hour's wait, we were seated at the bar, a great location to see all the food come from the kitchen. This by far was the best Thai food I have ever had. The service was great. The spice was appropriate and this was the BEST RECOMMENDATION we received in Toronto. Arrive not hungry so that the wait doesn't get the best of you, well worth it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dannie W.,This place is popular. There was a line to get in for dinner on Thursday night. The papaya salad is very good. It's a bit sour and spicy  it's very appetizing. Shrimp cracker is so good. It's probably the best I've tried. It has very rich shrimp flavor. The Pad Thai is ok to me. I would give it a 3.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Soleil S.,"If you're wanting great authentic Thai, have a lot of patience and head here ... the wait is long and constant.  If you're lucky and planned waaay ahead, you can score a Rez and slip pass the line up out the door.
Pai is Kiin's and Sabai Sabai louder and more vibrant sibling with its open Thai market feel.  Lights and flags hang about in the darker rustic dining space.  They really pack it in with maybe 10 inches between you and another table.  Service here is quick as they turn over the tables so fast to bring in more people.  
Thai iced tea - perfect drink for the summer.  Strong black tea compliments the sweetened condensed milk.  The milk gives a nice richness to the tea.  I love how this isn't watered down.  It is very sweet but it's not a bad thing here.  4/5 
Grabong (squash fritters) - A must get! This awesome app arrives nearly toppling over the plates.  Shredded squash is a maze of delicious crunch and crispy edges ... add the sweet Thai chili sauce and you'll definitely be eyeing every piece to sneak from your table mates.  5/5
Kung tawt sa-moon prai (garlic shrimp) - another excellent starter.  Big pieces of shrimp are batter and then deep fried up crispy.  They're not rubbery but still quite tender.  Warning to those on a date ... garlic is delicious but potent.  Bring a breath mint! 4/5
Pad Cha Hett (vegan stir fried mushrooms) - completely appreciate they have a vegan dish here.  It's authentic with its use of pungent fermented sauces.  My only issue ... it is just a handful of vegetables.  Maybe 10 pieces of snow pieces with the mushroom on top of a huge portion of rice.  3/5
Gaeng masaman (braised beef in a peanut tamarind curry) - large pieces of beef and potato float in a super flavourful curry that has a good dose of peanut and tamarind.  I really enjoyed the sauce in this one and found it much better in terms of value compared to the Pad Cha Hett. 4/5
Overall, awesome Thai meal that seems quite affordable at first but the value is a bit of a miss on a few dishes.  The apps are incredible though ... I'd come back for those alone!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alicia C.,"Love thai food and was very disappointed.
We were initially excited by the underground restaurant and cool vibe. Unfortunately the food was a huge let down. Our waitress' service was quite lackluster though other waitstaff were friendly and helpful.
The pad thai was not the best...nor even the second or third best. Not bad though.
The fried rice was unacceptable. My waitress' attitude seemed to imply I was ordering something boring. I didnt think about it until after I tasted my meal-- it was incredibly bland all around. If you're going to serve something as simple as fried rice, it should be banging...especially with a relatively concise menu. Even soy sauces and spicy chili oil barely helped this dish become satisfying.
Fried spring rolls were super duper good.
Thai Iced tea was difficult to drink with the crush ice and no straws (it's a straw free place which is cool but maybe not fully thought out)
I do not reccomend.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael M.,"Some of the best Thai food I have ever had. 
+ The pad Thai, tom yum soup, and the curry (I like the green curry) are so delicious!! Definitely recommend
+ There is a big menu with various appetizers and main dishes
+ Lines are long and there's usually always a wait unless you go here during non-peak hours or make a reservation
+ It gets quite loud in here so expect to raise your voice sometimes if you're talking within your table
+ Due to the popularity of the place, it can sometimes get a bit crowded inside and you may be sitting really close to the table beside you
+ They serve alcohol
This place will definitely not disappoint. 
Great place to try Thai food for the first time!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eric C.,"I've always held off coming to Pai because I thought it was always absolutely packed and that the difference in the quality of Thai food isn't worth that wait. But the verdict? After barely waiting on a weekend, the food is great here, and Pai is a great overall Thai restaurant. 
I was surprised how large this restaurant is. You enter and I only expected it to be a small place (think old Khao San Road) but then we got seated at the inner back area where it was a lot more bright and the music a lot louder. I was pleasantly surprised we didn't have to wait for an early dinner on a Saturday but could see the lines forming as we left. 
There were plenty of options on the menu which is great compared to some other Thai options in the city just sticking with the classics. I appreciate that this place tries to offer more rustic options. Prices are definitely on the steeper side but there's a certain refinement in the food here.
I had the privilege of trying a variety of dishes here. I'll start with the good. Chef Nuit's pad Thai is by far the best pad Thai I've had in the city. The balance is delectable; and the rice noodles were perfectly cooked with just the right amount of elasticity and chew. We went with the veggie pad Thai and it was loaded with tofu and veggies. It also had a nice stir fry taste (wok seared taste I call it) which added that smokiness. 
The Khao soi here was around average. I've definitely had better in the city. I felt it could have been more rich but appreciated the fact they gave the pickled mustard green on the side adding to the authenticity. The braised beef was somewhat dry but the fattier parts provided better balance.
I also tried the miang kung which was a betel leaf wrap. There was a nice mintiness to the leaf and a whole bunch of flavors going on with the coconut, the chilies, the garlic, and the sauces. It would be great to share but not to order as a main. I also tried the Kao pad thamada which was essentially like fried rice. The rice was really fragrant but was rather ordinary. 
Don't forget to order the Thai ice tea here, although pricey, it's a nice compliment to the meal especially if you can't handle the heat and soothes down your taste buds. It's creamy, rich, and sweet.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Israel S.,"BEST RESTAURANT IN TORONTO!!! If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Great atmosphere, great music, great service and amazing food. Favorite place I've eaten in Toronto. 
I love Thai food and have been to many many Thai restaurants especially in the states and all around this one was up on the top of my list. The restaurant has such an amazing vibe and so much culture infused into it. It's a cool underground spot, but it is huge. There usually is a crowd but it's well worth the wait. John was our server and he was awesome. Checked up on us often and explain the menu very well. It was really busy and the service was still great! 
Our food was delicious. This was my first time having northern Thai food so I wasn't used to some of the names of the dishes but very similar to regular Thai. Just with its own Pai twist. We ordered the chicken Pad Thai and the green beef curry in a coconut. Both very flavorful and delicious. I loved how the curry came in a coconut. Never seen it before and thought that was extremely cool. I had a Thai mojito, which came with like a purple pea leaf. It was really yummy. I love carbonated alcoholic drinks lol I call it tipsy soda. Also had the mango sticky rice for dessert which was the perfect treat.
The food was great. But the atmosphere of the restaurant was amazing!!!! To the decor, to the cool seating the have, to the intimacy of being so close and so many people. I love places like this, it's loud but it's a warm loud. Like it's cool everyone is mingling and enjoying each other and I loved it. The music was awesome too lol Felt like they were playing my playlist, old school/ 2000s hip hop and  R&B (: I swear everything about the place was just awesome. And the love story about how the place came about was just too cute. I'll post a pic. 
 10/5 Stars like it was TOO GOOD. Completely surpassed my expectations and went above beyond. This place has almost 5 stars for a reason. EVERY TIME I COME BACK TO TORONTO I WILL COME TO THIS PLACE. It's that amazing. Amazing",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gita R.,"This place is always bustling and there's good reason for that. The atmosphere is so fun, like being transported to a warm, faraway place, even on the coldest day.
The dishes I've had (green curry, fried fish with green curry sauce, Khao soi) were delicious and consistent from visit to visit. 
Arrive early for lunch to secure a table as the place fills up fast. Also place your order ASAP after you're seated (if you're waiting for others in your party, order for them if possible) otherwise it can take some time for the staff to return.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Irene H.,"Before anything, this restaurant is very popular so expect a lineup, especially if you decide to come on a weekend for dinner. After telling our host how many people, you will receive a text whenever your table's ready. Surprisingly, we didn't wait too long; roughly 30 mins? 
There are two menus; one for food and one for drinks. For the food options, there are a good selection of appetizers, noodles, and curry etc to choose from. I ordered:
- Gaeng Klaw Wan in a Coconut ($17.50): essentially this is the green curry inside a coconut. You pick your protein which is between beef, chicken, fish or tofu/veggies and spiciness level (mild/medium). It comes with a bowl of rice. Wow, the portion itself was pretty big which is great considering the price you're paying for. I'm not sure is it because of the coconut but the curry definitely tasted much more sweeter. I got mild and luckily that was my choice because there was still a ping of spiciness (which was fine with me). There's a good portion of chicken inside as well. Loved this dish!
- Fresh coconut water ($6): Although it didn't really come in any fancy cup, this is definitely worth getting. One sip and you can instantly tell that it's not artificial coconut water but one that came from a real coconut. Very refreshing!
- Thai Iced Tea ($5.75): Wow, it was very flavorful and tasty. There was a hint of sweetness but not a lot to the point it overwhelmed the drink. Definitely recommended. 
Service was really nice as our servers were very patient with our questions and tried to explain as much as she can to help us. They would come and check if our dishes were fine and of course, fill up water whenever our cups were starting to get empty.
Will come back again for sure, love this place :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kenny P.,"My friends and I came to Toronto for the weekend and our first stop was rhis Thai restaurant and boy wa sit worth it. Awesome atmosphere, delicious food and tasty drinks too! We just yelped for food around our air bnb and this trendy little spot popped up. If you're looking for authentic Thai food with an awesome atmosphere, definitely come here",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sumayya H.,"Super packed on a Monday evening. Grateful for the coat hangers. It's the small things.
Two of us split the pork skewer appetizer. VERY  good with a slightly sweet taste. My friend liked her pad thai. I always end up getting pad thai so opted for the Thai fried rice. It was good enough and comforting but I probably should have paired that with a curry etc. Portions are massive; there's no way you can finish one main per sitting. Service was OK; fine in the beginning, but then we had to wait for 15 minutes to place a takeout order, another 10 minutes to get our bill. After dropping off the bill the server sprinted away before we could ask for the machine. Add another 5 minutes.
Will be back to try the fritters though.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Miranda M.,"This place is incredible. I'm a huge fan of Thai food and I can always appreciate bold and deeply flavourful food creations.
After being highly recommended to us, 6 of us decided to go in at about 2pm on a Tuesday, it was busy when we arrived but not busy enough where we had to wait for a table. 
----The Details & Food----
The atmosphere was very neat and inviting, nicely laced with A/C. Our waitress Nicole was very attentive and knowledgable about the menu, which is always appreciated. 
We started with drinks: 
Thai Ice Tea & Lemongrass Ice Tea:
Both were SO freaking delicious!! It's hard to choose a favourite. I guess I can separate their greatness by saying the lemon grass one is so refreshing and it's a must if you feel parched or hot, and the Thai Ice Tea is very sweet and flavourful but almost heavy in comparison. Both very different, but So so good. 
I ordered the wings as an appy then ordered the Green Curry with Chicken as my main.
All the food was so incredible and the depth of flavour was unbelievable!! My dish had bamboo shoots in it and I generally don't enjoy them but I absolutely loved the way they prepared them and included in the dish. I loved the coconut milk green curry sauce.. I love it so much I dreamt about bathing in it haha. Kidding .. not .. maybe lol. 
It was just beyond incredible.
The location, ambiance, service, drinks and food, I really loved all of it. Everyone agreed, too. Next time I'm in Toronto I will certainly be paying a visit!! 
M.M.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Veronica H.,"This has to be one of my favourite Thai places
Cozy basement ambiance, although it can be quite loud especially when it is busy/crowded during lunch and weekends. 
Service was alright, could be better. They always seem like they're rushing you to get out just so they can accommodate other patrons waiting for the next table. 
My go-to dish is most definitely the khao soi with chicken. It NEVER DISAPPOINTS. The broth itself is very thick, creamy, heavy coconut flavour - hits the spot every time. The noodles is soft yet has a slight bite. Decent amount of chicken pieces. After eating the noodles, there is still quite a bit of broth leftover... don't put it to waste! Pro-tip: ask for a bowl of rice to soak up all that goodness.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michele L.,"Update:
Friday 7pm. BUSY! There was a line to get in line to wait to be seated. Unreal. They have the main dinning room, the 3 side dinning areas. The wait really wasn't that bad! 
We were seated at 8pm and for our food by 830. 
We ordered the coconut and Tom yum soup. Almost every table ordered it too. Can't go wrong! Plenty of fish and shrimp for the value!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maria C.,"I was lucky to try this place as my friend had made reservations months - yes you read that right, months! - early in advance for this place when I planned to visit Toronto. I didn't understand why the reso was needed for a Thursday night but when I got there and saw the crowds of people standing by the entry way, I was thankful for our reso. 
There are various types of seating at this restaurant including high tables with high chairs, regular tables, and also traditional sitting areas where you have to basically sit on the floor cross legged. If you are picky about how you sit, I would make sure to note this when making resos. 
The restaurant overall had a very bar/pub like feel and was extremely loud, which was not what I expected at all given the need for resos and the high reviews. The restaurant was quite big though, and it sounded like the wait for a table for two on a regular night was about 30min+. It's nice they have a waiting area as it was extremely cold outside!
The menu had a good variety of items and everything sounded great. After reading through the Yelp reviews, we ordered the deep fried squash for our appetizer to share - good thing there was four of us because it was a huge stack of food. The best thing that made this dish was the sauce, and I would honestly have never known it was squash as it tasted more like yam or sweet potato. This was my favourite dish. 
We ordered the massaman curry as that is a regular fav of mine at most curry places, and the pad gra prow. We asked for both to be foreign spicy but they said that they serve the dishes as mild or medium and could give us extra spice on the side. Good thing we did as I actually found the medium quite spicy. I found the pad gra prow underwhelming visually, and the beef in my curry to be actually pretty tough. I expected the beef to be tender and melt in your mouth quality. However, the flavours for both dishes were strong and tastes authentic, and I was happy my curry did not taste watered down as a lot of Thai places do. 
After being quite satisfied with our meals, we wanted to order dessert. However the staff notified us that they were out of everything..??? Possible on a regular Thursday night? I was quite disappointed. 
Overall, service was good but nothing over the top friendly, and the food was great. I thought it was a bit expensive as the portions were average but the flavours were definitely great. Our food took a long long time to come out (at least 30min) and I'm not sure if this is the norm or they were particularly busy this night. 
I liked that the location was within walking distance from the train stations, and I did not drive so I'm not sure what the parking situation is like. 
Overall I would recommend this place if you like the energetic, bustling atmospheric and good Thai food. Not a good place to having convos with your friends for a long time though as I found it quite distracting and hard to speak loud enough to hear everyone at my table.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Crystal P.,Love the food there. Though lineups was long but moving quite fast. Our server was nice too.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gladys C.,"First off, don't get me wrong with the star rating. I rated based on my taste buds and in general with my experience. 
We arrived around 845pm, had to wait approx. 20mins for our table. There was a line all the wait to the road outside extend from inside the restaurant. We took their offer with bar seating, which we don't mind at all. The restaurant was bigger than I imagined. it was hallway after another hallway leading to another bar area. 
The bartender/waiter was super nice, super friendly and knowledgeable with the menu offers. He was honest with what was good and what was mediocre. 
We ordered based on his recommendations; and it wasn't bad. 
But it certainly didn't satisfy my cravings at that time since they don't offer what I wanted from my mind.
Ordered: laap salad, chicken wings, pad gra prow with beef and crispy pork, and hunglay oxtails. 
Laap salad- was really good, probably would order again if I come here again. Its a good mixture of spicy minced pork, and salad wraps. I would love for them to offer more lettuce wraps though. 
Chicken wings was defo not worth the price. It was only fried chicken wings, nth special, no special sauce or marinated sauce. 
Pad gra prow with beef and crispy pork. The crispy pork was like Chinese style yet it tasted like they baked their pork instead of BBQing. the skin was thick and crispy but not greasy. The minced beef was good, can't go wrong with a signature thai dish. 
I had a sample of the thai milk tea, and I find it too sweet for my likings. So I ordered a beer called cassis he recommended and it tasted like black currants.
I didn't really understand the hype, but I don't crave for it nor will I line up for it again. I've had better thai food, sorry.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kerry W.,"One cloudy afternoon my friend and i decided to hit PAI for a late lunch.  We were put on a waiting list for 15 minutes before being seated.  The restaurant was bustling at 2pm, and i had high hope that this place would be really good since so many people were there.
I ordered Crispy Basa Fillet served with steamed jasmine rice topped with crispy shallots. Served with 2 kinds of sauces.  There were plentiful pieces of fish fillets.  However those fillets were ones you find in the frozen section of grocery stores.  I was expecting real fish.  The 2 dips were good, which somewhat made up for the deep fried frozen fish.  My friend ordered Green Curry with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, green peppers and coconut milk (contains shrimp paste) with beef.  Served with steamed jasmine rice.  The green curry came in a coconut shell which was cute.   The curry itself was delicious with a punch of spiciness, and the beef was tender.  Next time i would definitely order this for myself.
Overall the service was ok.  The server was always around and he was quick to give us the bill.  The atmosphere was lively and jovial.  Nice restaurant to come to for a lazy saturday afternoon.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rae E.,it's hands-down the best Thai restaurant in Toronto. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve R.,"We were in the area doing the tourist thing.  I found this place via Yelp.  Great vibe when you walk in the door.  The place was packed.  Hip music was playing in the background.  We were seated right away.
We ordered the pad gra prow w/crispy pork, pad gra prow w/ shrimp, and green curry w/ chicken; topped it off w/ Pai sangria. Everything was excellent!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nelly W.,"Great Thai food is really hard to come by.    This place is always busy, but the wait is not too bad.  I think we waited about 30 mins, but the food was well worth it.  We got the Squash fritter, Chicken Pad Thai, Massaman Curry and some drinks.  We enjoyed everything
Would come by here again",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tori A.,"I consider myself a Thai food snob and found all Thai restaurants in Toronto mediocre. However, I found Pai and it is the only place I go to for Thai food now. 
Starting with the atmosphere of Pai, it is like any other restaurant in Toronto with all the great decor. The service is always great on every visit and everyone is super friendly. 
I love the Chef Nuit Pad Thai and the Sai Ua Platter (Northern Thai Sausage). My fiance on the other hand is a fan of all the curries, but his absolute favourite is Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. Although, I feel all the dishes at Pai are good and seriously rich in flavour! 
I guess the only downside to Pai is the line up... so definitely try to make a reservation. It seems that on the weekend though for lunch it isn't as busy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kathy L.,"This place used to be my go-to. However, their staff is very greedy, disorganized and RUINED my birthday. 
I approached them a few weeks in advance and booked out the private room for a birthday dinner. They said it was 18 guests min but we could confirm the numbers closer to the date.The reason I chose Pai over the other restaurant options is because their team was so nice and accommodating. What a facade. 
The day of, there was no one to set us up and the whole restaurant was a mess. A few friends couldn't make it last minute and we told one of the waitresses but never got any follow up so I thought it was ok. Food was served extremely slowly - the whole service took over 4 hours!!!
Little did we know, halfway through the service the manager tells us that they've made too much food and are expecting us to pay for the missing seats. Essentially extorting me and being completely unreasonable, as the food was coming out so slowly there was NO WAY it was already prepared. I didn't want to make a scene at my party, but essentially I got scammed $500 for some ""extra prepared food"" costs....wtf
From being a regular to never coming back again - their management staff completely ruined my night. I will never recommend this place to anyone ever again. Horrible experience that could have completely been avoided if they were a better run and organized restaurant. Extremely disappointed.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Spurthi A.,"This is a pretty good Thai restaurant. For a Saturday night the wait was only 30 minutes for a party of 4, which wasn't bad at all. The restaurant was packed. The fish dish was fried very well. It didn't hold a lot of oil. The Khao Soi and green curry were also good. Both had good flavors. 
This is a pretty up beat atmosphere. Service is quick and food tastes fresh. 
What's interesting is during your wait you can order drinks and appetizers while you're waiting and they will put it on your tab for when you get to your table. Even though the wait wasn't too long, it's a great idea!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kimmese L.,"I went here so many times. I love the food and service, but not today. I came here at lunchtime, so I didn't aware that the menu is going to be different than dinner. So I asked the server why it's different than last time i came, but then she just said ""Just for dinner"" and glance at us and left. I was so shock by her attitude! I didn't expected to experience something like this at Pai. Disappointed.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tari D.,"For our 1st meal in Toronto, it was Exceptional! We had the Spring Rolls...Amazing!
King Oyster Mushroom w/ Black rice... Amazing!
Thai Shrimp Fried Rice... Amazing!!!
I Love the fact of them having Vegan Options",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Charles C.,"Not always easy to get a table - Torontonians are in the know now of the best Thai in the city. My lady and I visited northern Thailand in 2012 and fell in love with the cuisine. Much different than the southern classics - green/red curry, pad Thai etc - the northern food was rich, complex and comforting. In the town of Pai, we relaxed by the river, ate amazing food and motorcycled around the countryside. The night market there was our favourite in the country. The Pai locals were so welcoming - I recall ending up partying at a local wedding with a family we happened to meet - and the owners of Pai (Toronto) brought that familiar humble, generous culture across the pond. 
If you want a short review, here goes: The food is Spectacular.  
We have been to Pai (the restaurant) twice now. Once as a couple - and again as a group of 8. The Thai iced tea - orange in colour - with condensed milk - brought me back to the streets of Chiang mai. The Holy Basil they cooked the Pad Gra Pow with is imported from Thailand. I hope to grow some this summer at home. Make sure to try the crispy pork version of this - it was next level awesome. 
The sai ua sausage - amazing flavours and glad to see the lemongrass doesn't overpower everything - these guys know what they're doing. 
The khao soi was so filling but perfect. Authentic creamy texture with a great spice mix. Classic Thai comfort food with some great crunch. Same can be said for the massaman - perfect for a winters night - but the potato and beef might be too much for a summer meal. Laap salad is a must try for anyone who misses the flavourful sticky rice of northern Thailand. As a group - we started with the Grabong - which was great to share. 
Get down here - and wait an hour if there are no tables. Maybe you'll see Michael fassbender. Or the girl from step up (people are flocking from far and wide to sample this amazing food) Or maybe I'll be there! But the food and ambience will Captivate. Enormous cavern of a restaurant - it just keeps going! So tables come up quick. Enjoy :) KAP",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Debbie P.,"Thai Iced tea ($5.50)
This was quite expensive, but I guess it can be justified since it's a big glass. The thing is, it was way to sweet and with it being so sweet it was difficult to finish it all. I know Thai iced teas are naturally really sweet, but this was just a bit too much for my liking.
Thai Chicken Wings ($5.50)
Came with 3 large wings - this was tasty. I really liked it. They were actually large wings which I liked, well marinated and went well with the sweet and spicy dipping sauce.
Pad Thai with Pork ($15.50)
I suppose pork wasn't the best meat to go with pad thai, but we ordered chicken wings and khao soi with beef so figured we would ask for a different type of meat. The pork meat is not that great, meat was slightly dry. You can choose your level of spiciness which we chose mild. You can rarely taste any spice in mild, if you like more of a kick i would go for the Medium. I liked the flavor of the pad thai. Definitely my favorite dish for the night.
Khao Soi with Beef ($15.50)
This was slightly disappointing. I don't know why but at all the Thai places I go and order Khao Soi, there is always so little noodles inside. Same case here. There was a decent amount of beef but the beef meat were slightly tough, not as tender as I'd hope it to be. The Khao soi flavor was slightly bland, was expecting more of a stronger taste.
Honestly, I think this place is over-hyped. Thank god I came here early, just before 6pm and avoided a line. The food is good but definitely not worth the wait - I've had better Thai food elsewhere. It's funny because the waitress was telling us the owner of Pai is the same owner as Suko thai and other top thai restaurants in Toronto. My experience didn't feel that way though.
Seems like they update their menu pretty often. Noticed they increased some of their food items by $0.50 in 6 months...",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Merhawi G.,"POSITIVES:
Amazing food.
Great service.
Exciting and energetic environment.
NEGATIVES:
The mf line is always so fucking long... but the wait isn't horrible. Better if you go in a group greater than 3 imo.
All in all the process adds to the experience which is pretty cool. ENJOY!
GET THE CHEF NUIT PAD THAI!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nikita G.,"I've tried both Pai and Khao San Road numerous times, and while I want to give Pai 4 stars I've just always liked my experiences at Khao San Road. Here's a breakdown of why:
Food: Hands down, the pad thai at Khao San Road is more flavorful and consistently yummy. The one at Pai was a little more mushy (overcooked noodles?), and last time my friend received a clump of noodles all stuck together as if it had been sitting out for way too long. Totally not impressed by the noodle dish that's sold for $17. Moving on from that - the green curry at Pai will always win in my heart. It tastes authentic and is served in a coconut shell - ask for spicy if you're into that because the baseline for this dish is very mild/medium! I've heard that the Khao soi is also really good at Pai, but I've only had it at Khao San Road so can't comment. 
Drinks: Pai has a more extensive alcoholic drinks menu, and during the Raptors post-season playoffs games they even had Raptors themed cocktails. Not sure if that's still a thing now that we lost again. HOWEVER, the Thai iced tea at Khao San Road is much yummier and creamier. The one at Pai is filled with ice to the point where it feels like you're drinking a slushie. Yuck. 
Service: ok, this is arguably the most important part of dining out (besides the food). My experiences at Pai have always varied... from good to sub-par. Last time it took 45 minutes for my food to arrive on a Thursday, and all the restaurant did to compensate was give us ONE dessert to share amongst FOUR adults. Why even bother to attempt to act like you're compensating at that point? 
Pai, there was a time when I really loved you but now Khao San Road just really has my heart. The only reason I'd come back to you is for your green curry!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea W.,"I came here because it's one of the top-rated Thai spots in Toronto, and I came early to avoid the wait. I came just a bit after opening for lunch, and I was immediately seated. The market spot was really cool, a unique concept where people can get to-go quickly or just sit there and eat after ordering food to-go. I got an actual table to order food, and I wanted Thai tea but was concerned about it being too sweet. My waitress asked if I wanted to try it, so I did and it was too sweet. I ended up ordering the khao soi with rice noodles and without the crispy noodles. I then waited for almost twenty minutes for my food, after the other tables around me already got there food. The rice noodles were really chewy, and the soup was really flavorful. The shrimp was fresh and there were five of them which I enjoyed. The noodles were boring though, as there were just noodles, five shrimp, and soup. Portions were good but it was pricey at around $20 (CAD) post-tax. Service was slow, wasn't a fan, but the ambiance was pleasant.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie P.,"It's insanely busy every day of the week! You'll likely be waiting for a table any time of day, but the food is worth it.
Food is really tasty, good for sharing and trying a few different dishes.  I would recommend 3 dishes for 2 people to share.  Great selection of beers and not your typical Thai dishes, one of the best Thai places I've been to in the city",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Khoi N.,"Stopped by here with some family on a busy Saturday. The place was completely packed, but we were seated quickly. We ordered the $5 sake bombs, Thai chicken wings, shrimp gaeng panang curry, pad gra prow, larb salad, Thai ice teas and the khao pad thamada. The dishes here are authentic, seasoned well and definitely reminded me of Bangkok street food. Between the 4 of us we devoured the food. There was literally nothing left. The wings had a great tangy tamarind sauce. Definitely get it if you like wings they come in 3s. The curry was mild, but had a rich creamy texture. The thamada was delicious with the minced meat and the fried egg was perfect. Prices here are really reasonable and the staff here is great with their service. There were always servers ready to assist. Highly recommend this spot as it provides authentic Thai cuisine without breaking the bank. They have great high chair seating and also limited traditional seating as well. Located in the heart of Toronto this place has plenty of street parking. The menu is small, but they have all types of dishes for vegetarians to meat lovers. Recommend booking in advance and making reservations as the place can get busy at anytime.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David I.,"I went to dinner here for my girlfriends birthday. As usual, the food was spectacular. We ordered the grabong, green curry, and pad Thai, all of which were superb. The atmosphere was very comfortable, yet visually stimulating as well. The service was fantastic and checked on us frequently. Definitely the go-to place for Thai food in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,K H.,"The atmosphere here is quite good. Although the music gets a bit bassy as if there are overly cranked up subwoofers in the ceiling somewhere. The service was incredibly friendly though it looks when things get busy, it may become difficult to contact personnel. 
We ordered Kung Tawt garlic shrimp and small order of soup to start, both of these dishes were beyond expectations. A simple fried shrimp dish executed well with a nice tangy sauce was a great way to get things started. Then, the tom yam soup was probably one the best I've had-- herbalicious lemongrass, green onion and fresh tomatoes heaped into a shrimp shell based broth with just a touch of fish sauce. It was tart enough without seeming artificial and spicy enough to keep it interesting through the entire bowl. 
The entrees were simply put: not particularly well executed. My wife had the khao soi curry noodles as raved about by other yelpers. The dish seemed like a dish with potential that got drowned out in a sea of coconut milk. No subtleties in the underlying curry could shine through. The pieces of beef were ok but they were definitely sitting in some type of stewing vat given the meat texture variation from dry and stringy to moist and succulent across the different pieces. Perhaps, the dish is a bit dumbed down for the masses, perhaps the proportion between curry mixture, broth and coconut milk got messed up, either way palette alignment was a bit off for us on this one. 
My entree was the pad gra prow. Again, this dish also didn't measure up. It was as if someone laid a bed of rice and stir fried some ground meat with basil and then had to wait 15 minutes for a fried egg. This dish given its temperature should not have been served. Instead, they did serve this dish with a cold steel container of sauce; enough steel to chill the dish further but not really enough sauce to use to flavor the dish. It reminded me of cold crumbled hamburger on pseudo warm rice. No hint of culinary excellence in this dish and probably lacked the potential of the noodle dish. I've had so many better versions of this dish but I was hungry so I did eat it.
The meal was somewhat memorable given the energy of the place. But, things were definitely a bit off. I'd give the shrimp a 4 and the soup a 5. I'd give each of the entrees a 1. It really begs the question, were the dishes supposed to be that way?",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha S.,"I was in Toronto for business and was really craving Thai food and this place was conveniently located to my hotel. Given, it was a Friday night at 6pm, this restaurant was PACKED. Good thing I was only eating by myself so the bartender hooked me up with a seat. I ordered the Chicken Wings for starters, delicious sauce. And then for my main course I ordered the Green Coconut Curry with Chicken. The presentation for the Curry was so BEAUTIFUL. It came in an actual coconut and served with rice on the side. Very Delicious.
The ambiance of this restaurant alone is amazing. Also, food is great! 5/5 would recommend if you're in the Toronto Area.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily C.,"Best pad Thai in town, came around 3-4 pm at an off hour for lunch and it was still packed! Would recommend the masang curry, pad Thai with chicken was delicious as well. One of the best Thai places I've been to, will have to come back to Toronto just to taste this again!",5

love pai  and it is good taste 
Enjoy the meal and thanks pai during this special period",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rosa S.,"I like that their food has both authenticity, yet at the same time, creativity. Everything very delicious there. I like that you can customize spice levels as well. The atmosphere is very fun, and inviting, definitely great if you're going out with friends. 
It is quite loud though, not a huge restaurant. 
Service is great too. Staff seem like they enjoy working there. 
Can be challenging to get a reservation.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jervy L.,"Hands down favourite Thai restaurant. Used to drive hours just to go here. Khao Soi, pad thai and the fritters are my regular orders.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roland H.,"Pai is very good. It is brought to you by the people that brought you Sabai Sabai (which is one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto). I would recommend going with a few friends. The menu at Pai is best enjoyed family style. 
The Chef Nuit Pad Thai is a signature dish and is delicious. It taste homemade. On this occasion, I paired it with a Thai milk tea which I would recommend.
The price is slightly higher than other Thai places but it is fair for the quality you are getting.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Synthia W.,"As usual, this place is very tasty, but very busy. 
We came on a Thursday night around 5:30pm. We waited about 15 minutes to grab a buzzer, waited for about 15 minutes for a table that we shared in the party room section and waited even longer for our food - close to 30 minutes! 
The Thai iced tea we ordered came fairly quickly. Tasted good but nothing overly special. Would have liked it more if they used ice cubes instead of shaved ice.
I ordered the Penang beef curry. You could choose the spice level to your liking and the dish comes with a bowl of rice on the side. It's a good portion if you're not extremely hungry. The dish was very flavourful as expected. One of my go to favourites. 
My boyfriend ordered the pad gra prow. It's not a huge portion especially if you're hungry. He enjoyed it but not the best he's had.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mag L.,"Came to this place for dinner. We sat at the ""patio"", which is basically the street. Was kinda noisy as expected in Toronto. Its a trendy place with lots of young ppl 
The curry was awesome,  but the papaya salad for $15 ish was a little of a miss and I had better before.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ian C.,"I've never had any Thai food before coming to this place and after trying Pai out, it's like a whole new world has opened up for me. This place was pretty good. Had the Pad Gra Prow, which was egg on top of beef and rice and it was pretty good. 
Pai had a decent wait time, seems like a popular place to be and with good reason. 
The environment was awesome. The music they played was old school hip hop. And the servers was pretty nice too 
One of the better places that I've been too.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sean W.,"I came here for lunch while visiting Toronto. Pai sells some classic Thai dishes but also has a focus on Northern style Thai food. Prices are on the higher end for average to meager portions; flavor was on point though. Would come back to try more Northern style dishes.
The interior was decorated fairly randomly; it feels like you're in a pirate ship, there are cut outs of NBA players, and some paintings. Service was very friendly.
Ordered:
Pad Gra Prow - ground Pork with white jasmine rice and topped with a thai style fried egg. Comes with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime). Was really flavorful, but the portions were fairly light. At the price, I wish it was more substantial.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wendy W.,Food is good and the place is nice. Service also is good but this place is packed! I would say although the food is good but it is a bit expensive for the portion. I ordered a chicken pad thai and gaeng masaman with braised beef. Pad Thai is a bit on the sweet side and not enough peanut for me. The gaeng masaman braised beef has good curry but the beef need to be more tender. Overall it's good place to eat and make sure to come early otherwise you will need to line up for roughly 30mins for 2 people if you come at 7pm. Also the food take a bit time to come. Although food portion isn't big but it's filling enough since it's either come with rice or noodle. Also they don't take same day reservation,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Violet X.,"This is absolutely my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. Or I should say my favourite restaurant of all time !! 
Nice service. 
AMAZING authentic Thai food 
I also love the vibes in the restaurant!
Strongly recommend everything with curry! And the desserts are also worth a try! (Mango sticky rice & coconut ice cream)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tracy L.,"love the food, everything is very flavorful and at a good price; however i had a problem with the wait time and is hard to make a reservation. 
You really need to make a reservation a month advance if your planning for  a group gathering or birthday. The staff are nice but get really busy at the night time, if your just in town and want to try thai food come during lunch time , you would experience the thai food the best at lunch time.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zachary C.,"A tiny bit pricey (but not enough to drop a star), but definitely worth it for the quality of food, service , atmosphere and drinks.
It was super busy when we arrived, but the hostess advised only a 20 minute wait, which was more like 5 anyway!
We had two DeMartinis, Pai's limey and tart version of the gin classic, with a kaffir lime leaf for an added hipster vibe. They were super refreshing and a great start to the meal. They did have an interesting array of cocktails, around $10 CAD each.
The appetiser selection was so broad. We were tempted to just order from this section but the mains were also incredible. We got Moo Ping (typical Thai street food dish of grilled pork skewers) which was succulent and delicious. This went perfectly with the Som Tum (spicy green papaya salad) with the sweet, salty and spicy combinations.
It was hard to choose the mains. There were a lot of dishes that reminded me of my trip to Thailand but we ended up settling with some great choices: one I've had before and a new dish entirely. Pad Ga Pow (spicy chicken with Hoyle basil, Thai fried egg and rice) and Gaeng Masaman (peanut and tamarind based curry with rice). Both of these dishes were exceptional, with hugely different flavours which gave us a well rounded dining experience.
We did eat a bit too much that we didn't have any space for dessert. They did have mango sticky rice (my favourite!) I honestly couldn't eat another mouthful.
I can't wait to come back to Toronto just to visit Pai again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Connie L.,"We waited in line for 20 mins on a Wednesday night but I won't complain because this is one of the busiest restaurant in Toronto as far as I know.
I ordered the so-called legendary Khao Soi and sadly I didn't like it very much.
The dish was very sweet and I got sick of it after 2 bites.
What I do liked very much was the appetizer squash fritters. The potion was generous and it taste amazing. My boyfriend enjoyed his pai thai as well.
So far I ain't all cuckoo about this place but I do like to give it another shot one-day to figure out of why this is one of the most popular restaurant in TO.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elaine G.,"The Pad Thai here is best I've ever had. This is a basic staple in all thai restaurants I have been to. If you don't know what to get, you can't go wrong with this. We also ordered a special Khao Soi Braised Beef. It was good, the soup was not hot when it reached our table, but the overall flavor was still decent. I probably would not order this again, personal taste, because I thought the flavor of this curry had a higher emphasis on a turmeric and coconut flavor. 
As a note, both of these dishes were ordered mild! Boyfriend and I felt this this was a bit spicy! Boyfriend cannot eat spicy food (as he thinks chicken from Chipotle is spicy). Nice comparison for those who are wondering what kind of spice level to get. 
Only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 was because the soup was not hot when it reached our table and it was hard to flag down waiters to help get the check or to-go boxes.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bharti S.,"The best place with gud food excellent service. I would have rated it more than 5 star if thr was option to select ! Amazing ambience with lots of noise not bothering you at all .
All that we ordered right frm the noodles to the shrimp curry and chicken thai curry were excellent .
I really dont recollect the exact names of the dish ordered but all were worth . Would visit again soon",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hana L.,"I absolutely love Pai!! 
I am not a huge fan of Thai food but Pai has got me hooked and I find myself craving it! The way they season everything is just phenomenal. I recommend everything on the menu, its so delicious. Very reasonable on the price too.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aarthika U.,"Slightly overrated to be honest. 
The chicken satay and garlic shrimp were amazing. The chicken was very soft and shrimp was extremely flavourful and crispy. 
But the main course of pad gra prow was disappointing. My friend didn't think her chicken pad thai was anything special either.  On my rice dish the spinach felt stringy and overcooked and didnt taste that good. The rice was very overcooked too.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica S.,"This place did not disappoint! Their mushroom spring rolls are amazing and I ordered their green curry with tofu and veg. Highly recommend their pad thai also! 
Great quality and truly a wonderful meal!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James C.,Awesome small restaurant find in near Mccaul and Baldwin. Stumbled on this place via Yelp. We had the fried chicken and a few other dishes. The curries are pretty spicy. They have a lot of great plates for sharing. be careful with some of their hot sauces as they are quite spicy. I recommend their chicken leg.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lucille S.,"PAI is one of my fave place for Khao Soi!! 
My friend and I came for girls-night dinner on a Thursday. We started with their PAI sangria and switched to merlot with our dinner. My friend ordered the pad Thai (foreigner spicy level) and I got the Khao soi.
The taste was 5 star, but the portions have decreased since I last came in. Their service is also good, but felt a little rushed after they saw us finish our meal. 
Will I go back? Yes, because of Khao soi",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fiona L.,"I L O V E P A I ! ! !
This is easily my favourite thai place, and favourite restaurant in Toronto, for that matter. 
I have been here several times and it has not disappointed each time. I've tried the Khao Soi, Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup, and Gang Kiaw Wan (in a coconut). I can say that the portions are enough for me (I don't eat that much) to be full and not finish all the rice or noodles. Wait time to get a table can be super long and the service is not amazing, but the food is so good it keeps me coming back. 
I would recommend to come around 5-6ish on a weekday if you don't want to wait. 
This is a good place to come with friends, family, partner, coworkers, even alone really!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lan P.,"I haven't had anything here I didn't like, but my favorites are Tom yum shrimp and the green curry with fish. 
The tom yum shrimp are fried perfectly. It'll tear-up the roof of your mouth, but it'll be worth it. The green curry...you'll want to eat/drink every crumb and drop of it. I'm not even the biggest green curry fan, but this dish is unbelievably good.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Faiza K.,"I've been lusting after this place for months and lucky enough today was my chance to try it out.  I went for lunch with a friend and there was a small wait.  This place is in the Financial District so I think it's aiming to grab the suits and serve up quick lunches - quick turnover equals more money.  Kinda like an upscale-ish hole in the wall.  
It's a decent size but they pack in the tables so you feel like you are sitting in your neighbour's lap (hopefully they are good looking), but it lends to the good vibes in here. 
The drinks are unique and interesting but slightly pricey for what you get, but I guess the price is ok for the area.
Originally we were told a 20 min wait but it ended up being only about 6-7 min wait and we were able to order drinks at the bar.  We both had the beef curry (massaman curry).  I chose medium spicy but honestly I didn't find it that spicy - a nice little hint of heat with a soft hint of sweetness.  It was delicious. The food comes quickly so if you are on your lunch you should be good to eat and run.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edna F V.,"Omg! What a joint!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The coconut  curry (chicken) was un-fucking believable!!!
The best Thai food I've ever had in my life!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jasmine H.,"Pai is definitely one of the best places to get Thai food in Toronto. The restaurant's food is consistently good, and comes out quite quickly. The servers are also knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu, and friendly to answer any questions.
I highly recommend the squash fritters, which are deep-fried clumps of shredded squash, as well as the Khao Soi, which is a thick curry noodle soup. For drink, I suggest trying the Thai Iced Tea - it's creamy and bright orange, and has a strong sweet taste. 
The only downside is that this restaurant is quite popular, so there always tends to be a line, especially on weekends. It also tends to get loud in the restaurant later in the evening!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria K.,"HEART EYES ABOUT THIS THAI RESTAURANT. I legit loved every dish we ordered and I will be coming back to try everything else they have to offer. The ambience is very upbeat and lively, and the interior gives off an exotic vibe - almost makes it seem like I've stepped into Thailand for a bit. 
We ordered a few dishes to share including the chicken pad Thai, Panang beef curry, and Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. Just as a side note - the spice levels on curry dishes cannot be adjusted (all the curry comes mild) Anyways, each dish was so flavourful and delicious. We got the foreigner level of spice for the chicken pad Thai but it was pretty spicy so take caution! 
For dessert we ordered the mango sticky rice which is a specialty not included on the menu. Unfortunately, our mango sticky rice only came with one slice of mango, although in previous photos I've seen on Yelp had two slices. Either way, it was amazing - but an acquired taste for those who might find it odd to be eating mango with rice. The Thai iced tea is also a great addition to the meal! Despite being a bit too sweet and quite pricey for its size, it definitely completes the experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carolyn T.,"Great Yelp find! As of the time of my trip to Toronto, Pai had 1646 Yelp reviews and was the top reviewed and rated place in Toronto. (I always use the Yelp app to filter based on number of reviews, pro tip.) I read about the crazy wait times, so we decided to eat at 4 PM. Eating at an off time without a reservation was definitely the way to go. Even when eating at such a random time, there was actually still a short wait for a table! 
There are two different places you can choose to eat. There is the main dining area and then there is the newer cafe area in the back of the restaurant. As far as I'm aware, the menu is the same in both areas. We sat in the newer cafe area. I ordered the pad thai and my now-husband ordered the pad gra prow. He absolutely loved the soft boiled egg on top dripping deliciously over his dish. The pad thai was definitely solid. Fresh. Big portion. And I liked it so much I ate the whole thing in one sitting! 
My only complaint is that it's a little cramped in there. Because this place is so popular, they really try to cram in as many tables and chairs as possible. I couldn't comfortably keep my coat draped on the back of my chair because it was right up against the wall, and my purse only just barely fit on the floor. As people walked by, I kept having to readjust the purse so it wasn't getting in the way. I can see they are addressing the space issue by trying to expand. I think it would be great for them open another location!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arlene S.,"One of the best parts of traveling is trying different food and restaurants. Even better when yelp help you discover a gem like This!
We went on a Sunday afternoon, be prepared to wait or make reservations in advance. There was a line just to get to the host and jot down you name and how many in your party. They have a market area that does not have an alcohol license but you my get seated faster. We didn't mind not drinking alcohol so went that route, we were seated there within 5 minutes. 
It was a rainy chilly day so I went with hot Jasmine Tea. It came in a cute pot with enough for several servings. For dinner I got the Gaeng Hunglay with Oxtail. I honestly had no idea what it was and was hesitant because I am not a fan of sweet and sour but I LOVE oxtail. When ever I see it on a menu I tend to choose it. I am glad I did! This has been one of my favorite dishes at a restaurant. The curry had just the right amount of heat, nice kick of flavor but did not have you sniffling. Mixing the rice in with the oxtail and sauce was a perfect balance of flavors. Meal left me full and happy!
I would definitely come back here if I ever visit Toronto again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alfred D.,"This one is a bit overdue, but to start my string of reviews will be Pai. It is regarded as the best place to get Thai food in Downtown Toronto. Honestly, I'm not that big of Thai food since my spice tolerance is non existent haha. So to start, the restaurant doesn't look as extravagant or fancy but it still gives a very welcoming atmosphere and ambiance. Besides, the food is really where it's at! Depending on the day you go it does get really busy, so be prepared to wait a little bit if you don't have a reservation. Once seated, me and my friends opted for the spring rolls as a starter. Deep fried, vegetarian spring rolls. Pretty good filling plus the sweet and sour sauce was very tasty. For my main, I got the beef Pad Gra Prow - this can come in pork, chicken, beef or tofu. I got the beef (no spice of course) and it was seasoned very well and was packed with so much flavour. The fried egg really complimented the dish well. My friends got the pad thai and curry. Unfortunately they both like their dishes spicy so I didn't want to risk it haha. To sum it all, it's a great spot to have lunch or dinner! Will definitely be back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Audrey W.,"Great food, lived up to it's hype.
Enjoyed dining in at Pai with my family of 4, 2 adults and 2 tweens, during a brief moment in lock down where indoor dining was allowed, pre-omicron.
The starters were fine, but nothing to write home about, had shrimp chips, chicken wings and spring rolls.
The mains will keep me coming back again and again. The Khao Soi tasted like the real deal, the broth was flavourful the noodles perfect and the beef tender. Highly recommend
The Pad Gra Prow was amazing. Perfect comfort food with all the flavours of south east Asia. Also recommend
Also had the chicken green curry, great presentation and the pad see ew, both lovely but didn't blow my mind as the Khao Soi and Pad Gra Prow did.
Ambience was great, casual, comfortable. Service was lovely. Just a great dining experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cindy W.,"After coming back a couple times over the years, the quality of food hasn't changed - which is quite impressive and why I feel like I need to update my review. The line is still out the door, but moves pretty quick. 
Most notable dish is the green curry served in a coconut. 
The appetizers should not to be passed over either!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brandon A.,"In town with a large group, so I had to check out the best thai place in the Toronto area. After finding this spot, I had to bring my friends here and try it. We had a reservation and did not have to wait in the very long line to even put your name down on a Friday night. 
When our table was getting ready, someone overheard it was one of our friend's bachelor parties, and gave us a complimentary drink. We were seated shortly thereafter, and it was then that I realized that this was probably the best Thai I had ever had in my life. The food was so good, and while I got the penang curry with chicken, I tried the pad thai (also delicious, and something I do not normally like). While our group of 12 was loud, the whole restaurant was popping and a lively place. If we did not want to try other places in Toronto, we probably would've come back for breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert.
Also great drinks, if you're looking for more than a bite.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erica D.,"For me, Pai had been one of those restaurants that I've always heard good things about, but had never gotten around to trying. You know, the one somewhere in the middle of your restaurant wish list that you keep passing over for ol' reliables and trendy gimmicks... Well, I finally quit procrastinating and checked out the place. 
It did not disappoint. 
Even just from an organizational standpoint, Pai was impressive. Huge space packed to the max, and somehow the food came out super fast and perfectly correct. The server was friendly and patient - not frazzled in the least - and they offered multiple vegan options. Incredible. 
Now for the food itself... everything was a total party in the mouth. The panang curry was probably my favourite dish of the night. I could have easily bathed in that sauce. The Pad Thai was probably my least favourite dish, but it was still a solid Pad Thai (and my friends loved it, so you might also think I'm crazy for saying that). The papaya salad was definitely the dark horse. I wasn't super keen on ordering it, but I'm very glad we did. Tangy, refreshing, and a lovely hit of spice. 
The prices are slightly higher than your average Thai place, but nothing crazy. Pretty sure every dish was still under $20. Plus they had some decent sounding drink specials ($5 tequila on Friday... drink responsibly!). All in all, a fantastic experience that completely lives up to the hype.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mugendd P.,"3.5/5
Looking for a place DT for Friday night dinner went to Yelp for some  help and Pai caught my attention with its highly recommend reviews. Got there just before 6 and was seated but shortly after the queue started to grow. Service was prompt and our server was nice and  gave her reco for the popular items we skipped the pad Thai and went for Khao soi and Pad gra prow that was her top picks khao sou came first and was very tasty just as I expected from other khao soi I have noodle was portion seemed small for the price and it was not hot enough border line warm at best the pad gra prow was good love the jasmine rice but again it cold have been hotter in temp. All in all good place with a good vibe and recommend",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Meryl J.,"The wait for 2 on a Sunday night was about 10 minutes. They are pretty strict about their closing time so keep that in mind! The restaurant is huge! So many rooms and seating options. The bathroom was clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered a spicy pad Thai. It was not spicy and was very tamarind forward. The proteins (chicken, shrimp and egg) were all cooked perfectly. It was a generous portion size. We would definitely want to come back to try more of their menu - just wasn't blown away by the pad thai.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ritu D.,"I have been past this location hundreds of times and wasn't aware of it. My friends and I went for lunch and were thrilled at our experience. Two of us required vegan and gluten free meals and the other two did not. The menu clearly indicated which items could be done vegan and gluten free and we were able to choose our spice level.
Two had the red curry dish with tofu and loved it. The other two had the pad Thai, one chicken and mine was with tofu and medium spice. Spice level was perfect and tolerable. The meal was so delicious. I was full after eating half of it and should have had the rest packed, but it was so tasty so I finished it. My friend ordered the coconut sorbet (vegan) topped with pralines, toasted coconut, tapioca and corn something. It was outstanding. I was too full to enjoy it so I will go back just for that. I had coconut water with my meal, which was very flavourful but expensive at $6 per glass. The pad Thai was $13.50 but it was a big portion.
It is casual inside with tall and short wood tables and a bar. I'm definitely going back since it is walking distance to Princess of Wales, Royal Alex, Tiff Bell Lightbox and Roy Thompson Hall. They have a sister restaurant close by called Kiin which the server said is a little more upscale.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aman B.,The food was really great and they followed instructions when I asked them something specific online. Thank you!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bonnie W.,"Our to go meal is their chef nuit pad Thai with chicken, gaeng massaman curry with beef and Thai ice tea!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jade D.,"Pai was the dinner destination I hoped to find as I explored what makes Toronto the fun, international, popping city it is.  A local friend I was visiting brought me to this popping and delicious Tai restaurant for dinner,  and I see why she wanted to show it off! 
From their menu, I saw a lot of rice options, but I was craving noodles; so I reluctantly ordered the vegetable/tofu Pad Thai, despite usually finding this dish less exciting than other Thai dishes. One bite in, and I was so thankful that I went with my gut. 
The Pad Thai was possibly the best I've had, I think partially due to the peanut sauce and it being perfectly spiced. I got the second to the highest level--I'd recommend this level to others who have a pretty high spice tolerance but nothing to prove. 
The vibe was really cool/hip, but not intimidating. Again, what you look for when visiting such a big and eclectic city like toronto. I will say that for a Sunday night it was very busy, and the system for getting seated was different than what I was used to--instead of putting your name in, you line up and the hosts seat your party as tables become available. Despite being packed the line moved pretty quickly, and I don't think we stayed in line longer than 20 minutes. Eventually we were seated at the bar but it was a cool ambiance and the bartenders were great at checking on us even as things were busy.
Great experience and, even know there are more amazing options I've yet to discover, I'd definitely go back if I returned to Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anthony W.,"Pai is one of the best Thai places in Toronto! Our go-to orders are their pad thai, squash fritters (MUST order) and their spring rolls. We also love getting their Thai iced tea! The squash fritters are a huge appetizer so you definitely need a couple of people with you to share it with.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,George L.,"The prices are a little steep, but the hype is real. We came for lunch at 12:30pm on a Saturday with no reservation and luckily didn't have to wait at all, even as a group of 8. We must have come at a perfect time window because all the vacant tables were filled 10 minutes after we were seated, so I recommend making a reservation!
The restaurant interior was dimly lit and cozy, and the service was friendly and competent. I shared the ~CA$6 Thai Chicken Wings with two others in the group, which were quite small but on point with that classic Thai-style chicken flavor. I'd only recommend this appetizer to someone who REALLY likes chicken wings though.
For my entree, I ordered a ~CA$16 Pad Gra Pow, which consisted of holy basil stir fried with a choice of meat (ground pork), steamed jasmine rice, a thai-styled fried egg on top, and nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili, and lime) on the side. I wished the portion size had been at least 25% bigger, especially given its high price. HOWEVER, THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST FLAVORFUL AND SAVORY MEALS I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME. I wolfed down the meal in record time, and you could tell that the food at Pai Thai was good overall because our table grew quiet when all of it came; you could only hear chewing and slurping noises at that point.
I enjoyed my experience at Pai Thai and would be down to come back again! If you've never been here and are visiting Toronto, I highly recommend trying this place out. By the way, the Toronto Aquarium is a 15-minute walk from here, so you could factor that into your itinerary. Bon Appétit!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tiffany J.,"I was visiting Toronto for four nights, and this place was so good I came here for two of them! 
My friend recommended this place to me so I came here with some other friends. I ordered the Khao Soi with chicken breast. My friends were both vegetarian so they got vegan dishes, and when I got my Khao Soi it was the vegan version with tofu, broccoli, and cauliflower. It was still very delicious, the broth is very flavorful, but after I realized after a few bites, they swapped the dish for me. The chicken portion looked smaller but was still a lot of food. I got the chicken wings and pad Thai with chicken on my second night, and it was very good. The chicken wings were a little too salty for me but that pad Thai was on point!!!! And a huge portion too, I ate a quarter of it if that! 
The mango sticky rice is also delicious!! It's a small portion but very tasty.
It looks like they get super busy during regular hours!! But they have a waiting area and a bar. I'd love to try their drinks next time- they sounded quite yummy!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Herman L.,"This is a very busy place right around the entertainment district in a smaller road/street - very popular among the business folks but also even at night. The one downside I would say if you go in a group of 5 or 6, they'll charge 18% service charge or it was 20% I don't remember but it was something ridiculously high. For a place like this where it is too busy to even get service, it's hard to justify such an automatic tipping percent. Understandably that is because they are busy but doesn't justify for that type of treatment.
Irrespective of that, the food is good. I've been here a couple of times but after awhile it does get kinda boring simply because you eat the same type of similar food - relatively wet, saucy, and it really only works out if you want something saucy to eat from.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wynee B.,"Wow, where do I start. I only had the Khao Soi and the garlic shrimp so I can only speak on those two. 
The Khao Soi deserves a 15 out of 10 star rating. The soup is creamy, mildy spicy (just enough for that kick), melt in your mouth beef, and not too thin or too thick noodles that will have you craving more. 
The garlic shrimp was crunchy, flavorable, and delicious!
If you're in toronto, this is a must try place but be prepared to WAIT.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zonia M.,"I happened to pass by this spot and was intrigued by the crowd and busyness of the place. I figured ""why not"", and requested a seat for one. I was a little nervous since I just heard the hostess tell the group before me that the wait was 45 min-1 hour, and it was only 1.5 hours before closing. Luckily flying solo has its perks, as I was seated immediately at the bar. 
The place was super busy and the bartenders were always busy scrambling around making drinks and serving food, but they made sure to stay attentive. The lady I had was nice and always made sure she got to everyone at the bar. 
I ordered the Sai Ua Platter, Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken and a sangria. Everything was delicious! I was so full I could barely finish. I asked for mild on the spice level but def should've opted for a level higher. The sausage came with sticky rice and it was such a nice presentation. They gave a nice helping of the pad Thai and everything was perfect.
I see why the place is so popular and would def come again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aisha C.,Amazing Thai food. I haven't had anything bad on the menu and I've tried most of it. Now on kitchen hub and the quality is just as good. (The downtown location can be quite busy at prime times),4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ayesha G.,"Yummmmmmmy best Thai food in all of Toronto!!!!!!! 
Tonight, The food was delicious including the pad Thai! We also got the green curry inside the coconut which was a delight!! The veggie spring rolls were good too. Pad Thai was good but not the best hat I've ever eaten. I think their pad Thai has been better in the past.
My husband got the ginger beer which he really
Enjoyed but i felt it had too spicy of a kick that hurts the throat.
I got the fresh pineapple shake which was delicious and very refreshing. 
So the line to get in the restaurant seemed really really long and we waited outside but as soon as we got to the front we were seated immediately. The reservations and waiting in line are the biggest drawback of this place. The line seems to move faster than you can imagine but it can sometimes still be quite a long wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jocelyn C.,"This place is awesome! A great gem in the city that serves delicious Thai food. 
Their papaya salad and their Khao Soi are my go-tos. So delicious. 
Atmosphere and ambiance is relaxed and fun--great to go to with coworkers or friends. They have a really cool bar area too at the back of the restaurant. Highly recommended for good Thai food in the city.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dorna R.,"If you are thinking about going to this place on a weekend, reserve a table right now!! This place is almost always booked especially in Winter. There is usually a long line-up in front of it. Do yourself a favour and avoid the line up in the cold weather and book it in advance.
We reserved a table for two 3 weeks in advance. The place looks like you have walked into a store in Thailand! The decorations, old tables and candles all add to the coziness of the place. Service is quick (they have so many tables to take care of so they would rather you order quickly). 
I really liked their Thai tea. Cocktails were good too. Their famous dish is the Khao Soi. I got it with braised beef. Sooooo good! Their green curry was also amazing (it is served in a coconut!).The portion sizes are huge at this place, I think one main and one appetizer is enough for two people.
For the spice level we both got mild, which was the perfect amount of spice.
Tldr: This place is a must try if you have not been there yet!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sam S.,They're rude and not helpful. It's not as clean or well stocked as it used to be. Especially the meat department. Very questionable. A video is circulating of them drying salt fish in the dirty lane way.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela H.,"The food was amaaaaazing. We started off with the best chicken skewers ever. The meat was sooooooooo tender (not sure how they do it) and charred to the right amount.  It came with satay sauce which is the bomb, and also a vinaigrette if you prefer something lighter in between. 
For the main, we ordered the Khao Soi and Pad Thai. Where do I begin, I have never had Khao Soi before, it is egg noodle in a cocounut curry sauce. This was soooo yummy I am still thinking about it. I couldn't stop drinking the soup and the noodles soaked in the flavours. 
So. good. 
Comparatively, the pad thai lost it's luster, but don't get me wrong, it was still really good. We ordered spiciness of medium but it was more like a mild mild. 
This restaurant is always hustling and bustling, so expect a wait time. The turnover is actually quite fast and the space is bigger than it seems. 
Will definitely be back if in the area!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dy M.,"Pai is delicious! However, the prices are a bit steep. Pad Thai and a Thai Iced Tea was around $22. However, I was really hungry so I thought why not give it a try. They are on the 'feedback' app which offers discounts if you buy ramen at a certain time of the day. Though that app varies from time to time depending on whats available. 
I didn't think it was anything special, but also it was such a long line up to get in. They have a great system where you can leave a phone number and wander around in a bit. 
I think trying pad Thai was not the best choice since it was so common everywhere else. I would definitely go try again and hopefully my experience will be better!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris B.,"Amazing food, great drinks and a nice atmosphere. Would love to go back when in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karina B.,Pai never disappoints! I love their Thai green curry as well Masaman curry with rice. As a pescatarian I have plenty options. The food is always fresh and delicious!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James Z.,Eating at this restaurant is like jumping off a cliff... it's a 1 way flight to hell,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Derek H.,"Rating: 3.5
Waited about 30-40 mins on a Friday night. They didn't have the chicken skewers so we decided to get the Thai chicken wings($6 for 3). They were good but very small like pub wings and they were nothing special. For the main dishes we got khao soi and curry in coconut dish. With the hype of the Khao soi, I didn't find it anything special. The noodles were very soggy and the sauce was very oily. The curry in coconut however was very tasty. Overall it's definitely worth trying it out for the more authentic side of Thai food.
Note:
- place is very loud and gets pretty crowded
- make a reservation online or else you'll have to wait a bit",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raymond L.,"There's always a line up at Pai, and that's for good reason: the food is just amazing! Luckily, we didn't have to line up because we made a reservation (over a month in advance).
The menu is extensive and offers a great variety of drinks and authentic Thai food. My favourite dish here has got to be the Pad Thai, but you can't go wrong with the Khao Soi or curry dishes either. 
The atmosphere is lively, although it could be a bit loud. The service is very good as well. 
If you happen to be in the financial district, Pai is a fantastic place to catch up with someone over dinner, get to know somebody better, or just grab some food with a group of friends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edward Z.,"The standard against which other Thai restaurants are judged in Toronto.
The quality is very consistent, and their noodles are hearty and tasty. Pad gra prow, a spicier rice dish, is equally hearty and simple yet satisfying.
The chicken skewers are great.
Overall solid food, good decor, the delivery product is adequate and always reliable.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anthony S.,"Great tasting thai food in the heart of the entertainment district downtown Toronto
It can get very packed in here and long lineups are a frequent sighting, which speaks volumes on how great the food tastes here
Prices are very reasonable and you can get a good meal for under $20.
For my latest visit, I ordered the gaeng hunglay ox tail stew which comes with jasmine ice. My friend had the khao pad thamada stir fried rice with chicken. Both of them tasted great and we found that the ox tail stew with the thamada rice made a really kick ass combination. Tasty!!!
We got in around 6pm on a Sunday and it was decently packed, but luckily there were tables at the back for us. By the time we left around 7:15, the lineup was out the door lol. 
Get here early and you shouldn't have to wait too long for a table",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carrie L.,"I have now been to this restaurant several times. I can't get over how busy it is, even when it's only just opened at 4pm in the afternoon! 
I love their cocktails! So tasty! The wait staff is so friendly and efficient. 
All of the food I have tried there is amazing. I love the pad Thai which normally I find Boring - but not at this restaurant! Love it there! And the spring rolls are delicious. The various chicken dishes I've had are excellent. All of it. By far one of the best Thai food restaurants ever.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Priyam L.,"Hmmmm..... I would rate this place a 3.5.
The food was good but not as great as people have rated it and there was a line up half way around the block by the time we left the restaurant . 
We ordered the Khao Pad Beef, Khao Soi Chicken and the Dried Shrimp Papaya Salad. The papaya salad was my favorite dish and the sticky fried was good but not to the level of deserving a perfect rating. I will pass on the Khao Soi, if I return.
Service was prompt and friendly. It was a 20 minute wait from just outside the front door which I thought was ok, because the restaurant has a near perfect rating and was packed!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Trudy L.,"Pretty good service from servers.
Tasty peanut sauce in beef stew noodle. Paitai was also good but that Thai salad with betel leaves was most unique.
Long wait since we arrived peak time. I couldn't understand why people lined up on a Monday night to eat there till I ate that cold dish.
The raw salad ingredients included garlic, lime, red pepper, green hot pepper, fresh chopped peanuts, sweet and sour sauce plus petite shrimps, wrapped in dark green leaves.
It's the first time I saw that dish in FL or CA.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mindy G.,"Wow, this restaurant has such friendly service. Everyone from the hostess to the bartenders to the wait staff greeted us with genuine smiles on their faces. The drinks were very interesting and tasty concoctions. One had vodka and lychee, another had Thai tea and cocoa powder. If you love Thai or are new to Thai this restaurant will not disappoint. My husband had Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork. Total comfort food. Anything topped with a fried egg is a winner! I had green curry in a coconut. Curry was yummy and I also found myself snacking on the coconut itself!
The restaurant is a bit cramped but the service was outstanding and made up for that. If you come before 6:30 the wait is not too bad at all. Highly recommended!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yulia K.,"PAI has become one of my go-to restaurants for lunch-time Ritual orders if I don't have time to make my lunch ahead of time. 
The quality never disappoints and the portion size is perfect. I love the both the green curry chicken and the red curry chicken with the squash - delicious and filling. 
The service is also always great.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katie Y.,"This place is amazing!!! I ordered a Khoi Soi with beef and every bite was delicious and very flavourful. I had their coconut breaded shrimp as an appetizer and it was worth it. Super crispy and very tasteful. The Thai ice tea is a must try as well! Super refreshing and taste so good! 
The staff was super friendly and very quick service for the amount of people around lunch time. Would definitely come back here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Xingyu S.,"First Experience:
I came here with my coworkers at lunchtime. We were seated quickly despite our large party of 9 with no reservation (PAI does not ordinarily take reservations). It took sometime for our food to come after ordering, but that is understandable given the business of the lunch rush and our large group. All our food came out together and was hot and freshly cooked. All the dishes looked wonderful and authentically Thai, and smelled lovely. The dish I had was the Beef Chef Nuit Pad Thai with the Thai Spicy option. A detailed review of my dish follows:
Beef Chef Nuit Pad Thai, Thai Spicy:
This Pad Thai was delicious. The bean sprouts, beef, sliced cabbage, and crushed peanuts worked together with the sauce and noodles to create a myriad of exciting flavours and textures in every bite. The Thai Spicy option is the hottest option on the menu, and will not disappoint spice enthusiasts. For those less courageous, there are no spice, mild, medium, and farang spicy options as well. The dish was coherent and each element complemented and built off another in perfect harmony. This dish was wonderful and reaffirms PAI's reputation as THE Thai restaurant in Toronto.
Second Experience:
I don't usually review places twice, but the food warranted another review. I came to PAI again with my friends on the weekend for mother's day. We were seated incredibly quickly despite the occasion. We ordered a number of appetizers and mains. Detailed reviews of the food I tried follow:
Gaeng Masaman with braised beef:
This curry was immensely delicious. The depth and layering of flavour were incredible and the consistency was silky smooth. The beef was mouthwatering and braised to perfection. The dish was perfect, and was unbelievably enjoyable. It was a very rich, so it's best enjoyed hungry!
Grabang: 
The grabang is a tower of deep fried butternut squash fritters. It was a visually impressive appetizer, and great for sharing. It is crispy and delicious and the peanut sauce it was served with had great flavour.
Gai Satay:
These chicken skewers had a strong peanut flavour and were very good. The chicken was not dry and the cucumber dressing was a perfect pair.
Said Ua Platter: 
These pork belly sausages were wonderfully fragrant and different from any sausages I had ever had. The relish was quite tasty and complemented the sausages well.
Overall, my second experience at PAI was also incredible and I can once again affirm this restaurant as THE Thai restaurant in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Annie W.,"This is hands down my favourite Thai place in Scarborough. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but once you are inside, the decor and atmosphere instantly make you feel like you've been transported to a local eatery in Thailand. As for the dishes, my go to appetizer is the chicken toast. It's crunchy and savoury but perfectly paired with the sweet dipping sauce. PadPrik chicken with rice is the perfect amount of spicy and just so amazing-a must try. The pad Thai here is also delicious and generous in portion size!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Olya S.,"I really really enjoyed the food. I had red curry and it was delicious. My party had pad thai and she loved that as well. Very friendly and attentive service. The place has loud music and pretty close table seating, so it is not a perfect setup for a romantic dinner, but if you want great good and vibrant atmosphere, this is the place!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,emma g.,"Amazing. Only bad thing is that the wait is always long, but that's just a testament to how good the food is.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amber C.,"The service is amazing, the waitress was very attentive. The food was even better, it came out in large portions and for the right dishes, they came out hot. The food was absolutely delicious, it was that flavour kick I expect from Thai food. The price is fair for the quality. Their drinks are delicious, though a little weak. Overall, I loved the food and ambiance. 
Word of advice: make reservations or come early, the lineup gets crazy long starting at 6pm.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Allison B.,"I was really impressed with Pai Northern Thaï Kitchen ! I had heard many good things about it and went with a regular. I tried the green curry - which came with medium heat - with chicken and bamboo shoots. The cocoanut milk in the curry balanced the spice perfectly so it was not too spicy and came with a side of rice. The curry was served inside a cocoanut so extra props for creativity ! Since the cocoanut was not very large, they provided extra curry in a side bowl. I tried a bite of the pad Thai as well and it was very good. 
The atmosphere was casual and the space itself was very large, but separated into several rooms so it was easy to carry on conversation with your group. The only unfortunate event was that the fire alarms went off because someone opened a fire door. All of the staff were extremely apologetic and kind. 
 
Can't wait to go back already !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Judy H.,"Located on a small street, you might miss it as it's dark and located in the basement.  It was a packed night, but they had the reservation set up for 18 customers. The table was high and so the chairs that were provided didn't have a back support, let alone a place to hang your jacket/coat!! Many of the guest just sat on their jacket. Not convenient at all. There were hangers, but not close to our table. 
Compared to other Thai places, this place is dark and the interior design is a mix match of a carnival scene and a night market scene from Asia. 
Happy:  The veggie spring roll came out quickly and it was hot. I would have preferred a different sauce than the typical one. My main chicken curry dish came in a real coconut which was a nice appeal. (It stated in the menu.) 
Not happy:  However, it was not hot nor warm either!! I was disappointed indeed. It felt like the dish was just left there for the waiter to find. At least the jasmine rice was warm. There weren't a lot of chicken pieces, just a lot of curry sauce!! My partner suggested I say something but I was already too hungry past 9 pm. He ordered pad Thai and he said that he had it better at other restaurants. 
Verdict: I wouldn't go back. I like my food hot (in temperature) and if the cooks are not cooking it right, then there's no point in eating out. It certainly destroyed my experience! At least the service is decent.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hong M.,"Authentic Thai - AMAZING FOOD!  This is my husbands favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto (mine is Jatujak). We usually avoid going downtown, but PAI is the exception.  What we usually order: [Gai Satay Skewers] - These tender chicken skewers with a peanut sauce is an amazing starter [Morning Glory] - This is the best morning glory dish in the city! Always our go to order [Green Curry] - This is the dish that made PAI my husbands favourite Thai restaurant in the city. It is packed with flavour and very unique from other green curries as this one has a fishy taste to its curry sauce. [Khao Soi] - This one is one of my favourite Thai Dishes, and although they don't make it as well at Jatujak, their version is still pretty darn good.  Overall, Pai is a delicious authentic thai restaurant, serving up some amazing flavourful dishes. It does tend to get super busy here, so heads up!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sharon S.,"This is the best thai restaurant I have ever tried! Come here with reservations or expecting a bit of a wait. The restaurant was packed and the service was relatively quick. The curries and dishes tasted exactly as they did on my trip to Thailand! Absolutely delish and cute rustic ambiance.
Would definitely recommend coming here and I will be visiting again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Natalie W.,"Amazing food and drinks! The Pad Thai was super flavorful and hearty, the gaeng masaman was delicious. The atmosphere is very hip and cute, I can see why it's always packed at Pai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,AJ A.,"Love Thai food and came here because they offer Halal beef options. It is very authentic Thai food, the curries we ordered was very tasty. We also ordered Pad Thai with beef and it was delicious. The shrimp soup was very good, it was a little too spicy and I would recommend asking for mild if that is possible. We would come here without any hesitation.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Natasza O.,"The food here is yummy and the atmosphere brings one out of Toronto's hustle and bustle and into the ambiance of beautiful Thailand.
The service was mediocre. They had a rather bland lemongrass iced tea, which sounds really delicious on the menu, yet it was extremely disappointing when it arrived and ended up tasting like lemongrass syrup water! WAY TOO SWEET! 
The take out 'side of sticky rice' was a morsel if that. TRIPLE PACKAGED: plastic zip bag (completely unnecessary) + styrofoam + paper bag = Pai restuarant being no friend to the environment and a complete turn off for ever going back! 
I believe my 4/10 star rating is even generous!",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jamie O.,Excellent food but always busy so plan accordingly.  Probably the best Thai in the city.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mei M.,"This is probably the best Thai restaurant that's not super expensive in TO. 
Of my many times here I've gotten the fried rice, the khao soi, the pad Thai, the coconut curry. And the best is probably the fried rice here. Very rich in favour and probably the best fried rice I've ever had. 
They also have a killer sangria but their drinks are more to the pricier end. 
That said, the reason why this is not a 5 stars is because of the long wait that always exists here (30-40min wait) and the loudness of the restaurant.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Olivia V.,"After seeing all the positive reviews on Pai, my boyfriend and I just knew we had to make a reservation and give this place a try...and I'm so glad we did. 
We ended up ordering the khao soi, pad thai and grabong. Although I was surprised to find that a lot of these flavors closely resembled certain Vietnamese dishes that I'm personally very familiar with, all three dishes were amazing and the portions were generous. If I was a local, you'd probably catch me here at least once a week. The service here was also fantastic. We were promptly seated and our server was extremely sweet. I have no complaints! 
For dessert, we of course had to end with mango sticky rice. If you haven't had this dish before, I strongly encourage you to try it! You won't be disappointed. Everything here tasted incredibly fresh, particularly our dessert so I was thoroughly satisfied.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah W.,"I cannot stress this enough - make reservations. 
We came on a Friday night and it was super busy. The line outside was insane. The restaurant itself is quite large, with a fun and loud atmosphere. Don't come here to have an intimate conversation. 
Drinks took awhile to come but were worth the wait. I had the Thai iced tea cocktail which was EXACTLY what I hoped it would be. 
We started with the tom yum soup which was incredibly flavourful as well as the grabong. The squash itself was a little bland but the sauce served with it was good. 
I ordered the gaeng masaman (braised beef served with rice) which was delicious but very rich. The serving size was quite generous and I took half home as leftovers. I also tried the pork pad gra prow which was pretty good. For dessert we had mango sticky rice. This was okay. Of course the dish is made by the quality of the mango and this one wasn't terribly ripe. 
Overall service was fine and the prices were reasonable. I did enjoy myself and I would definitely return although I would say this place is a little overhyped.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Imran N.,"I've been a long time appreciator and lover of Pai.
It really is a home run when it comes to flavours. What you get here is big bold and perfect flavours, at a relatively reasonable price point.
 
What you don't get here is a relaxed atmosphere to enjoy dinner. It's very loud and designed to give you a Thai bar vibe rather than a more relaxed and formal setting like Kiin (same family of restaurants). The end result, this place is perfect for a night out before drinks (as long as you can control yourself to keep your food intake light) and a great spot for a fun lunch experience. 
As a protip, the Market concept they created for quick lunches is a great idea to eat big flavours without waiting a long time.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maria L.,"I'm not big into Thai food so Chicken Pad Thai is my go to option at any Thai restaurant. The Pad Thai here was good but took a while to come out. The noodles were also softer than I'm used to but the flavour was delicious, and the portions will fill you right up. 
My friend got the curry which came in a coconut bowl which was pretty interesting. I'll be sure to get that next time!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lucy C.,"hmm I think Pai has improved over the years.
I actually wasn't a huge fan of the pad gra prow, pad Thai or Chiang Mai noodles here before, but from my recent visit, the food was better than I remembered.
Sangria is nice and sweet here. Service is cool too. 
Loved the pad gra prow this time, but I wouldn't get it with the crispy pork next time because it was a bit hard.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna F.,Some of the best thai in the city. Really great - highly recommended!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Niyat G.,"Great food, always a delight. Can't wait to go back. I love to recommend to newcomers to the city.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexandra S.,Holy actual shit. The Khao Soi...I get it every time I go. I am physically unable to get anything different.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,NastyError3 ..,"food so serious man, the green curry was very very good and the chicken satay was cooked perfect as well",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rui S.,"They managed to get two of us a table in 15 minutes on a Sunday night, which was surprising and impressive considering how popular this place is. We ordered the most popular dishes: Khao Soi, small tom yum soup, green curry and mango sticky rice. They were all 5 star dishes. The sticky rice was  chewy and sweet, the mango was a little dry though. Might as well order the sticky rice as a side. The green curry had bamboo roots, so if you do not like the smell of it, you better avoid it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel C.,Got the pad Thai with chicken and shrimp and 1/2 lb of wings. The sauce with the wings is amazing and wings were super crispy. Pad Thai was one of the best I've had. Would 1000% come back,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Caroline D.,"Meh...for the wait and reviews I was so excited to eat here but my local strip mall Thai place has the same or better food. The shining light was their cocktails. 
Pad Thai is my judgement dish and they didn't hit the mark.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina W.,"4.5 stars on yelp? Well deserved. They use some kind of spices that make their food seem like it's on steroids. Everything was so aromatic, tasty, fresh, and authentically Thai.
The atmosphere is loud and resembles a market-esque restaurant. The line goes out the door, so you better grab a reservation or get takeout if you want to be in and out of this place.
For appetizers, we ordered the northern Thai sausage. You could tell that the sausage was made in house and was stuffed with fresh herbs and spices. 
It came with a house special sauce for dipping, sticky rice, and some crunchy lettuce/cucumbers. The combination has various textures and flavours that compliment each other and accent the juicy sausage. Definitely would order this again.
The khao soi that is so loved at this location, has definitely earned its reputation. The coconut milk, spices, chicken, and egg noodles were prepared to perfection. Best khao soi I've had so far. I would also want to sample the beef version in the future.
Bf got the masaman chicken which he loved as well.
For dessert, we ordered the mango sticky rice. My boyfriend was surprised because he said that the mango they used reminded him of the sweet juicy mangoes he's used to from Taiwan. Tastes like candy and they coat the sticky rice with a touch of condensed milk. Highly recommend this for dessert.
The bill was quite pricey, coming to $70 for the both of us. It was definitely worth every penny. The spices and food are too good to miss if you're in the area. We will be back again soon!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tolu A.,"The food at Pai is delicious. A little bit over-priced, but the quality is consistent.
The atmosphere is a little dim and cozy, but the seating leaves something to be desired, when it's crowded it feels like I can barely move.
I find myself coming back for the food and it's consistent quality.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anum H.,"Finally had a chance to try Pai! I've been meaning to try this place for a while and have always been discouraged by the long line ups. 
Now I understand the hype! 
Came here on a Sunday around 6pm, and waited around 30 mins for a table. Ordered some drinks: Sangria and Tea Mac (thai iced tea + vodka) highly recommended if you're a fan of Thai iced tea. 
For dinner, we had the chicken satay with peanut sauce (good flavours), chicken Pad Thai (pretty good), but the star of the meal was the Pad Gra Prow with beef - highly recommend this dish! 
Overall: good, efficient service, good drinks, great food, would def return, and maybe even wait a bit longer!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Charlotte S.,"Food was DELICIOUS! Seriously, really good. The Thai iced tea is amazing as well. Place had a great vibe, and service was great even though it was very busy. Be prepared for a line because this place is so popular, but know you'll have a great time once you're in!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tammy N.,"Be ready to wait, since this place always has a line! It is worth it though, their curries are so decadent and satisfying. I used to only get green curry at thai restaurants, but once I tried my friends khao soi and have been ordering that ever since! I love the combo of noodles in the soup and crispy noodles protruding out of the dish, it gives a lot of texture to the meal. I usually get it mild or medium spice level, since their scale of spicy is a bit higher than what I am used to. I would recommend erring on the side of caution when it comes to spice level until you know what you can handle. Definitely recommend that everyone tries Pai at least once while in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John T.,"Most unique Thai restaurant I have ever been to not just in Toronto but ever! If you get a chance to while you wait to be seated, check out the story of how the restaurant was started, great stuff. 
I would advise calling to make a reservation, the place was super busy (even on a Thursday night). 
Once seated, we ordered the fried butternut squash and chicken wings, I could eat the fried squash everyday for the rest of my life. It was so freaking darn good. For the main course, we tried the pad Thai and the green curry, I thought the pad Thai was a little light on flavoring and the green curry was lukewarm. I think due to the crazy dinner rush, they got a little sloppy on the prep but the items tasted great.
Finally, the drinks here are off the hook! I recommend the sangria, light and refreshing! Mmm mmm mmm! Butternut squash and sangria!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kishoor V.,Always wanted to check this place out and finally got the opportunity. Pad Thai was A1. What really added onto the delicious food was the authentic dining experience.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sheryll C.,"Visiting Toronto from Cali and wanted something different and tasty, with a great vibe... randomly chose this spot.. highly recommend...!! Try the Gaeng Hunglay with Oxtail..",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tejpal S.,"Got a spot on one of their outdoor patios during my honeymoon. Ordered the Gaeng Masaman with Braised Beef and was greeted with an absolutely beautiful dish. Service is top notch, and the wait isn't too long. 
Pricing is very reasonable as well. I highly recommend making a reservation otherwise the wait for a table can be long.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anya M.,"Went there 3 times 
Went there with group of f people and ordered few different dishes to try,,all was good.Very busy ,long line little bit to much to wait on weekends but worth it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jocelyn C.,"If you want authentic Thai food with great flavours, you have to check this place out! The chef from Khao San Road branched out and started up Paid. It's bigger than Khao San (so your chances of getting a table at lunch is increased exponentially). We got a table for 1:00 on a Friday for 7 people, only because someone knows the manager, otherwise, be ready to wait 10-30 minutes for a table.
I had the khao soi (egg noodles in golden curry, with a choice of braised beef, chicken breast or drumstick). The flavour and spices were great! The crispy noodle gave it a nice crunch, just wished there was more of it! As the whole dish was in the curry, I felt it was too much. They should separate the noodles from the curry. The Thai iced tea was great (similar to the Hong Kong style tea) - sweet, milky, lots of ice.
If you're in the mood for Thai food and are in the entertainment district, check this place out!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jinho M.,"A little expensive and there is always a huge wait and line for walk-ins. The food is great and the appetizer platter is amazing. That being said, I feel like this place has been pretty inaccessible after it gained its popularity",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tanya H.,"This is was a great experience. I got the khao soi, which was heavenly. However, i had a few bites of my boyfriend's pad thai, which was not out of the world or anything (but not bad?) just-- the desserts are overpriced which made me sad bc i really wanted to try their mango sticky rice. I'm not a fan of rum but my bf loved their thai mojito so much-- i didnt think it was overly sweet or anything like someone down there in the reviews said. Still, if i ever come back to toronto im definitely coming back for more khao soi. Loved!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tanya H.,"We ordered take-out because the wait was too long. Our 5 meals took about 30-40 minutes to make, which is understandable considering how busy it was. 
.... AND THE WAIT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT! I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with ground pork. This must be eaten with the magical fish sauce that comes with it. Once mixed in, the meal is extra delicious and has a unique taste to it. This is the best Thai food I've EVER had. I am definitely going to go back!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katrina S.,"I LOVED Pai. The wait was long as we came on a Saturday night, but it moved quickly and was worth it! We had been told before that the place was huge but didn't realize it until we were brought to our table walked through - it IS big! 
The food was really good. We got the Khao Soi, Pad Thai,  and Fritter and nothing disappointed. We've been looking for pad Thai here that reminded us of Bangkok and this is the best we've had in a lonnnnnnng time. So delicious! (And not red. Always a plus! Hehe). 
The servers were courteous and even though it was busy we didn't feel left behind or ignored at all. Loved the feel of the restaurant and unique vibe. 
Can't wait to go back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kyle J.,I ordered the Pad gra prow with chicken. Lots of rice. Very little chicken. It was tasty but definitely over priced Thai. Did take out and they didn't include any cutlery :( apparently you need to ask in advance so heads up.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Airell s.,Food was Gold! It was delicious and the atmosphere was great. You might have to wait but it's worth the wait. One of the best in town!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cindy C.,"I love Pai! It's my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. The food is consistently delicious and authentic to the flavours of Thailand (I've spent a month there). Their typical Thai dishes like Pad Thai and green curry are really great. It's my favourite pad Thai in the city. Another thing I've never seen on any other menus is their Miang Kung which comes as a make your own mini wraps with betel leaves, cooked shrimp and a variety of finely diced aromatics like ginger and scallion as well as lime and pomelo for some tartness. Add a little bit of the tamarind sauce and peanuts and you've got yourself a flavour bomb. 
Another dish they do really well is their Khao Soi. The portion is very generous and the yellow curry sauce is very rich. Highly recommend! For apps, I love their Moo Ping pork skewers, they're sticky, charred and full of fatty deliciousness. You can cut the rich flavours with a refreshing Thai iced tea that's made with sweetened condensed milk. Honestly, all their food is so good here! 
The vibe is very fun here too, very busy, a bit loud and decorated with fun bits and bobs that give a throwback to the town of Pai which is where the owner originally opened her first curry house. Make reservations 48 hours in advance or expect to way when you get there. I recommend going early for best availability.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brandon B.,"We were in town for Pride and stumbled on this place scrolling through Yelp.  What a gem of a place!  
The decor is on point and the place is spotless.  We were sat at a nice large table on a raised platform.  We were asked to take off our shoes but I don't think that's how it was everywhere, just our table.  
We started with spring rolls which were well made, if not standard.  
For dinner, I got the Khao Soi and it was pretty striking.  They put crispy noodles in vertically.  They know what they're doing as it's a great shot.  
The service was efficient and quick.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jon W.,"Great place and fabulous food. Had heard that they get really busy so went early shortly after they opened for the day (4:30pm). Was seated and we ordered four dishes: pad Thai, panang curry, Khao Soi and Laab salad. All of dishes were just tasty and delicious. 
Service was good with the server coming by often to check on things and to refill our glasses",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Claire G.,"Lovely and sweet story of the restaurant... ...
Thai Chicken Wings and Pad Thai are soooo good！",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patrick G.,"We dined at PAI on a recent vacation in Toronto. It's a somewhat cavernous, busy, noisy venue with a good variety of Thai favorites. Service was adequate.
For starters, grabong was a substantial choice; the looming mound of squash frites was tasty, but a bit larger than we bargained for. We tried the Pad Thai based on a review we'd read; it was OK (better than the typical U.S. version, but not outstanding). Pad Gra Prow had more complexity. In both entrées, the spice levels were just as we ordered.
If you need a Thai fix in Toronto, PAI is A-OK.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Oren B.,"The best Thai food in Toronto - hands down
Everything chef Nuit makes is incredible.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adam H.,"There was a long line to put in our name on the waiting list. Normally I would of moved onto the next location, but we waiting it out.  Soon enough we were at the bar enjoying a Thai beer and seated shortly after. I ended up ordering beef soup. It was legit.  
There were 2 tables where you could sit on the ground and eat at a low table.  I would suggest calling ahead to reserve it if you can remember!
Atmosphere was solid. It would be a perfect place for a first date, party, or just a regular night out with friends to enjoy Thai food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jack J.,"Amazing atmosphere, great staff and the best Thai food in Toronto. Highly recommended! (also great for children)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melina S.,"Best Thai food I've ever tried. 
The staff is friendly the food delicious. Beer is great too.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J L.,"Decent Thai food. I got the pad thai with chicken and medium spice. There wasn't a hint of spice and there was absolutely no kick at all - maybe I should have gone up a notch on the spice meter? The chicken pieces were nice and tender, perfectly cooked. The overall dish was on the greasy/oily side, but the flavours were nice and savoury, veering more toward the sweet/sugary side than spicy.
The garlic shrimp appetizers were the winner. At 6 pieces for $13, it's on the pricey side but they were so good and so worth it. Super crispy and paired well with the sweet chili sauce.
The Thai iced tea was pretty much highway robbery at $5.75 and filled with 50% ice - not worth getting. While it looks like the cup is completely filled, the smashed ice isn't noticeable until you take a few sips and realize you're halfway done your drink.
Overall, I'm glad I got a chance to try it but there's nothing that makes me want to re-visit.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raina R.,Great space. Staff helpful. Food mid-range Thai. Noisy young crowd. Steps up a killer. Had an elevator but only noticed it on the way out. Love procecco with Thai food.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lela B.,"The place is small, the wait is long but the food is worth it! We arrived right at 4:45 and took a seat at the bar. By 5:00pm, PNTK was packed and had a line - and I can see why. Their food is authentic, fresh and seasoned to perfection. Their drinks pair wonderful with anything you order on the menu. Order the Khao Soi! You won't be disappointed !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maberry Y.,"Came here on a Saturday night around 8:30 PM and waited about 20 minutes for a table. We ordered the pad Thai, spring rolls and the green curry. 
Part of the green curry was served in a coconut, which was a nice touch. The coconut itself was tasty and the meat added a nice crunch to the curry. The green curry itself was pretty average and comparable to other good Thai places, nothing outstanding. Spring rolls were also indistinguishable from AYCE buffets. 
The pad Thai was exceptional. Other places taste just sweet - but this place hit all the spots. A real depth of flavour that's often lacking in Americanized pad Thai joints. Only comment is be careful of the spice level. The Thai Spicy level is NO JOKE. Unless you love eating extremely spicy food, be very careful when ordering this!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danthanh L.,"A friend and I were feeling the munchies and decided to check this place out. 
The restaurant is located under street level so you need to walk down a few stairs (a concern only if you have mobility issues). Lighting is low/dim but thats part of the vibe/atmosphere. I found the staff friendly, quick and efficient. There is plenty of seating but it does quickly fill up after 6/7pm. If you have a big group, there is a private room in the back or a tatami style area in the front near windows that has 2 large tables with cushions (I would definitely visit again just to sit there lol). 
For food, I had the popular Thai Ice Tea and Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Chicken. Both very tasty! The Thai tea was refreshing and the Pad Thai had a nice sauce for the rice noodles.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joshua C.,"Lives up to hype. 
Food so good. Lovely to an enjoyable level. 
Recommend for all. 
Easy 5 stars.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer K.,"Stepping inside Pai Northern Thai Kitchen transfers me back to Northern Thailand where the food is spicy and flavoured, people is friendly and nice, and the weather is hot and hotter....
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is a heavenly place for me.
We were luckily to arrive at around 11:30 when it opened on a weekday and right before the lunch crowd came in. Make a reservation if you have a big group, you won't regret that. For singles, there is always the bar area if you just want a quick meal.
Lunch menu is limited but includes most of my favourite items. My NYC guest wanted to try everything........ and of course being a wonderful host, I let her go crazy a little.
We ended up sharing:
Papaya Salad with Dried Shrimp ($10)
Chef Nuit's Pad Thai with Chicken ($12)
Pad Gra Prow with Egg ($12)
Mango Pandan Sticky Rice ($8)
Thai Iced Tea ($4.50) for my guest
I should not had used the word ""sharing"" as my guest just have a few mouthful of appetizer and mains and declared them too spicy for her. I was kind of happy to stuck with finishing everything! Aside from the dessert!
Dinner menu has some interesting item which I would love to try. I guess I would be coming back. Again and Again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Misty S.,"They have a small lunch menu here but the choices all sound delicious...Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup, Massaman with Braised Beef and Rice, Thai Omelette with Ground Pork and Rice, and Khao Soi to name a few.  Also not the typical choices you have at most Thai restaurants, which is a nice change of pace.  It's like a menu of Thai comfort food.  
For my first time here, I dined in.  A couple of my friends ordered the Tom Yum soup and raved about it.  It looked pretty good loaded with shrimps, mushrooms and whatnots.  I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she said everything is good but one of her favorites is the Pad Gra Prow.  After going with that, I decided I could dine here every day and did so for the next 3 days.  I'm hesitant to order the pad Thai because I tried a bite of my friend's pad Thai and didn't like it (soggy and bland).  
Pad Gra Prow (pork with basil) with Fried Egg ($12) - One of my favorite dishes in Thailand but is rarely done right elsewhere.  However, they did it very right here, top notch. The flavors were authentic (could be saltier as it was on the sweet side) and delicious!  It even came with a side of chili fish sauce (prik nam pla!), which was not needed, but was nice to be offered.  The pork was minced to perfection.  The portion of rice given was also spot on.
Thai Omelette with ground pork and rice $12 was absolutely tasty.  This is not your traditional omelette as it was deep fried scramble eggs.  It had ground pork but it also had dried shredded pork (moo yong), which I haven't had in the longest time.  There were also basil, onion and red pepper that added to the great flavor of this dish.
Massaman with Braised Beef and Rice $12 - If you're in the mood for coconut based red curry, tender beef, and potatoes, you'll like this dish.  There are also onions and peanuts in here which I really enjoyed.
Thai chicken fried rice $11 - It was ok, kinda plain.  I got it as a takeout and it could have used some fish sauce.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any at the office.  Where's the prik nam pla when I needed it?
Small Tom Yum Soup $5 - This soups is pretty good.  I got it medium spicy and it was just the right amount of spiciness.  There were 2 jumbo shrimps in the soup.
Thai Ice Tea ($4.50) - They didn't have Thai ice coffee, so I went with this.  It's a bit more expensive than other places, but they do give you a big cup of it.  
Mango and sticky rice $8 - One of my favorite Thai desserts.  It was good here, but not quite $8 good.   I'll can go to Sabai Sabai for my Thai dessert fix for $5.
The service was friendly.  The décor is nice and gives the place a Thai ambience and not just Thai themed.  The take out counter is in the back towards the kitchen.  They take credit cards, including American Express.
I read that the owners are also part owners of Sukho Thai and consultants at Sabai Sabai and used to be associated with Khao San Road.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tapan P.,"Amazing food. I ordered the Pad Thai and chicken satay. Good, informal ambience. There was a 25 min wait, but it was well worth it. 
Note: ""Farang (foreigner) spicy"" was spicy for me. So order accordingly!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karen L.,"Pai is brought to you by the same people from Khao San Road and Sukho Thai.  Due to various circumstances, they are no longer affiliated with KSR.  (I hated the ridiculous line ups there anyways.)
This location is currently on a soft launch and there has been little to zero media attention.  You're only going to know about it through word of mouth, or a walk-by.  However, word is going to get out really fast and the lines will be inevitable.  
The food is delicious!  Tons of flavours, spices, and levels of heat.  Noodle dishes, rice dishes, vegetarian fare...  Something for everyone.  
Friendly and helpful service.  No liquor license as of yet but soon to come.  
If you want authentic Thai food, give this place a try.  You won't regret it.  
Why 4 stars?  I want to check out the full menu.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Iris S.,"Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to outside of Thailand. 
Don't let the long line deter you, it moves very fast. I particularly like how personalized all the wall decor is. Leading into the restaurant, there is a collage of how the restaurant owners met and started the business. There are lots of pictures with various patrons (not just famous ones). 
They have a focus towards rice based dishes and while their menu is not extensive, every single dish we tried was phenomenal. 
For apps we got the papaya salad. I really like the side of cabbage to cut the saltiness of the fish sauce and the chiccaron 
The Tom yum is spicy and delicious. The dish is actively heated by an open flame (but weirdly enough is only a tad bit hotter than room temperature) 
The pad gra prow is amazing. I love the crisp pork belly intertwined with the minced meat. The fried egg is perfectly cooked. We asked for super spicy and for me it was just mild. I did get chili oil on the side which helped
Lastly the braised beef khao soi was unforgettable. The coconut soup base is very thick and creamy. The egg noodles perfectly chewy. It also comes with a fried egg noodle garnish that we broke up and placed in the broth as well. 
The only not great thing at this place was the sangria. It tasted delicious. Lots of fruit and very tropical. However i couldn't taste any liquor at all. So, I probably would just get juice instead or a beer.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David G.,"Don't waste my time with online ordering prompts that lead to a screen that says ""pickup is not available today "" -- it's foolish and inconsiderate to treat potential customers that way.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Derek N.,"Overall: 4 stars for amazing Thai food, friendly faces, bustling hot atmosphere. I've come back mainly because I was so impressed with the food. It's pricier and portions aren't huge, but this is balanced by high quality food and taste. 
Food:
Not sure what more my review might add to what's already been said, but the food here is among the best Thai I've had in Toronto.
I started off with the chicken skewers (Gai satay) and they were amazing. The skewers were very tender, juicy and flavourful.
I tried their Pad Gra Prow in both pork and crispy pork. Personally I really preferred the crispy pork. It was crunchy, juicy and tender. The egg came put perfectly and the rice was delicious. 
I tried both the Goeng Klaw Wan (curry in a coconut and the Goeng Masaman (red curry). What stood out most to me was how rich each curry was. It was full bodied and creamy. I found myself tremendously impressed with the food. Medium spicy was fine by the way. 
Service:
This is a bit of a difficult topic. They are very busy and popular. They try their best to accommodate but because of the traffic, I found that while the faces were friendly, it was hard to find my server. Getting drinks or refills was difficult because it's very noisy, and the waiters/waitresses are constantly on the go. 
Ambience:
I love the decor. It's very spacious inside. There is loud upbeat music playing. This is not the kind of restaurant you want to go to for a quiet conversation. You will find yourself using your outdoor voice to communicate. The patio might be a better option for conversation.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raymond M.,"A dark, hectic, loud basement that is surprisingly large. Service is excellent and when it's busy you have the choice of a shared table which adds to the communal experience.
There could be a wait but there is a holding bar so it's not so bad. Bottom line, food is absolutely spectacular. Most other reviewers seem to agree so I won't go on.  A must if you're in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wendy C.,"Overrated and overpriced. We came here with high hopes of enjoying good thai food at around 3 PM on a Saturday. We had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table but it was fine since you could enjoy a drink at the bar while waiting. When it was time, we finally got seated in a small table. Our waiter was barely paying attention even though we were sitting right next to cashier. The food came out and the portions were small for the price. I didn't really enjoy my meal as there was barely any meat and more curry than anything. When we were done with our meal, I was still hungry so you can tell how small the portions were... It was definitely not worth the money.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer V.,"Now that my office moved closer to Pai (I used to be located closer to Sukhothai on Wellington), i often go to Pai for take out (via Ritual). I've tried other thai restaurants in the city and nothing even comes close. 
My go-to is their pad thai, often opting to add shrimp to my chicken pad thai. Servings are always filling and never disappoint. 
I prefer Sukhothai only because they have cashew chicken and calamari (both fantastic!),  so their menu is different, but they both have pad thai :) 
Highly recommend reservations especially during peak times like lunch and after work. Otherwise be prepared to wait,  because the food is that good!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brianna B.,"This American fell in love with Canada during her work trip! Such a diverse city with diverse flavors, such as Thai! This restaurant was recommended by a food blogger friend based in Toronto and her review to me was accurate! I went for lunch after working hard at an event and it certainly hit the spot! It was crowded for lunch so you know it's a popular joint! 
We wanted the traditional seating to get the entire experience. Must say our legs cramped up after a while but at least we experienced it!! 
I tried various versions of pad Thai and all were very flavorful. 
I recommend ordering tea on a cold day. The shared pot of green tea sure did warm these Floridians up!
The location is very close to CN Tower and Union Station, so easy to walk to. Not so easy to Uber to with the construction right now.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cynthia V.,"We loved Pai Kitchen! We were vacationing in Downtown Toronto and this was the first restaurant we ate during our stay. We decided to go here because of the great reviews and I'm GLAD we did. We ordered the beef curry, pad Thai, and egg rolls. Food had the right amount of spice and was freshly made. I would have given 5 stars if the staff would have been a little more attentive and friendly.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,H L.,"This place is obnoxious, overpriced, food is repetitive.
The ambiance is super cheesy and tries to be a dive bar. It is full of hipsters. Another example of a Toronto spot trying way too hard to be NYC. Get your own identity.
The prices are just silly. You get two winglets for 10$. Not even the whole wing! You can't even share something like that. The bigger dishes are just full of filler like fried taro. Everything seems to have the same flavour base of a coconut curry with some basil. 
Very boring place.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Miranda K.,This place is amazing! The atmosphere is trendy and cute. The food is so good. The best pad Thai I've ever had! I highly recommend going here. They have thai iced tea and amazing cocktails. I feel this is a hidden place but I'm so glad I found this place on Yelp because it was the best place I ate during my Toronto weekend!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vicky S.,"I came here at 4 pm on a Friday and it's super packed. I sat by the bar and the waiter was very nice and communicative. I ordered spring rolls and regular Tom Yum soup with rice. The spring rolls came pretty fast and it was delicious. The Tom Yum Soup however, was served a little warmer than cold.  I had to ask the waiter to heat it up for me.... the waiter was very nice to return it back to the kitchen and then brought it back to me. The second time it was warmer than the first time - but yet not as good or hot enough for me and the last time I had it a year ago.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ana B.,"Oh... My gosh. I can't overstate how amazing this place is. The décor is funky and interesting, the space is massive, the service is quick and efficient, and the price point is absolutely more than reasonable. My boyfriend and I got two apps, four drinks, and two mains - the bill came out to $100. Especially considering the quality, this was an incredibly pleasant surprise.
For apps, we got the garlic shrimp and chicken skewers. Both were fantastic. The shrimp were generous sizes and came with an incredible sauce that was sweet and a bit sour and overall perfectly complemented the shrimp. The chicken was juicy and came with a peanut sauce my boyfriend and I basically fought over, and a cucumber sauce that was refreshing and tangy.
For mains, I got the chicken green curry in a coconut. My boyfriend got the beef pad thai. We were both beyond excited and groaning with delight through pretty much every bite. The pad thai was medium spicy but nothing over the top, and I got my curry mild spicy because I wasn't sure just how spicy the medium would be. The chili oil we got on the side helped me bring it up to a good spiciness although next time I'll definitely go for the medium. For context, I put scotch bonnet sauce on pretty much everything, if that helps give an idea of my spice tolerance.
Drink-wise, we both got the shot that was on special (the raptor, which was basically just stoli but with an ""herb blend"" that we couldn't actually taste, lol. Fine by me as vodka is a personal preference of mine). Boyfriend got the STEIN (aka huge amount) of Sapporo which is on special Sundays and Mondays, and I got the Lowry - effectively a gin mojito, absolutely filled to the gills with mint. It was delicious and dangerous, since I couldn't taste the gin at all despite it being 1.5oz. 
We waited maybe 5 minutes (this was on a Monday at 6pm), and were out the door within about an hour, I'd say. The place was full but the staff were totally on their A-game, and at no point did I have to wonder ""where's our server?""
Basically, by the end of the meal we had very, VERY enthusiastically determined this was our favourite restaurant in the city. It'll be hard to go anywhere else on date night now.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melanie B.,"Our concierge at the hotel suggested we try this restaurant - particularly because my friend is gluten free. It was terrific! He warned us that there would be lines and a bit of a wait, but we arrived around 5:40 pm on a Friday and waited only 5 minutes. They had just opened two seating areas so the traffic flowed fast. I had Pad Thai and my friend had curry. Both were incredible. I also had the Kawain Punch. It was good and refreshing. The atmosphere was incredible and we didn't want to leave! It did get loud so we finally headed out. Very good food and excellent device.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chaun S.,So the only bad thing I ha r to say is I don't live in a Canada I'm a New Yorker. Best Thai food I've ever had and I love Thai food. If I lived here I'd frequent Pai weekly ! Best Thai for I've ever had. The cocktails were decent too.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bhavika P.,"Visiting Canada as a tourist and getting awesome food feels awesome.
Amazing Thai cuisine. Loved the ambience. Very busy place but was worth waiting for 20-25 mins for the delicious food. 
Veg and tofu Thai curry - served in coconut. Very rich taste of the curry. Lots of veggies and tofu.
Khao soi - Had this first time and it was sooooo delicious. Chicken was so tendered and the curry was very very tasty. 
Mango sticky rice - OMG! Haven't had better mangoes then this place. 
I hope they open in Philadelphia!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kitty W.,"The hype is real for this one.. sorta. 
I tried almost everything off their appetizers and their appetizers are to die for! Their fried shrimp and a spring roll like item (totally blanking out on names now) are absolutely divine. We loved the chicken wings too. I would visit again just for the appetizers. 
Now for the entrees .. my fiancé and I both got the famous khao soi and it was not good. The bowl was huge but there were so little noodles inside and the curry was way too salty. I do not understand why people are raving about this dish.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex T.,"This is my #1 place to get pad thai. I love pad thai and I've been in search of a place for years that can compare. 
Atmosphere is really nice, great place to go with friends. There's always a line-up to get in, so you know it's good.
Food: Deeelicous!
I think this is probably the best place in the city to get Thai, if you disagree with me please tell me what compares cuz I'd love to try! haha.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,D'Arcy L.,"Excellent Thai in a super cool setting. You enter into to the restaurant head downstairs and observe that it is definitely a popular place. We were very fortunate to get a table on walk in. The crowd is very Toronto downtown. Urban, many young professionals and people looking and sounding like they were having a good time. It sure was a boisterous place. The scents in the air of coconut curry's and delicious Thai food get the salivary glands dripping. 
What I came here with laser focus was to try the Khao Soi. Where I live in MTL Khao Soi is pretty much non existent. The creamy flavours and spices is what I was seeking. Man oh man was it decadent, rich a bit sweeter than I've had it before however delicious non the less. We really enjoyed the dish. Also we had ordered the chicken satay and a Pad Thai (which my daughter could eat some). The satay was creamy and the peanut sauce I could lick the serving plate clean it was that good. However I try to keep some composure especially in a fine dining establishment such as this. The pad Thai was creamy as well. Overall everything was good. I'd agree with another reviewer that they tend to put a bit more sugar in the dishes here as people tend to enjoy this more in North America. It was decadent and rich.
Service was really friendly and accommodating. At first they put us at a table in the corner. Than another table opened up sitting cross legged style and we asked if we could move to this. The accommodated and it was appreciated. Lots of very interesting nice Thai accents through out the restaurant. Definitely a winner and high quality Thai food!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Timothy H.,"Heard great things about Pai, so made plans to visit while in Toronto and booked a reservation ahead of time.The vibe of the place is interesting - almost like a grunge meets hipster with a dash of asian. 
Service was fine. Food was fine. Prices seemed on the high end for Thai food, but the $ matches the feel/ambiance they're going for.
Not sure if I've just been spoiled by the Asian food in California, but overall we left feeling underwhelmed based on the reviews and the hype.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole C.,"I came here with a friend for a birthday lunch and tried the khao soi. Now I usually don't finish my food (I'm a snacker) but I ate the WHOLE thing it was so good. I also had the mango sticky rice for dessert, which made me pretty darn happy. This is a great place to have authentic thai food and just to hang out with a friend. The decor is mismatched with a cohesive feel. Just go forth and enjoy good thai food!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Suor K.,"From what I understand, Pai is brought to you by some of the same people who launched Khao San Road. I came in here for a late lunch (2:30pm). Craving Thai food, KSR was closed, which made Pai a welcome addition to the neighborhood. At 2:30pm, the restaurant only had a few tables with guests so we had our pick. Although there weren't many patrons, service was slow. When we walked in, there were 3 waiters who passed menus to each other until one of them agreed to seat us.
It took a while to get someone to take our order. I ordered the Thai iced tea and the green curry. It took a long time for the iced tea to be delivered. The iced tea comes with crushed ice, likely because it's super sweet. Granted it's really good, but once you start getting closer to the bottom it gets sweeter. The green curry was very tasty and reminded me of the curry at KSR.
Overall the food is excellent. The service on the other hand could use some work.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike M.,"Haven't had much Thai food in Toronto but I'm glad we stumbled upon this place.  The decor is really nice inside, makes you feel like you're in a Thai market.  The food here is insane.  We ordered 5 different dishes to share with the table and I cannot think of a single dish that disappointed.  My favorite overall was the Laap salad(recommended by the server).  Come here with a big group, have a few drinks or sake bombs, and enjoy the delicious food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sanjay H.,"When you walk past the door and see dozens of people lining up outside a restaurant when there are plenty of other great choices within a few steps, you know there is something special about it. And Pai did not disappoint! As much of a struggle as it was to get down the narrow stairway to the crowded and noisy waiting area for our table with our stroller, once we were shown to our table through a labyrinth of dining rooms (the place is huge inside - don't let the tiny entrance fool you!) it was all amazing. The food was tasty, authentic, and unique. The service was quick, drinks were tasty, and the staff was friendly, helpful, and flexible!
This is definitely a must visit spot on Toronto if you enjoy Thai food, and are not intimidated by crowds and lines and patient enough to wait a few minutes for a table!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joy M.,"I've never eaten in the main restaurant, just the takeout market in the back. I believe there's only 4 or 5 things on the menu that change occasionally. They have picnic tables set up so you can eat there if you like, which we always do. I love the khao soi. You get a huge flavourful bowl. I'm stuffed by the time I leave. Service is quick and the staff are lovely. One of these days I will suck it up and stand in line for a table in the restaurant.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ahmed S.,"The best Thai in the city - I am likely 1/1000000 of all the reviews that shares this opinion. I've been going here since this opened and Pai has remained the top of my list of Thai eats. Sure, I hate waiting for my table because it is so busy but I can't blame everyone else there! Blindly pick anything on the menu and it will be worth it - here are a few of my favorites on the menu: 
GRABONG
CHEF NUIT PAD THAI
FRIED FISH
GAENG MASAMAN
PAD GRA PROW.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie T.,"Not as good as the hype!
I was excited to try Pai after my experience at Khao San Road. However, we might have ordered the wrong dishes because I was not that impressed.
I highly recommend reservations. We went on a weekday for dinner and there was still a 20-30 min wait.
We sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice and offered recommendations. I noticed that he was probably new as he had two glasses as ""examples"" for how much liquid he should pour for the drinks (see pictures).
I got a Thai Iced Tea ($4.50). I would not recommend it - I felt like I had diabetes from drinking it. Also, it was not filled up to the top. I think he needs an example of the Thai iced tea drink to follow too!
The bartender suggested we try the Pad Gra Prow, beef with crispy pork. It did not live up to expectations. It was okay, I guess, but not great. For $15, it was a good enough portion for one person, but a bit expensive for some beef and pork on top of rice.
We also got the green curry, gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut, $15. We got mild spicy and it was more like a medium spicy, I think. Also, it needed more rice. There was so much curry that we were basically drinking a curry soup that had rice at the bottom. It came with a lot of stuff inside too: basil, shrimp, and bamboo shoots. There was so much that they had to put some shrimp in a separate bowl (according to the bartender). I liked this dish - very delicious - they scrape the inside of the coconut and put it in the curry too. I just think they should give more rice!!!
I think I would come back but not get the Thai iced tea and I would order what I know will be good. The Khao Soi, for example. I really regret the Thai Iced Tea. And next time I'll make reservations.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grace K.,"My friends and I have waited 3+ years to get into this restaurant. We make a trek to Toronto every year and Pai has either been closed for a holiday or had a massive wait every time we've visited. And then we discovered the online reservation booking system and finally got a reservation a month out for 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon. Hurrah! Having just heavily biked around Toronto, we were so hungry and could hardly wait to get our food. I was a little worried the food couldn't meet all the anticipation built up over the years. That was not the case. There wasn't a dish we ordered we didn't like. Of the dishes I ordered and tried of my friends', my favorites were the kha soi, green coconut curry, and tom yum. I loved the delicious texture from the bundle of crispy noodles on top of the kha soi. The coconut curry broth was so flavorful and had the perfect consistency. The green coconut curry was served in a coconut shell with extra curry that couldn't fit into the shell served on the side in a bowl. Flavors were also amazing. The Thai iced tea was perfect for such a hot afternoon. The server was friendly and didn't rush us despite the super long waiting line next to the door. Absolutely loved my experience at Pai, this is THE place to visit for amazing Thai food in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley C.,"TLDR: Five stars from someone who has lived close (ish) to Pai for four years and always defaults to it for Thai food.
The ambiance is great here, feels very streets-of-Thailand-esque, and has very cool decor. Note that it's always busy, for good reason, so be prepared to put your name down and wait! I've eaten here in person several times, but I get takeout on Ritual often to skip the line. 
As someone who frequents Pai, here is the verdict.
Must try: 
- Chef nuit pad thai: Generally you can judge a thai restaurant by how well they do their pad thai. The serving size is huge, so be mindful of that (it's great value)! Pai does a solid pad thai, and comes with either chicken, beef, pork, or tofu/veggies. All of the flavours are great, and is just the right amount of sauce and garnish!
- Khao soi: My personal favourite with braised beef. Egg noodles topped with a golden curry. 
- Thai iced tea: SO GOOD. Just do it.
- Tom yum soup: The presentation of this is cool, and it comes heated by flame! Tom yum soup is delicious, has a great kick of spice! They are also quite generous with the portions! 
Good dishes: 
- Green curry/panang curry: I find the curries are well made and have good taste, but lack a bit of imagination and you can get them at several other places! They are also a bit pricey ($16-$17) for what you get! 
- Chicken wings: These are good, but definitely not a highlight
Skip: 
- Pad Gra Prow: There's not too much to this dish, just rice, egg, either with ground pork, chicken, beef, or tofu. This feels like something you could make at home and a bit amateur, and definitely not worth the price! 
- Gai satay: I've definitely had better, and it's a bit pricey for a couple skewers.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Precilla C.,"I loveeeee Pai! It is one of my go-to Thai places in the city. 
My go to order is Gaeng Kiaw Wan, a green curry served in a coconut. They usually give you additional green curry in a bowl because the coconut is so small, but I love scraping the coconut meat and eating it with the curry. Note that if you order take out, the green curry will not come in a coconut. Their grabong (deep fried squash fritters) is also delicious and addictive!
My only complaint is that it is too popular and there are often long waits on Thursday & Fridays evenings and weekends. Get there early or be prepared for a fairly long wait!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Krystal B.,"Phenomenal. I do believe that this is one of the best Thai restaurants that I've been to. The Vegan Pad Thai was FABULOUS! They have some
Great options for vegans! Love the ambiance too. Such a vibe. Try it out!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grace Y.,"This is probably the worst service I've encountered in Toronto. I wanted to come on a public holiday, because everything else in the neighborhood was closed, and I tried calling several times but no one answered. When I arrived, the hostess gave me the worst attitude, asking, ""So do you want to wait or not?""
Beyond that, the atmosphere is incredibly dark and so noisy that you cannot possibly have a conversation.
Hipsters only.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tea M.,"I've recently discovered a newfound love for Thai food. I've been trying out some new Thai dishes from various restaurants and have thoroughly enjoyed them all but I can honestly say, none of them compare to Pai.
I would consider Pai one of my new favourite restaurants in Toronto. The food is spectacular and mouthwatering. They offer a small menu but don't let that fool you, everything is made to perfection and will leave you wanting more. My friends and I got as starters, the spring rolls and the thai chicken wings and for mains, the Thai Fried Rice. I loved the fried rice and although it may seem a simple dish for some, I felt that everything was cooked to a high level of quality and taste. My friends loved it as well and the starters were a great addition to the main! My friends preferred the chicken wings to the spring roll but they couldn't keep their hands away from their fried rice.
I couldn't even take a photo because we were all too excited to start eating but trust me, get the chicken wings and the fried rice if you're there. You won't regret it. In terms of decor, I like how Pai's underground type of vibe gives the place a more intimate and personal feel. When you come out of the restaurant, it makes it seem like you were in another world for a few hours. You get so accustomed to enjoying the dark, somber lighting with its creative art pieces strewn around that stepping out into the busy downtown streets comes as a shock. I think the best place to go to Pai to avoid the busy lineups is around 1:30-2:00pm -- we got there around this time and got a seat very fast as well as avoided a packed restaurant. 
I can't wait to bring my friends and family here and have them try this amazing restaurant. Thank you Pai for making my lunch and my friends' lunches so enjoyable!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David K.,The pai thai is the best I have ever had.  Even better than Thailand.   We loved the curry chicken and the spring rolls and the Thom Young soup all amazing.   The prices are reasonable and the the staff so helpful.  Specialty drinks also great deal and so creative.  Don't be scared off by the wait.  Line moves very fast and you won't regret waiting.  We shared food with strangers at our table that became friends before the night was over.   Can't wait to go back!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shanshan Z.,"DO NOT take your chinese parents to PAI!!!! 
I took my dad for a green curry, he said it was like spicy soup with a couple of meat that charges 17 dollars.... what can I say, PAI has changed. Taste was not as good as the last few times I was there:(",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Calvin L.,"Hands down the best Thai restaurant you can find in Toronto Imo. Everything on their menu tastes delicious and authentic. Chef Regular prides herself on using the best ingredients possible to recreate the food of her native country. Her efforts shine through in the cuisine here, as you'll be hard pressed to find a dish that doesn't leave a lasting impression. 
My favourite item here is probably the Khao Soi. It is rich in flavour with an amazing balance of savory and sweetness. The consistency always seems to be perfect as well-never too watery or oily for a broth. Combined with large tender chunks of protein (chicken or beef), this dish is an absolute winner at Pai. 
The Pad Thai here is also very good. Probably second only to the signature one at Khao San Road. I love the flavour of its tamarind sauce, but I wasn't a fan of the cabbage that came on the side. It gave the dish some texture but took away from its flavour Imo. Good thing it came on the side, so that it's optional to mix in with the noodles =) 
Last item of note is the Thai Iced Tea. Unlike most Thai restaurants that serve this drink, I found the one at Pai to be less sweet and more enjoyable as a result. Mine came with crushed ice that was refreshing to drink through the straw as well =D
Overall, you need to eat at Pai if you love Thai food! Try to make a reservation online if you can, as walk in wait times can be frustrating at this popular joint.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia T.,"I have always heard good things about this place. A friend of mine and I tried to walk in on a Friday night without a reservation, big mistake. Although, months later I finally got the chance to try it out. I went on a weekday right when it opened, and there was not much of a crowd. 
I had the 'Chef Nuit Pad Thai' with chicken. My friend had the 'Thai Fried Rice'. We loved them both. I was able to finish my pad thai considering the portion was just around the normal side (not too big, not too little). I was expecting a bigger selection on the menu. 
The environment was super casual and chill during the day. The service was a little slow, but the staff was super friendly nonetheless. 
I would definitely come back to try their desserts.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ging S.,"The line to get checked in was out the door. There's still a 20-30 minute wait after.
Attentive servers, food came out quick. Had the Pai Pad Thai and Pai sangria. The sangria consisted of lychees at the bottom, however was a little weak on the alcohol. But the pad Thai was redeeming. You get to choose from 4 different spice levels. The dish overall was flavourful and wouldn't mind a repeat.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daisy H.,"Amazing flavours. Bustling environment. Excellent service. 
My belly left happy after a great dinner and the restaurant ambience was just the cherry on top. This place is loud, dimly lit, and very trendy. The typical wait is around 15-20 minutes during peak hours though that isn't that long compared to other restaurants. 
Gai Satay ($12.50) 5 Marinated Grilled Chicken Skewers - Served with a nice peanut sauce and tangy cucumber/garlic/lime/chili sauce on the side, these skewers were such a flavourful and tender app. 
Chef Nuit Pad Thai ($15.50) - This is THE staple dish at any Thai restaurant though Pai does it well. Stuck on what to order? Get this. The rice noodles had the perfect texture and wasn't too mushy plus it had a good amount of protein in it. My only complaint is that I could've devoured a bigger plate for the price.  
Khao Pad Thamada ($14) Fried Rice w/ Egg, Green Onion, your choice of protein - So delish! The rice was so fragrant and not bland whatsoever. If you like garlic, tangy, and sweet - this is the dish for you. It's served with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili, and lime) which you can choose to drizzle on yourself. 
Tip: One main is a good size per person so don't expect to get full if you share one dish with a buddy. Their portions are just the right amount per person.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alina M.,"Came in for lunch on a Friday and the place was absolutely packed! The place was fairly busy and rather loud but the food was extremely delicious and very flavourful! Two noteworthy starters are the spring rolls and the deep fried chicken wings - both are super crispy. In terms of the level of spicyness, I'd say not to worry too much. I generally don't tolerate spice too well, and their medium is still very approachable!
Their green curry is no longer served in a coconut but it's still delicious!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Min A.,"We saw this restaurant upon our return from Byblos the night earlier and there was a line out front so we figured that it must be good and worth waiting for. We took a chance and asked our concierge to make a reservation for us which we got at 8pm, so we got lucky! When we arrived, we walked right in and were surprised by the sheer size of the location. Since we had our hotel hook us up, we were grateful since we didn't have to line up at this highly recommended place a few mins from our hotel. I asked the host when we were being seated what he recommends, and we decided to order entrees only. We ordered the Penang curry with chicken that comes with white rice and it was pretty good as could taste the kaffir lime and basil leaves. We also ordered pad gra prow, holy basil stir fry with a fried egg on top of minced chicken and it was very good. We all agreed the best dish was the pad Thai with shrimp, stir fry rice noodle with tamarind sauce, it had just the right balance of fish sauce and was absolutely delicious. Our server and the restaurant was very busy. The decor was charming as they had vintage pieces through out and vintage rock stars hung up on the walls. So glad we had a chance to try it on our long wknd trip to T-town.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Robert V.,"Time for a quick-ish lunch, but not wanting to go to the food court or underground walkways in the entertainment district? Check out Pad Northern Thai Kitchen.
Walked over from my office on University Ave. with a long-time friend, while I was Toronto for meetings.  #3 (at the time) lunch restaurant within a 10X10 block radius (may be higher now).
At the tail end of the typical lunch window (1:50pm) and the place was still bustling.
Waitress gave us a quick walkthrough of the lunch menu, and we ordered the first two things she described:
1) CHEF NUIT PAD THAI (always get the Pad Thai for the first time at a Thai restaurant) 
- stir fried rice noodles, house-made tamarind sauce, beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime, home roasted peanuts.  We chose chicken as the proteing.
2) PAD GRA PROW (northern Thai recipe)
- holy basil stir fried with your choice of ground pork, chicken, beef or tofu, steamed jasmine rice, thai style fried egg, nam prik nam pla sauce
Both were excellent, with medium spice.  Service was timely and helpful.
Win, lose or thai.....this was a win.
Will be back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lily M.,"Cannot say enough good things about this place. when we went we went with a friend who had a food allergy and they were so accommodating and were very careful to let us know if anything had peanuts in it. The service was excellent! The only downside was it took a while to get into the restaurant. This place is so popular that normal you have to wait an hour just to get seated. But if you are willing to Wait, it is for sure worth it! I would highly recommend and the story of the restaurant itself is cute as well. Throughout the restaurant there is decor that tells the story of how the restaurant got started and who the owners are. A really charming place that has really authentic food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danica C.,"I have been back to Pai for many times after the first review and it never disappoints me and my dates.  I have tried different items on the menu in each visit and they are all tasty. I love Thai spicy level and I can taste different depths of spice in each dish. 
The service and kitchen management have improved and stabilized since the grand opening. Lunch is very fast even though it is always full. The best thing is it takes reservation; therefore, it makes one of my regular lunch celebration spot with my friends and coworkers. If I didn't make reservation, I would go before noon to try to get a seat at the bar. 
Another one good thing is there are a lot of choices of food that you can share with friends. Food decor / container and placement are beautiful; they always look good in photos. :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Solomon E.,Extremely flavourful. Signature dishes are worth it. A little pricy but what isn't now days,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Calvin S.,"Khao San Road and Sukho Thai. Those were the two Thai restaurants I'm most familiar with in Downtown Toronto, and was extremely satisfied with both restaurants. I decided to try Pai, after reading reviews on Yelp and BlogTO on the fact this restaurant is on par with the two Thai restaurant kings mentioned above.
The signs outside this restaurant almost threw me off. When I saw the up arrows outside, I thought the restaurant was on the second floor! I was searching for a good 10 seconds for the stairs, but didn't manage to find any...then I saw the stairs heading down. Boy, I'm really confused now. I made sure the stairs heading down were the ones to the restaurant, and sure enough it was.
Service was slow pretty much from the point I entered the restaurant and throughout the whole time I was there. It took a good 3 minutes for me to be seated, and the restaurant wasn't exactly full when I was there. It also took a good 5 minutes for a server to come by and ask for what drink I wanted, to the point I ordered the food with the drink just to save some time.
The food came out at a decent pace though. I ordered the Chef Nuit pad thai mild, and it tasted excellent! I would say better than Khao San Road given price factor, but I still prefer Sukho Thai a bit more. The peanut ratio was actually perfect as well; I had some restaurants where they put way too much peanuts to the point it warps the taste of the pad thai itself.
I'll give it 4 stars because the food really was excellent, but if you're coming during peak hours expect to be seated at least an hour; the service here really is slow.
Free wifi! Ask for password.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anchi L.,"Everyone talks about how great Pai is, but to be honest it's really quite average. I live a few minutes walk from the restaurant and will sometimes get take out or a lunch special out of convenience. The Pad Thai is overly sweet and the flavors too overwhelming. I have been to Thailand three times and the food there does not taste this way. I'd say there are definitely better options out there that doesn't require such a crazy wait.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine R.,"This is my favourite Thai restaurant I have ever been to. Normally I get the Green Thai Curry with chicken when my friend and I visit this spot. It's our favourite to go to. Last time we went they were out of Green Curry. I decided to try something new and went with the Massaman Curry. Amazing! This place feels like its own underground world, its winds further and further under the street level. Sometimes a long wait, but worth it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nancy L.,"Food was great, though I feel like it's a bit overhyped. You can definitely find similar food for cheaper in Toronto. While the fried squash and pad thai were amazing, I found the curry just average and the portion for it a bit small.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sabina B.,"This place is worth the wait! Despite the busy weekend traffic and the 45-minute wait, I was truly impressed with the food. 
I ordered the Grabong and Gai Satay as starters and neither dish disappointed. 
I absolutely loved the Khao Soi. This dish was spectacular and felt authentically Thai. It tasted exactly like the ones I've had in Chang Mai. I was impressed. 
The decor and ambiance was very cool as well. Highly recommend.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Abdoul F.,"Pai never disappoints ;) Chicken wings, pad gra prow and shrimp fried rice are my go tos...",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Meera K.,Great Thai good!! Love the pad gra prao snd khao soi!! Comparable to my experience in Chang Mai,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ozlem K.,"This was my first time in this restaurant, atmosphere was cool, Kao Sui was just amazing, creamy coconut curry sauce, beef, egg noodles and fried noodles. Some of my colleagues have been here several times, they had fried rice and were happy with their choice. It was quite crowded during weekday lunch time, to beat the crowd try to be there as soon as they open at 11:30am. Bon appetite!!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin W.,Delicious. Best pad thai and pad see ew in Toronto,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kylie Z.,"Oh my goodness. This is one of the best thai places that I've ever tried. Food is delicious and flavourful! The presentation was executed pretty well. The wait time is quite long if you don't have reservations. 
The ambiance is dark and quite loud. Good for small gatherings. Authentic, very hip and cool place.
Food:
Grabong: freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters, red curry paste batter, sweet garlic tamarind dip, peanuts
- SO GOOD! MUST TRY!! good for sharing
Chef Nuit Pad Thai: stir fried rice noodles, house-made tamarind sauce, beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime, home roasted peanuts, choice of chicken, beef or tofu and veggies
- AH DROOLS. The flavour is just an explosion in my mouth.
Khao Soi: fresh egg noodles, golden curry, crispy noodles, coriander, green onions, choice of braised beef, chicken breast or chicken drumsticks
- Super yummy - very rich and creamy! Also filling.
Green Curry: green curry, bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, green peppers, coconut milk, choice of chicken, beef, pork, fish, or tofu and veggies, served in a coconut
- oh my, very refreshing! You can taste the freshness from the basil leaves and lime. The sauce base is light and and delicious. 
In terms of pricing, it's a bit high compared to other restaurants. It's worth it though. A must try especially if you're in the area.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edward N.,"I came here yesterday evening with some co-workers. We were a fairly large group with a reservation, so we were taken to a side room. I should note that there were quite a few people who were waiting.
The seats were pretty close to each other, so it allowed for more intimate conversation. The waiter was really nice, letting us take our time to order. 
The food took some time to come out (partially due to both how hungry we were and how large the group was), but everyone's food came out at the same time. It all looked, and tasted, delicious. The meat in the Khao Soi was tender. The soup at the end was a nice touch.
I'd definitely come again, but I'd be wise about the time, as it can get busy quickly.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stella J.,"5 stars because the food is good, the service is great and the atmosphere is lively. Pai is known for long wait times and fully booked reservations but luckily we only had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated for Sunday dinner (though we shared a table). A main dish here costs $15 minimum and it makes me want to go back to Thailand for $2 pad thai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Helen H.,"I found this place because it was most reviewed on yelp. The restaurant is located in a basement. I sat at the bar and ordered the khao soi- egg noodles in curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions and braised beef. Egg noodles are not my preferred choice, but I enjoyed the curry. There was also plenty of tender pieces of beef to be found. I can see why this restaurant is so popular.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mei L.,"Soup is good,  mild spicy and fresh lime taste,  with shrimp mushroom veggies. perfect for winter. 
However the chef Nhui pad Thai is very oily and sweet. Maybe good for some people, but personally feel too much sauce.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ash A.,Beautiful presentation. Long line ups that prove the food is incredible. Nice staff. Great location. I would come back here in a heartbeat. The curry was mouthwatering and was served in a coconut! I absolutely loved my time here. Check it out! Come for lunch or before 5:30 if you can. Lineups really do get long. Food is totally worth the wait though.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rosanna L.,"We came in for dinner a little past 8:30pm on a Thursday night without reservation - we lucked out and got a table for four relatively quickly, the line-up got pretty busy shortly after we were seated.  
Tip: Make a reservation on their website as the place gets packed!
Atmosphere: The restaurant had a cozy, marketplace feel.  Super lively.  
Service: Our server was friendly, and gave us several recommendations that we went with.  She came by to advise us before she ended her shift which was professional, and appreciated!
Food: We shared the Grabong ($14, shredded squash fritters served with a sweet garlic dip) for starter - it was interesting and I wanted to love them more because I do love my fries, but they came out a bit flaccid.  For our main, we got the Khao Soi ($16.5, fresh egg noodles in golden curry with braised beef).  We went with Medium spice level, and I don't think I would go beyond that level because it had quite the kick!  The curry was extremely flavourful and I especially loved that they topped it up with crispy noodles.  I would go back to Pai for that bowl alone!  Our second main was Pad Gra Prow ($18.5), we chose to go with the crispy pork.  It was a bit on the greasy side but that's what crispy pork is about right? ;) We also ordered the Thai iced tea ($5.5) which was a nice complement for a full Thai meal experience.  
Price: Reasonable
Overall: Will I go back? Yes!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cornelius J.,"Over 2700 reviews...clearly you're going here!! But let's chat anyway. There will be a wait unless you have a reservation, we went during mid day on Saturday and there was a line but the wait was not that bad. Most importantly you can order drinks at the bar - I got the Lowry, super refreshing!
Food (mmmm): 
For appetizers we got the Gai Satay (the peanut sauce was just right) and Northern Thai Sausage were both flavorful!!  And as great as these were the Hunglay Oxtails and Pad Gra Prow were even better!! We got a really good serving of oxtails and they were very tender. We got the ground pork pad gra prow and on first bite we were very pleased. 
You've read in other reviews that the service can be slow but everyone was so nice and helpful with explaining the menu and providing favorites. In all this big and busy place serves up some great comfort food and I would definitely go back. Enjoy!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christopher B.,"We came here for lunch excited to see what it was all about. I didn't foresee it being downstairs with a lively, somewhat loud, atmosphere. 
After the initial orders and having our food served I felt we were sort of an after thought and forgotten about. It may have been a shift change but that is really no excuse. 
The food itself was good but nothing super. The papaya salad was tasty but not quite spiced up to the level I expected. The panang curry had good flavor and probably a dish I'd order again.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy Z.,"So much yums in one meal! 
He took me here when he heard I've never been because apparently it's one of the gems in the city, & to be honest, I've never been to a thai restaurant.. I know, I know.. shocker! 
The place is underground and it's cute as hell. Decor reminds me of going away to thailand or some exotic place. Dim lights, romantic setting.. it was perf. Definitely a perfect place to bring your ladies, gentlemen! We didn't make a reservation (oops lol) and we ended up having to wait an hour but it didn't matter because we just walked around the area.. I'd say it was worth the wait! They text you when your table is ready and you have 5 minutes, so don't walk away too fast. 
They have options that can be made vegan, which he made sure for me before he picked the place. So awesome. I had the green curry vegan dish (tofu/veggies) and it was served inside a young coconut, which I loved. The aesthetic was real. With the jasmine rice, it was perf. He had some other rice dish.. honestly I can't recall because I was so fixated on my own deal. It had a fried egg on it though.. and he finished it all, so clearly it was good. Huge portions! 
Service was quick and friendly, which is always appreciated.
Pai, you are the apple of my eye.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ken C.,"I came here during lunch hour on a weekday and it quickly filled up within 30 minutes. By the time I left there was a queue waiting for seats. Service is excellent and quick. Atmosphere is busy.
For my dish I chose Green Curry again. I believe the level of spice is predetermined now whereas in the past you were allowed to choose your level. As such it's not as spicy, but still has a good kick. The coconut taste blends well. There is a healthy portion of eggplant.The portion is great -- the steamed rice soaks in the curry sauce very well. You could almost have another bowl of rice to indulge yourself.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diana S.,"THE restaurant you need to visit when in downtown Toronto -- Pai is basically a landmark here, must see, must do/eat. It's as much about the experience here as about the food. Don't be intimidated by the subtle exterior; with just a modest ""PAI"" sign it can be tricky to find. But inside is a much different kind of experience -- music is modern and pretty loud, makes the restaurant feel more casual and a bit club-like, so not the best place to come with families or children. The staff are very attentive and down to earth despite how crazy busy they are. Be prepared for a wait if you try to come during peak hours (11am-1pm lunchtime and 6pm onward). Depending on how many people in your party the wait can be up to an hour. With 1-2 people the wait is generally within 30 minutes. The restaurant is large, but it is so packed. There are shared common tables, individual tables, and bar seating. Bar seating is a great option for 1-3 people!
The food. Actually, if you're simply coming for the food, I'd recommend checking out Sukhothai, which is owned by the same people (?) but is somewhat less busy (usually no wait). The food options and quality are pretty much the same. Must-order mains are the khao soi (try it with the braised beef, sooo tender and well seasoned), green curry, pad Thai, and pad gra pow. I very strongly recommend the khao soi -- you will want to chug the entire bowl of curry broth. I've also ordered the ox tail here before on their dinner menu. In conclusion the red meats are very well made here. For appetizers I strongly recommend the squash fritters, but unfortunately those are only available at dinner time. For lunch today we tried the papaya salad. The papaya salad itself was well made, retained the fresh papaya taste without hints of added sugar (I hate that) and was made more interesting with the addition of green beans, dried shrimp, and tomatoes. It's definitely for sharing as it's a huge plate that also comes with shrimp chips and rice noodles, etc. 
In the past I've tried their desserts -- not sure if the coconut based ice cream was seasonal, but it was my favourite. Came with many interesting toppings and was so dense. The mango sticky rice was also noteworthy, but nothing extraordinary.
Overall, Pai is my favourite Thai place in town. Not the most authentic or healthy, but definitely a place to indulge in good food and good company.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laur F.,"I've been here a few times. It's my favourite Thai restaurant.  I've enjoyed everything I've ordered (I've tried most items on the menu).  
Sometimes, there's a long wait to get a table here. It's best to make a reservation when possible.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nada S.,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE did I mention LOOOOOOOOOVE this place!! So good I drive here all the way from mississauga. 
They have an amazing Pad Thai that can also be made vegan which is not as easy as you may think (for it to still taste good that is!) 
Everything I've had here was amazing, spring rolls, pad Thai, dessert, green curry just TRY EVERYTHING! 
They are packed on weekends and do not take reservations :( which is my only issue here. But then again the place isn't very big so I understand. 
The vibe of the inside is super cool too, looks like the streets of a Thai market. 
I also found out they even have a private room you can book for events and large groups. 
If you haven't been here yet and are contemplating it, stop thinking! JUST GO! You won't regret it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Merari B.,"The food was really good! 
I got the Vegetarian dish and it was really good
The sangria here is AMAZINGGGG you deff have to try that out",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gaby D.,"I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Toronto. Great atmosphere and fantastic food! We got there right at the restaurant opened at 3 pm and it was already packed, and now we can see why. The appetizers were excellent, we got the spring rolls and the grabong. The service was quick and everyone that attended us was extremely nice. For our entrees we got the pad Thai, khao soi, green curry, and Tom yum soup. To be honest, the green curry was not my favorite but other people in the restaurant seem to enjoy it. My personal favorite was the Pad Thai. All the other dishes were exceptional as well and next time I come to Toronto I will definitely be back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily L.,"This is one of the best Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto! I've been here twice and both times were on a weekend. I would make a reservation if possible but it seems like their reservations are usually full except for a few odd times like in between lunch and dinner or really late at night. I only had to wait 15 minutes for the one time I went on a Sunday for dinner. The decor in the restaurant is super cute - it's a great spot for dates! To top it off, the customer service is really good!
As for the food, I've tried the pad Thai, the squash fritters (it's on the menu with a Thai name that I don't remember, but there's English descriptions under each food item), khao soi, chicken wings, Thai milk tea, and non-alcoholic ginger beer. My favourite dish was the squash fritters! I highly recommend - it's one of their most popular dishes. They give quite a bit so it might be a little too much for two people. The chicken wings come with a Thai sauce that is the same as the ones they give for the fritters so I wouldn't recommend getting that sauce with the wings if you also order the fritters. The dish comes with three wings, but you have the option to add a fourth if you're sharing. The Thai milk tea here is my favourite. They use crushed ice and the flavour is amazing! Also for those who are environmentally friendly, you'll be happy to know that they don't serve the drink with any straws (they were using paper straws but they've taken that out since the first time I visited the restaurant).
Love this restaurant - you definitely have to go this place a try! And it probably won't just be your first and last time there!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eddy C.,"There is no service at this restaurant.
Okay, to be fair, there is very scant service. When I reviewed the many reviews on this restaurant, majority of complaints were about the lack of service. 
How sad that the owner(s) doesn't get this right.
They've got a great thing going on here.
Unfortunately, if the management doesn't realize why the cheese cake factory spends millions of dollars on employee training, this restaurants future is doomed.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cassandra R.,Everything is good - some of my favourite Thai food in the city! Love their pad gra prow,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Viv V.,"Pai is definitely worth the hype, a must try!!
After several friends recommended this restaurant we finally decided to make the trip downtown to try it, and here's my review of Pai:
Mains and Apps: 5*: 
Golden curry dish with fresh and fried egg noodle was delicious.  The curry flavour was unique and flavourfull.  Came with around 6 to 8 shrimps which was generous in my opinion.
Green curry chicken in young coconut dish was delish.  Especially scraping off the meat inside the coconut and mixing it with the curry.  Comes with rice, and if the curry doesn't all fit into the coconut they will give you a seperate bowl for the rest.
Thai Chicken wings was also very nicely marinated, crispy, and juicy.  $5.50 for only 3 wings (not whole wing, the winglette part only) is a bit pricey though, I think it should come standard with 4 pieces, had to pay $2 ectra for 1 more wing.
Drinks 5*: Thai Iced Tea was great and came in a large sized cup with ice.
Dessert 5*: Mango Sticky Rice: myst tey dessert!  Comes with 2 big pieces of mango and the rice was yummy.
Place 5*: not fancy but a great casual atmosphere.  Makes you feel like you are in Thailand, well done with the decor.
Service 4*: only complaint is that food orders came out quite slow.  Apoetizee and drink came almost instantly but main dishes took 30+ mins.  We also ordered a Pad Thai for takeout and for some reason, that came early while the food we were eating there took much longer.  Also be prepared to wait for seating, quite a line up even at 4pm on a Saturday.
Overall, would love to come back and try more dishes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hyemi L.,"Came here with high expectations after hearing many recommendations from friends but left slightly disappointed.
Wait time was about 20 minutes before we got seated which was expected on a weekend night. What really blew us off was the service - after being sat down in a corner seat, we had servers walk by us more than TEN times over the course of 25 minutes, to which all of them decided to ignore us even with us waving them down. We were seated for 35 minutes and did not receive a single acknowledgement from any server - I had to get out of my seat, walk to the front desk and ask for a server to come and take our order. 
Although this whole ordeal left us with a bad taste in our mouths, the food was great. I tried the thai fried rice with beef - although not the best I've had, definitely still up there. The thai iced tea was amazing, very authentic yet not too sweet.
Would revisit solely for the food. Hopefully the service is better next time around!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arshaan B.,The Pad Thai turned out great even though I got it delivered. It also goes well with the Thai Iced Coffee.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anjelica P.,"Believe the hype: the food was so good.
My husband and I were in town for vacation and were told about this spot for their food and chill environment.
There was a pretty long line when we arrived on a Sunday evening for dinner. We waited about 15 minutes before a table was available. We ended up opting for community seating which was quicker.
The vibe was fun and cool, aside from the very loud talkers beside us. But that's no fault on Pai!
We wanted to start with their shrimp chips, but they were sold out. So our server suggested the Kung Tawt (tiger shrimp) which was solid.
For our main dishes, my husband ordered the Pad Gra Prow with shrimp while I ordered the fried fish. Both dishes were prepared well, and the flavors were so good. The sauce that came with the fried fish was also very yummy!
It was a great experience and I would gladly come back whenever we're back in town!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sharona F.,"Always crazy busy but food and atmosphere lively, inviting and friendly. Fresh,tasty and reliable classic Thai dishes. Apps excellent for sharing.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clara C.,"Pai is so highly rated and I can understand why! I've only been here maybe 2-3 times and it's always so busy every time. My favourite dish from here is the panang curry chicken. Even though it's very busy, the service is still pretty good. I would love coming back to Pai, even with the long wait, because the food is just so delicious!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erin B.,I have absolutely no complaints about the food here. The Tom yum soup was made with tomatoes and herbs from God's garden. That was hands down the best bowl of Tom yum I ever ate. The thai restaurants I've been to in the states make the broth watery. This broth was rich and flavorful. I also ordered the oxtails that were magically delicious.  They were so tender and flavorful. I need to find my way back to Toronto JUST so I can eat here again. Even if I don't do anything else but eat here I'd be satisfied.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Abdul E.,"Upon entry, it's obvious the restaurant is constantly busy with a warm, cozy, and inviting atmosphere. We were lucky to be seated immediately and drinks were brought promptly. The server was attentive, welcoming, and informative. For appetizers, we ordered the grabong, or squash fritters with a sweet tangy dipping sauce. It was delicious, with a light crispy texture and flavor. We ordered a large portion of the tom yum which came with a nice pouch of rice wrapped in a bamboo leaf. The panang curry was creamy and had a nice kick with a side of bamboo wrapped rice, and the pad thai was full of flavor. The khao soi had an amazing curry sauce that complemented the noodles nicely. The pad gra prow with beef is delicious as well; the beef was well seasoned and the over easy egg complemented the dish nicely. Portions were a good size. Overall one of the best Thai places I've ever experienced. Highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lily C.,"This is one of my favourite places for Thai food in Toronto. In terms of authenticity I say it's a bit over commercialized since I've been to Thailand and if having to compare I can't say it's authentic. It's definitely really tasty and it's always packed, I like the consistency of the restaurant.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelly Z.,"Really frackin' good. 
I went on a weekend in the afternoon, and there was tons of space for me and my two friends. The server was attentive and friendly and the atmosphere was really chill.  
I had the Khao Soi and it was a thick curry with perfectly cooked noodles. Very filling and delicious. I asked for medium spiciness and that was a very good level of spice to warm you up without burning your tongue. My friend got the Pad Thai with the most extreme spiciness; I took one bite and my mouth was on fire for a good five minutes, with lingering sensations for another twenty minutes! I tried my other friend's Masaman Curry and it was very fragrant and yummy, I don't think you can really go wrong at this restaurant!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley N.,"The food here was absolutely amazing!!! BUT the wait was terrible, unsure if it'd be worth going again. 
My boyfriend and I got there on the early-ish (around 4:30 I think) and we only waiting about 5-10 minutes to be seated. However the wait between which we ordered our food (around 4:45) and when our first plate reached our table (around 5:50) was EXCRUCIATING. It felt like everyone around us, even those who were seated after us, were getting their food first. 
We ordered two apps and two entrees because that's how hungry we were, we had to keep each other entertained while we waited which was really difficult because were some of the hangriest people you'll probably ever meet. 
It might've been from how hungry we were, but the food tasted absolutely amazing. 
Might come back with a good excuse!
*edit*
I was writing the draft back a few months ago, and just recently came back with my boyfriend to meet our friend. The wait was not as bad, about 20 minutes. The portion sizes seem to have gotten smaller, but it's still equally as loud and dark inside. It makes it hard for the servers to see you when you want to order or to ask for more water or the cheque.
Still loved this place regardless, kind of want to try sitting on the floor mats one day.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sam M.,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner. The food was so amazing, however the service was a bit slow. This place is crazy busy, so try to come early to avoid the rush. We got here at 5pm and were able to get seated very quickly, however it did take a while for the waitress to come around and collect our drink and food orders and for the food and drinks to come out. When we were leaving there was a huge lineup going outside of the door.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ava R.,"Just tried this place via Uber eats for the first time. The ""best of Toronto"" label tells the truth - this was some damn good pad Thai. I tried it mild and it tasted like no spice, so next time I will try medium spice for a bit more of a kick. 
I got it with chicken and it was very succulent and juicy.  Warning - The pad Thai is more of a brown colour with a pile of some sort of slaw on top which is off-putting when I opened the take out container. But it was very delicious, I would get it again in a heartbeat!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wahine M.,"Easy take out service and was the best Thai I've had in a long time. So happy that I found this place on my visit to Toronto. 
They are super busy, so order ahead and even then you may still have to wait in the back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sunny V.,"East meet West. Perfect for joint for Hipsters. The food is not the greatest. It does fool alot of people. Its pretty loud in there. If you on a date and don't like to talk not a bad place to be. If you want to have a good conversation. Make sure you are good with sign language. 
Price for the food is ok not bad. Service can be better but you get what you paid for. Wash down Thai food perfect for Canadians.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nance L.,"Had dinner here tonight and the place was packed. We ordered the Thai chicken wings, pad Thai, oxtail, & ground chicken over rice. Food & service was excellent. We were seated at a table where you have to remove your shoes. Almost like sitting on the ground and it would have been cool if we were younger. Food was tasty, but you don't get a lot for what you pay. Definitely a place for anyone to try but not a repeater for us if ever in Toronto again.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raymond D.,A shame because this popular spot seems great. But they're always out of half of the already restrictive lunch menu. The few things they have available are good but again lunch is really restrictive and they run out quickly of the popular items.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yukie C.,"Worth the hype! Finally got to try this place today! Friend warned me that the wait is always long but today we only waited 20 min for a group of 6.
I got the chicken pad Thai with Thai ice tea and it was some of the best Thai food ever. I loveeeeee the Thai iced tea! It's so creamy and has a very nice tea flavour, prolly the best I've had. The pad Thai was super flavourful and noodles were perfect. I also tried my friends pad gra prow and it was just as yummy.
Service started off slow but picked up near the end. I really enjoyed the experience here and it is def worth all the hype.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James T.,"Got the chicken pad Thai and spring rolls to go. Nothing special here, didn't particularly care for the spring rolls which were a bit over done. The inside of the restaurant looked cool and was busy, but the food definitely didn't deliver like I was expecting from the high Yelp rating.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sohyun K.,"I came here with my boyfriend because of the good reviews. We both love Thai food, so we were so excited to try Pai! We didn't have a reservation and we came here during lunchtime, so we had to wait a little but it was expected.
We ordered the Sai Ua Platter (Northern Thai Sausage) as an appetizer for the both of us. It was delicious, but the portion was so tiny... It was like they took 1 tiny sausage and cut it up into small pieces. I really expected there to be more for $14... kind of wish we didn't get it at all. 
For our main, we shared the Gaeng Panang Curry just because we wanted to have some room for dessert later on at a different place. The curry was delicious! We asked for extra spice, so they gave us a little bowl of chilis to put in the curry. They really pack a punch! The curry was smooth and one of a kind. Never had a curry that was quite that good. 
Overall, I would come here again to try more curries and mains but I think I'll stay away from the appetizers.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,SimsimmaCriti C.,"No one eats more than I do. Seriously.
I am a fat, fat man, in a little man's body. All I do is eat, then walk to the next restaurant to burn off a couple calories to eat again. I've eaten all over this great city but only started writing reviews now because the Ball & Chain's sister got invited to Yelp Elite and she can't even boil water and only eats where I tell her, so here we go:
Best Thai in the city. End of.
Used to be khao san, but pai is now the captain now.
Better than the more hipster Sabai Sabai and the rest of them.
The Khao Soi is heavy af and you might need unbuckle your belt, but it's so worth it",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jordan B.,"Ordered take out from Pai: 
Spring rolls - big fat crunchy rolls amazing flavour.
Green curry - super well spiced complex flavour.
Tom Yum soup- well spiced broth.
Pad Thai - perfect!
I loved that you could pick your spice level. We went with Thai spicy level and be warned it's no joke!  
Would order from here again. I really want to try the sausage. Yum!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steven S.,"Dinner at Pai was a good experience with good food. I'd recommend going here for dinner with a friend who likes to socialize.
The food was very good, especially for the price. I had a Thai tea, the squash fritters, and the Khao Soi. All were good. The fritters was an enormous portion but not too filling, good for sharing with the table. The curry was tasty but a bit boring. 
The service was good. We sat at the bar, and were impressed by how much attention the bartender paid. He even took the time to join our conversation (and we welcomed him) on a busy Saturday night. I was also very impressed by how quickly the food came out. 
The restaurant is a little dark, and feels divey. Somewhat Asian, informal decorations crowd the walls. It was packed on a Saturday night. Thankfully, we didn't wait at all once we talked to the host, because the place seats so many people. 
Overall, we enjoyed Pai. I'd recommend going here for dinner with a friend who likes to socialize.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda F.,Hands down best Thai food I've ever had! Delicious from start to finish. I knocked a star because the service was pretty underwhelming. The waitress would just sit around while we were waiting on her to come take our orders and needed napkins etc.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Keecs F.,"So, when I hear Thai I think noodles; Far from it. There was noodles but there was soooo much more. I had one of the best fries fish and the stickiest of sticky rice. Service was excellent. Oxtail and noodles were great as well",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Camila Z.,Didn't like it...all food taste too sweet. Even the meat! I don't believe thai food needs to be like this,2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jamie H.,"This was my second time at Pai. While we originally wanted to sit down but there were no seats available and the wait was extremely long. So, we did takeout!
I ordered the Pad Cha Hett which is a vegan stir-fry containing mushrooms, snow peas, chili paste, and other Thai spices. It was served on a bed of rice. It was extremely delicious with the perfect amount of spice (mind you, I like my food pretty spicy). However, considering the ingredients used, I found it a bit pricey and the person taking our order was quite rude but that's to be expected from a popular and hip restaurant in Toronto. 
I would definitely recommend this place to others. The restaurant has a great fun, young, hipster vibe to it and it's relatively affordable. Will definitely come again and again!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria S.,"Worth the wait! There is always a line up to eat at Pai but I have been meaning to try it out for a while. I ordered the Khao Soi and was not disappointed! The curry was very flavourful and perfect with the egg noodles. My braised beef was a bit tough but they give lots of meat. The price of Pai is amazing for the delicious food. Additionally, the Thai tea was also really delicious. I feel it is difficult to find a good Thai tea around this area but Pai does it well. 
The service was great despite it being super busy and the atmosphere was live. I would definitely recommend you to try this place, and I will be going back in the future.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie C.,"Went here for lunch and found it packed! The waiter was surprised we were from out of town so I assume it is a well-known popular local place. Small menu for lunch but the waiter had good recommendations. We tried the wings as an appetizer and I had the Crispy pork holy basil. My colleague had the green curry which she raved about. I ordered the crispy pork farang or foreigner spicy, one step below Thai spicy which had a bite to it. 
While we waited for our food prior we were complimenting Pai about its decor of old albums from the 80s and underground rock feel. I even saw a back room I assume designated for private parties. 
Would recommend to anyone! Definitely would return",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Quinn M.,The best Thai food and mocktails I have ever had. Ordered the shared sampling platter and could not have been more pleased. A little bit of every taste profile you could ask for from spicy sausage to sweet and crunchy sweet potato fry like beignets.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alan P.,The food is generally fairly consistent. But with the vast amount of great Thai food in the city. I would rate the food here 4 stars!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel A.,"Needed to give an update! This place has definitely proven itself worthy of 4.5 stars in my last few visits. I find waiting in line to put your name down is actually longer than the wait for the table. This place is always busy so be mindful of that if trying to make a plan after. I loved their cocktails, and they also have 5 dollar daily shots. The grabong, pad thai and khao soi are my go-tos, however I have had the massaman curry and this is also very delicious. What I do find is the spice levels are not what they used to be. It lacks that kick that I felt the very first time I came here. Regardless, everything is very tasty, and although it can be a bit pricy after ordering a few dishes, it's a great place and has an awesome atmosphere for a night out.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,The FoodBoss ..,You gotta check this downtown toronto restaurant. Very authentic and great ambiance! Friendly staff and food service. We had the PAD GRA PROW with crispy pork and Thai fried rice it was phenomenal. Some of the best fried rice I've had you literally taste char from the wok on the rice amazing flavors! 100% recommend!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt J.,"Amazing fresh Thai food with vegetarian options! Must say, the Pad Thai was great! Usually need a reservation but this time we were lucky and walked right in. Tons of things can be made vegetarian or vegan and lots of creative drinks! Glad we made it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thomas V.,"Foodwise, this place brought me back to Thailand. Easily the best Thai food I've had since dining in Chiang Mai and Bangkok. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu but the Khoa Soi and Pad Thai were standouts.  Ambiance is cool but a very loud restaurant so don't expect a quiet atmosphere.  Can be a long wait but 100% worth trying as it'll be one of the best culinary experiences of your life. 
Chicken Pad Thai (Thai spicy): 5/5
Khoa Soi: 5/5
Spring Rolls: 5/5
Mango Sticky Rice: 4/5
The Lowry (drink special): 3/5",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nadia A.,"I went there for lunch.  I ordered the shrimp for stater, it was excellent.  For the main course I order chicken pad Thai & beef green curry.  The food were delicious",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David C.,"Come to Pai to try authentic Thai!!! Ok, but on a less lighter note, Pai lived up to its hype as the food was superb. 
We went to pai on a Sat night, and upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised by its vibrant, busy and lively atmosphere. 
 
We tried Thai tea for the first time. It was a lightly flavored black tea that had a hint of cream making it slightly sweet and refreshing.
We ordered 3 different dishes to try. 
1) Miang Kung 
        An interesting dish that required us to make our own wrap with different ingredients (mentioned in the menu). There was an example of how to make the wrap. Combining all of the ingredient on the betel leaf created a balanced explosion of zesty, tangy, spicy, and savory flavors 
2) Chef Nuit Pad Thai (with chicken)
         Signature dish that lived up to its expectations. Best Pad Thai I have ever tasted. 
3) Khao Soi (with braised beef)
         It was a great light and sweet curry. However I would suggest not drinking too much of the curry soup. 
We would definitely come back with a larger appetite to try other items on the menu.
Tip: Make a reservation",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joanne C.,"Ordered from this restaurant for takeout. The pad thai was excellent, packed with vegetables and tofu, and very spicy. The khao soi is a must order, full of flavour, and has a lot of vegetables and tofu. Both dishes were very rich, and lasted me about 3 days. The dishes were packed carefully for take our",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elisa L.,"Got Khao Soi as well as Pad Gra Prow this time around. Both dishes were good. Also got the Plum Mule drink which was pretty decent. The serving speed was reasonable given that it was pretty busy. They forgot to refill our water after being reminded several times though. 
The food is decent (minus the horrid Pad Thai, don't get it). Good vibes and ambience for both small and larger groups. Expect a wait if no reservations (20 to 30m for lunch), they text you when your table is ready. 
There's a food court style Pai Market towards the back with a more limited menu but no wait required.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susie C.,"I finally returned to this place after a one year hiatus - I've never had enough time to wait. On a Friday night, I waited 1.5 hours for a table for 2. Luckily, I live around the corner so I went home to get ready while waiting. 
The atmosphere and food was better than I remembered it - it's clearly gained more popularity. I was craving some Pad See Ew, but they don't that so I opted for the Pad Thai (unoriginal I know). I forgot their spicy scale is so different from Khao San's so I went for the ""foreigner's spicy"" - one level below Thai spicy and...IT WASN'T SPICY AT ALL. Either that, or they forgot to put any spiciness in my dish. 
That was a bummer, but everything else was great. It's pretty loud so I felt like I lost half my voice after my dinner. That was probably also because it took almost an hour for our food to arrive (they must have been extra busy that night).",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cathy S.,"so far, all the things i have ordered tasted very good! It is always pack. thats the only issue.  
service was great even tho the restaurant is packed.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ernest T.,"PAI honestly has all the qualities of a good restaurant - great food, good atmosphere and friendly service. The prices are fair for what it is. This is definitely a restaurant that I will keep on going back to.
I've been here multiple times and have tried a couple things here and all are great:
Gaeng Masaman with Braised Beef - a tamarind curry with braised beef and served with Jasmine Rice. Beef is very soft and tender; the curry is sweet with a small kick of spice and a slightly-more-than-subtle hint of peanut, overall very balanced; and rice is rice. The potatoes served in the curry are shaped in medium-sized spheres and are firm upon grasp but soft when you bite into them. Both the beef and potatoes have been cooked in the curry enough that there is that second layer of flavour to it. 
Khao Pad Thamada - a fried rice with your choice of chicken/beef/tofu or veggies. I've had both the chicken and beef and they were both good but nothing exceptional. I think what really helps take the dish to the next level is the chili oil that it comes with. The chili oil adds a medium kick of spice, subtle garlic flavour and a nice aroma to the rice. Probably some of the best fried rice I've ever had
Chicken Skewers - a bit expensive (I think it was $15 for 5 skewers) and the skewers weren't huge, but they still tasted great. Chicken was perfectly cooked, and were very tender upon biting them. The peanut-based sauce that it came up with made it even better.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linda L.,"Top notch flavor. Really seriously delicious pad thai and khao soi. I come here all the time for takeout.
But don't even bother trying to get a seat cuz you'll be waiting for an hour on a normal weeknight.
Inside, it's really well decorated and lively. But also SUPER LOUD, so not suited for intimate conversations or catchups with old friends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sab Q.,"Ambiance: would be the best hang out choice to start up the morning or end the evening... 
Service: very fast and consistent
Price: lower average price
Food: close to authentic thai. Tasty! 
Others: not sure if it's because it's like underground, but my nose is super sensitive... I can smell the sewage after sitting there for 20mins... And that somehow turned off my appetite... Even with all the flavours and spice, the sewage was still bothering me and not my buddies... I won't for sure be eating there after smelling the sewage",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Will V.,"Pai is by far the best Thai restaurant in Toronto, everything I've tried from the menu has been delicious and I've never been disappointed yet!
My favourite items is the Khao Soi, which has amazing flavours (from the golden curry) and topped with crispy noodles served on fresh egg noodles. Their Green Curry tastes delicious and is served in a coconut when you dine in. the Pai Thai also tastes delicious and doesn't have an overpowering sauce like other places. My friends love the Gaeng Masaman and always orders that when they eat here. Lastly, my favourite item of them all is their Thai Iced Tea drink, it's a must try as its not super sweet, one sip and you are hooked.
The restaurant is always busy during lunch and dinner and can get pretty loud, its best to try and make a reservation/call ahead otherwise you'll be waiting for 30 mins or more.
Definitely a must try place if you love Thai food, the food here has high quality ingredients and is delicious. You won't be disappointed!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Silas N.,"Pai is one of my most recommended places to go to in Toronto. Not just the best Thai food but for anyone looking for solid, amazing food. You will not be disappointed.
I have probably tried over 70% of the menu and it all tastes great. Recently have ordered takeout delivery for Pad Gra Prow and when I got it, the egg was still runny. That's the kind of detail you're getting as most places would've had an overcooked egg by the time it got to me.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Johnny L.,"Food is really good, I can't think of a better Thai restaurant in Toronto. Very reasonable prices.
I've been here a couple of times and the service however has never been amazing, and the last time it was pretty poor. We were seated maybe an hour before closing and had one of the worst experiences with a server at any restaurant. Rude and water was never filled even though it wasn't too busy at the time. The table next to us was asked if they wanted anything before the kitchen closed but the server simply walked by our table, as if we'd done something to upset her.
Really disappointed as the food is great but this experience has given me mixed feelings.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Evangeline P.,"Fantastic menu and a great service experience.  I was a fan of Kiin and Chef Nui's other Pai.  This past weekend we visited the uptown location for the first time.  Service was excellent and the menu included some authentic, not typically found, items.  Not a disappointing bite was had.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wes B.,"Thai food that's so tasty! 
Got the pad Thai twice. Had the opportunity to come twice in two weeks for a work trip and this stop is what I was excited about most in between the two. 
Looking forward to coming back to Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny H.,"Pai has one of the best and most delicious pad Thai I've ever had. SOOOO GOOD!! I got the chef Nuit paid Thai with chicken, and it was absolutely delicious with medium level spice (I believe there are 5 levels to choose from). The kick of spice, tang in the tamarind sauce, and portion size were all perfect. It's a bit pricer ($15.50 not incl tax) than other pad Thai dishes around the area, but the quality and taste definitely make up for it! 
 It was very busy when we got here (around 8pm) but thankfully there were still seats at the bar. Staff were very friendly and asked us about how we were finding our food, and the food came out quite quickly as well. I love Pai! Definitely want to try out the other dishes next time I come here, which will hopefully be soon! Highly recommend!! The hype is worth it :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sunny G.,"Dont be intimated by the long line outside. It moves relatively fast. The food is worth the wait if you're willing to hang in there. We got very lucky and got to sit down traditional style with our shoes off for our dining. We ordered the chicken wings with the tamarind sauce with the chicken penang curry with fried rice followed by the thai peanut ice cream. 
Very thrilled with our experience here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dilys C.,"This place was super busy when we arrived. We didn't reserve beforehand and luckily for a table for 2 the wait was only about 25 minutes. 
The music is loud here and it has dimmed lighting, kind of give off a bar atmosphere. 
We ordered the squash fritters, green curry with beef (medium spice), and khao soi with chicken breast.
The squash fritters was very good. You can taste the squash since it's not over battered and is fried nicely. The dip that comes with the fritters gives it a sweet and spicy flavour and the large portion size is perfect for sharing. 
The green curry with beef came in a coconut filled with lots of veggies and beef. Then extra curry came on the side. The curry comes with rice and I would have to say this dish was just ok. It was creamy and had enough spice but it lacked flavour. 
The dish that stood out the most was the khao soi with chicken breast. It was very creamy and the combination of spicy, sweet, and savoury totally gave a umami taste to this dish. The noodles are great and the khao soi came with garnishes on the side which it didn't really need because it was already very good on its own. However I would have to say chicken breast is not the best choice for this because the chicken came out to be kind of dry. 
I would come back for their takeout service since it is quite busy and also the loud music makes it hard to converse with my party.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bradley H.,"Sweet baby Jesus!!! This is the best Thai food i have ever tried in my whole life. First off the entrance is down some stairs when you first walk in so do trip :). My gf and I came in for lunch the other day and ordered the Tom yum soup (best we have ever tried), the green curry w shrimp in a coconut (to die for), and some of the vegetarian spring rolls (love them). I wish we had more time to explore the rest of the menu during our short trip to Toronto. We will def stop by the next time we are in the area! Might stop by on our way out of the city as we drive back to DC.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicholas M.,"Incredible food, fun environment. Drinks were decent but not amazing. The food was absolutely delicious, best Thai food I've had.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Priya K.,"SO GOOD!!!!
I'm not a fan of Thai food because I've never had good Thai food until I tried Pai. Such good food, although portions are small, we ordered two plates for lunch and it just filled us up. Would definitely recommend to check out for a nice (non bloating) meal 
The ambiance is super authentic to Thailand, only concern was that the tables were toooo close to each other, more of a lunch room vibe than restaurant when it came to seating. 
Worth my money though, will be visiting again",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karian L.,"Great restaurant with unique tasty food. I'm always for the hunt for something different, and by now, pad thai etc is normal fair to me. 
Enter Pai, with their unique (to me) fare. We ordered several appetizers to share and one main. 
Miang Kung- different ingredients that you put together in betel leaves.  Very tasty and light with the right amount of spice. Everything works well together (shrimp and pomelo, what???)
Som Tum Tad- green papaya saladwith salted crab. To be honest, I just wanted to see what a salted crab was. I think if you're not Asian or are not used to ""different"" foods you would not enjoy this much. But then why would you come here, right? Interesting, and again had the right level of taste, but I wouldn't get it again
Plah Nua - beef salad. GET IT CUZ IT'S SO SO GOOD. I don't even like mint leaves and I gobbled this up. Beef cooked to perfect level for this dish and lots of it, more than I expected. 
Khao Soi - egg noodles in coconut curry with chicken drumsticks. Order an extra bowl of rice so that delicious delicious curry doesn't go to waste. Or take it home and enjoy the next day. 
Thai iced tea - nice size, a little bit sweeter than I like it but I let the ice melt a bit and it was fine after that. 
Prices are very decent in comparison to other Thai restaurants. The ratio of actual food to sauce is higher than normal which is a big win for me since I hate going to places that use filler vegetables (green peppers) and little meat in their dishes. You can tell that a lot of thought and care went into preparing the planning of their menu. 
I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to try other items!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ahmed A.,Very nice clean Thi food ... i liked the rice with chicken and fried eggs on the top ... the Fried shrimp was very nice too. Sorry didnt take pic for the food .. was so hungry this time.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria N.,Everything here tastes amazing and the staff is really friendly. Pai is my new favourite restaurant on MealPal. I've yet to try a dish I don't love.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nathan W.,Very good experience. The food is authentic Thai tasting with a slight twist of the chef's innovation for extra flavors. The morning glory vegetable is one of the highlights of this place. It's a traditional Thai vegetable cooked in amazing sauce. Only real Thai restaurants serve this dish.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Faith G.,"Love this restaurant! Amazing delicious food and excellent service everytime! The only thing is it gets very crowded (prepandemic), and the music gets very loud. I felt so claustrophobic that I had to go outside for some air. Maybe it'll be different now, I haven't gone back yet since reopening of restaurant. 
But it's still one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexis F.,"This place is POPPIN. I wouldn't say for a certain reason, per say, but we waited 2 hours for a table... The location is nice and the aesthetic of the place is satisfying. I enjoyed the food a lot but some of my friends didn't enjoy it too too much (some can be picky). The night that we went it was obvi very busy so our waiter wasn't very attentive but I was in an understanding mood at the time. Overall food was a 4, location and environment were a 5, and experience was a 3.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angel S.,"Came here to check out the hype from social media.
The restaurant was surprisingly not jam-packed and we came around thirty minutes after 12 on a Saturday.  We were seated at the stools instead of the traditional seating at the back as that table could only seat up to 4 people (we had 6 people). 
I ordered the Pad Grow with crispy pork, as its one of their featured dish. Tasted similar to the Taiwanese minced pork rice. The difference is the egg is not boiled but pan fried. Since I got the mild version, the flavour was okay. It wasn't bland but it lacked a bit of flavour too. Will try the spicier version next time.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tia T.,"Hands down my favourite Thai place!!! Be prepared to line up if you don't come early for dinner! This place can be packed!! Service is decent and at a good pace for a place this busy. It can be a bit on the noisier side so if you are bringing a date and one of you is quiet, it might be a little harder to hear. 
I really enjoy their beef brisket khao soi and their pad Thai is really good too! Friends have also enjoyed their papaya salad and their chicken wings.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cory H.,"Although the establishments atmosphere was exactly as reflected within the reviews, I must say that the positive correlation did not extend to the food.  From a presentation perspective, the staff was extremely courteous and attentive to our needs.  The food was plated with care; nonetheless, the flavor profile left much to the imagination.  We found the food bland, which is contradictory to the cuisine.  We ordered the PAD THAI (Chicken) and PAD GRA PROW (Pork) as our main dish with Thai Chicken wings and GRABONG as our appetizers (which were not bad).  We are from the US so our palate may be more accustomed to robust flavors; notwithstanding, the Tea Mac and Summer Dog cocktails were superb.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karima R.,Everything was amazing. It's a busy place from the time they open at noon. Friday around 1220pm there was a 40 minute wait and it was worth every minute. For appetizers we had the wings and fried shrimp. They were both so damn good we ordered a second round. It was 6 of us with 6 different entrees and each was excellent. I should have written this review right away because I can't remember the dishes. Service and timing for food arrival was on point. I would definitely eat here again and wait in line if it was busy.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katie C.,"This is my favourite thai restaurant in Toronto, and many people share the same sentiments... which is why you should be prepared to wait a while before you can indulge in the food! Service & atmosphere is always good. I usually order their green curry with chicken which is served in a coconut. It comes with rice on the side as well as a small bowl of extra curry that didn't make it into the coconut. The curry is so flavourful! I really like the bamboo shoots, green peppers, and basil inside too. Paired with their thai iced tea, you can't go wrong. I've heard great things about their khao soi as well - I've been meaning to try that but I always end up with the green curry that never fails me.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah K.,"Whenever I crave Thai food, I think about Pai! They're always busy, but I never had a problem getting a seat since I was always dining with one other person. It can become quite noisy, but if you can get past that you will love it!
Dishes we ordered on my last visit for dinner: 
Gai Satay ($12.50) - The chicken was very juicy and tender, and the peanut sauce added a delicious mix of nutty, sweet and tangy flavours.
Laap Salad ($15) - This was my first time trying a Laap Salad and I was intrigued by all the different ingredients that went into making this dish. I really enjoyed the salad because the pork mix had a delicious complexity of flavours with a strong kick from the chilies. The slices of cucumber added a refreshing touch to help balance out the spice.
Starter Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp ($6.50) - If you're a fan of sour foods like me, you will love this tom yum soup! The soup was very rich, spicy and sour, a great pick-me-up for someone who's feeling under the weather.
Pad Gra Prow with Beef ($15) - The pad gra prow with beef was one of the new dishes I fell in love with. The stir fried ground beef was extremely flavourful and mouthwatering. If you'd like to try a new dish, but not keen on being too adventurous, I highly recommend this dish.
Khao Soi with Shrimp ($17) - Another fantastic new dish that I tried. The golden curry was delicious and had a thick and creamy consistency, and the egg noodles were very soft and fresh. 
I have to say that Pai is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto and if I lived downtown I would probably eat there once a week. Check them out if you haven't already, you will fall in love with their food!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elayne S.,"Covid is a very stressful economic environment for restaurants to be operating in, in that they are hoping that they will survive the storm. On the other hand if you are  going to support a business shouldn't they be operating with respect to their patrons?  I ordered and picked up Khao Soi tonight.  I went home to be disappointed in the 3 cups of coconut milk sauce I received and 1 once of chicken breast, and believe me I weighted the chicken!  This is a terrible disregard for customers.  You can fool some of the people some of the time, but they will never fool me again, and perhaps never fool anyone who reads this post.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kathy O.,Khao Soi and their Grambong fries are my go-to orders always! They never dissappoint. Their Pad Thai recipe unfortunately is too sweet for me.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah S.,"Cool and casual bohemian ambience with fantastic food! I had beef masaman curry which was full of thick, coconut flavour and the meat was so tender. The petite potatoes in the curry were an absolute delight. I also tried Khao Soi from my friends and it was also delicious. It has flat noodles and the gravy works as a soup-ish base. Comes with braised beef/chicken breasts/drumsticks. All of those meat options work great with the flavour. It's super filling though so come hungry. I also tried the the basil and crispy pork with egg on top--if you like spicy, definitely take this dish!! Even tho we went for lunch, this has a more dinner-y vibe with a cocktail menu and all. Loved the place overall and definitely coming back !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angel L.,"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto and definitely worth the wait. Go early, leave your name and number down for a table, then go to one of the nearby bars for a drink while you wait. 
Pad Thai - one of the best and most flavourful Pad Thais in the city. Comes with chopped peanuts on the side, and you can select your spiciness level. 
Khao Soi - a heavier noodle soup. Soup is incredibly flavourful and creamy
Chang Mai Beef Noodle Soup - slight hint of heat, and incredibly flavourful soup base. Beef is tender and melts in your mouth. Wonton chips on top add the perfect bit of crunch. 
Only issue is we had to wait about 30 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily X.,"Around: $20/person
Summary: A slight more expensive thai food place, with good service, but OK food.
Wait time: long~
Tips: do not ordered curry as take out during dinner
I know this place is probably a popular joint for thai food. However, I just found it a OK. I like Khan San Road better (moved to a new place now). This place does not give me a ""Wow"" feeling like Khan San Road.
I have been here a couple of times.
I ordered curry to go. For around $40, I got 2 very small box of curry. I knew for sitting down, the curry came in a coconut, however, for to go, it is just in a plastic bowl. Tastes good, but the portion is tiny.
I also been sat down for lunch, ordered curry again. I was expecting a curry in a coconut like dinner time, however, it just came in a metal bowl. I guess they cut down the cost during lunch, and the curry tastes a bit too salty. The thai ice tea is also too too too sweet to drink. I just ended up dilute with water.
Maybe I ordered wrong curry dish, but it takes like average curry I could get at Thai restaurant and a bit expensive as well.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ryan W.,"Went here for a work offsite - Food was out faster than I could order a drink.  I want to say that that was a bad thing, but  it wasn't.  
Being at a work function, it was probably better that I did not pump system full of liquor.. as much as I would've liked that.
End of the day - outstanding!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nhi G.,Amazing food! Great vibes! I would recommend going on a weekday when they first open. The wait is pretty long if you go later. You can also reserve on their website but spots fill up pretty fast.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Heather C.,"Amazing Thai Food!
This is as real as it gets in the city! Note: if you do not have a spice tolerance, make sure you choose conservatively when you choose your spice level.
The green curry is delicious, creamy and full of veggies and meat. When it comes in the young coconut, it is beautiful, and the young coconut adds a beautiful spice break and richness to the dish.
The red curry with beef is SUPER flavourful and delicious, there are both fried noodles and boiled noodles in this dish which are a beautiful textural component. The dish is incredibly filling.
The pad thai was delicious and very flavourful and served fresh and hot (noodles were chewy and not overdone at all). The chicken wings were delicious with their sauce and the different spices and herbs made is super yummy with strong thai flavours. 
The mojito type drink (cannot remember the name, but it had mint, gin and citrus) was very good, but a little on the sweeter side. The seasonal coconut ice cream was to die for (I was already bursting but somehow managed to pack it in on account of how delicious it was). 
Service was good and the ambience is cute (though not necessarily thai). There are cure sitting areas at the front, but the place fills up fast!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Denise C.,"This is arguably my favourite restaurant in Toronto. Partly because of sentimental reasons and partly because of the amazing deliciousness. Everything is well seasoned and flavourful. Our go-tos are the Khao Soi chicken and Chiang Mai Beef noodles. He loves the Thai Iced tea...it come overly sweet but as you drink, keep adding water to dilute it (if you so choose). The lineups are indicative of their food, so definitely expect to wait in line unless you get there just as the doors open or at odd times. Pai is always my favourite reco for visitors to Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea D.,"Restaurant gets busy, but surprisingly the place is pretty big. Arrived 35 minutes before closing on a Monday night and got seated within 15 minutes. Ambience was really cool and unique. 
We ordered two cocktails, the spicy P and Kawhian Punch which both could have used a little more alcohol.  As far as food, we ordered the Pad Thai and the Pad Gra Prow. Overall we thought the food was enjoyable. 
Nice experience",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley D.,"My visit to Pai this time was just OK. I went on a Wednesday evening. 
The food as uaual is outstanding - I am addicted to the Garlic Shrimp and the Khao Soi (I literally order it every time, I'm not joking)
The drinks were also good and quite strong so no complaints.
My only issue this time was the service, or lack there of. We waited about 20 minutes for our table which wasn't terrible, however once seated we waited and waited for someone to come over. I had to flag down the wait staff multiple times throughout the evening to order or ask for things. We ordered drinks and waited for almost 25 minutes before they came - I had to actually ask again for them to which they showed up within 2 minutes...weird. I asked 4 times for a straw. Noone came to check on us once we got our food or ask if we wanted more drinks. We even had to ask for boxes for our left over food.
I will come back because I love this place but the service was so disappointing.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bug B.,great thai food. affordable rate. delecious. Thanks for the great hospitality,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Beatrice A.,"Delicious food, $5 daily shots (flower power is so good), lots of seating, little bit loud but definitely great atmosphere for groups! Line wait was around 15-30 mins for a group of 10, however worth the wait. If you're coming in groups, tips are already included in the total.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacob P.,I love the golden curry I had here.  It's high end Thai food.  The atmosphere was intimate and I would definitely go again.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lori M.,"This was our favorite dining experience while visiting Toronto. 
We tried the Khao Soi Chicken and the Gaeng Masaman Beef. My favorite was the beef. The sauce was super flavorful, and the beef was very tender. The peanuts mostly sank to the bottom, but provided a nice crunchy surprise.
There was a growing line when we arrived, but we were seated quickly. I was incredibly surprised to realize how large this restaurant is. There is seating for about 250 people throughout the sprawling basement space. The waitstaff and kitchen were efficient, and we received our order in about 10-15 minutes. The line had grown even longer by the time we left - always a good sign you've found a great place to enjoy!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Max C.,"The food at Pai reminds me of what I had in weekend markets in Thailand. The interior design is very chic and the restaurant is quite big. I found the interior to be quite different among different sections of the restaurant, which is always fun. 
It's difficult to get in without waiting for a long time for dinner, but I find that if you arrive around 5:30, they can usually accommodate you.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James R.,The chicken wings are fantastic! Enjoyed the fresh quality taste. Would recommend for a quick bite !,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andy C.,"The atmosphere in this restaurant is modern and clean with an interesting decor. I tried the Khao Soi with beef which our server said was one of the chef's specials. It was egg noodles served in a golden curry broth with crunchy ""noodles"" on top and chunks of tender beef. The curry was delicious, the noodles were good, and the beef was hearty, ample, and tender. Great satisfying meal.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenyl Rose S.,"Good Thai Iced Tea but if you ask for light ice, they'll serve it in a smaller glass. Panang is okay but I've had better. Khao Sol is pretty good. Place has a really small selection of foods.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Keeley M.,"Delicious food, great service!!! Cozy atmosphere and quick service.  We loved this restaurant and highly recommend making a food stop here!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hollina U.,"Pai makes me want to hop on a plane and travel the 500 miles it would take to get from Chicago to Toronto for a good Thai meal. I haven't had such a good Thai meal in as long as I can remember-- at least 6-7 years. The pad thai and the pad gra prow were both so damn good that I couldn't stop myself from eating even after I was full to the point that I was still full 8 hours later. And even at that point, I wanted to return to the restaurant to get more food before we had to hop on the bus to head to Hamilton, our next stop on our vacation. Cocktails here aren't too bad either-- I had the Lowry and the Winter Dog, but what I really wanted was the Tea Mac (or whatever drink it was that had Thai tea in it) but they said they were out of the ingredients.
Service here isn't great-- we had to wave down our server anytime we needed anything and I was so parched for water. Buuuuuuuut the food is so good I'd happily put up with it again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah S.,"Tip:-
Utter disappointment-I went by the ratings and didn't read Barbara or Stephanie's reviews-Below average Thai food I guess I have had better.No flavor no kick in the taste?",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Almira Alice L.,"Best Thai place in Toronto. The location is a little hidden and sign is not that obvious. But the food is awesome. I've tried many items on the menu and never a disappointment. Curry, Khaoi soi, pad thai, pork belly. alll very good",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mae F.,"4.5 stars! My husband and I LOVE this place - we eat here usually once a month. We've tried several things on the menu and haven't been really disappointed yet! My favourites are the green curry with chicken (so cute served in a coconut!) and the ox tail ginger curry. Other amazing eats here are the chef nuit pad thai and khao soi with braised beef (noodles in a golden curry sauce). We also like the fried fish (crispy basa fillets) and spring rolls here. Friends always get the braised beef in peanut tamarind sauce (gaeng masaman dish) and the thai iced tea, which are also good.
The pad gra prow (stir fried ground beef with an egg over rice) is also flavourful but doesn't seem worth the $13 price tag since it's so simple to make.
This place is crazy busy all the time but so easy to see why - the food is delicious and quality is amazing. Be prepared to wait an hour or more but it's so worth the wait! The staff are friendly and I love the casual underground atmosphere.
Bonus: they have drinks named after some of the Raptors!
The 0.5 star off is due to the wait to get seated and actually get food (though it's worth it), as well as the cramped seating with not so comfy chairs. If you don't mind these cons much, you'll love this place like we do!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lili Y.,"Pai is a difficult restaurant for me to review because the food was hyped up quite a bit prior to my dining experience and my expectations were set higher than normal. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience and I would return back. 
Food: 4 stars - lots of variety, sharing/snack dishes,  good portions, my Khao Soi was very rich and a little too far on the sweet side
Atmosphere: 4.5 stars - very casual/fun, trinkets and odds and ends throughout the restaurant, 
booked well in advance or be prepared to wait for a table
Service: 5 stars - prompt, professional, knowledgable, engaging",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tony N.,"Pad Gra Prao.
This is the only dish I eat here now, and with good reason.
Yes it may LOOK simple (rice, fried egg, basil, pork, fish sauce) but I'm not sure why we are not able to replicate this at home. They definitely got some seductive additives in here I swear.
Though the restaurant still gets SO busy during the evening hours, I still say it is better then some of their other competitors down the street. Koh Lipe does have bigger portion and is newer to the scene, but I think Pai still holds a spot in my heart.
Come here and order the Pad Gra Prao. Or fine - order the Khao Soi. Doesn't matter which one you do - you won't go wrong. You can come back to me for an imaginary refund but you definitely won't be needing to!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lopa R.,"This might be the best Pad Thai I've ever tasted, and I've had a lot of Pad Thai in my life. They have 5 spice levels, and I got the second spiciest - farang spicy. I loved it, but I definitely needed a lot of water to wash it down as it had quite the kick to it! I would recommend a spice level (or two) down if you don't like it hot. I also tried some of my friend's spring rolls and beef salad which were delicious as well. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for amazing Thai food in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rita G.,"One of the best things I ever ate and I eat a lot of good food. It's been two months since we visited Toronto and I'm still thinking of that night I dined at Pai. The beef in my soup was the most tender flavorful beef I've had.y mouth is watering as I write this review. Everything we had that evening was everything we ever wanted in a Thai restaurant. The cocktails were beautiful and tasty as well. The environment was not what you would expect. It had an underground pub style, which made it a place I wanted to stay an hang out. The couple that opened his place has done an excellent job at making it feel local. Next time I visit Toronto I will make a beeline to this place straight from the airport. Well done Pai!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrei A.,"Pai is a truly authentic Thai place I always like to go to. The vibe is cool and the food tastes great. It's conveniently located in downtown Toronto close to all the major attractions. The service is reasonably fast and attentive given how big this place is.
I honestly can't say anything negative about it and I'm a pretty picky guy. I just like 'em :)
Check 'em out if you're into Thai food and form your own opinion. IMO, Thai food is one of the best in the world along with Japanese, South American and Indian, as long as it's authentic, 'cause there are PLENTY of crappy ethnic restaurants in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lawrence H.,"Worth the hype. Super quick to grab a table, came at a very odd time of the day though - Wednesday at 3PM. The Khao soi was perfect, the Penang was also amazing.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeff S.,"Took a chance around 6:30pm on Sunday without a reservation. Waited in line about 10 minutes and then we were told it would be about 1/2 hour, unless we wanted to sit at the bar. We always enjoy the bar seats so we jumped at it.
An hour later we rolled out, full, happy and aiming to come back!
We started with the garlic shrimp. Well seasoned with a delicious tamarind dipping sauce. We both had the Khao Soi ( one beef, one chicken drumsticks). Incredible depth and richness to the broth. The beef was tender and delicious and the chicken was excellent. The crispy noodles add a great crunch texture. 
The sangria was fantastic. No room for dessert but maybe next time! A fun environment with quick and attentive service.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Slavisa M.,"I mean, the reviews average says it all. Pai is absolutely amazing. Great atmosphere, great location, great food and great service. Cannot really go wrong.
The only frustrating thing about it is actually its popularity. Sometimes the wait can be quite long (despite the good capacity they can accommodate), especially for lunch during work days. My trick: come 11:45am and avoid the 12pm insanity that ensues in trying to get a spot. 
In terms of food, you cannot go wrong with anything on their menu, but I would definitely recommend the khao soi and their pad thai. They also have probably the best spring rolls in the city!
Bon Appétit!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Denise C.,"Busy, even on a late Wednesday night, so make reservations. The service was good even if we have to wait a little, they were balancing a lot of customers each. The ambiance is hipster surfer vibe, cool for a fun date. We started with the Northern Thai sausage, which is very good and served with picked veggies and sticky rice, definitely recommend.  The mains came out faster than I thought theu would. I ordered Khao Soi with the beef.  This is a heavy dish and a generous portion.  I have a healthy appetite and I was stuffed. The flavors melded so well, and it was a full bodied taste without having to be spicy. I asked for mild spice. We finished with the mango sticky rice, very good and a solid choice. The service was out of this world and it was my favorite meal of my trip.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Excited2Eat E.,"We finally got to try Pai after reading lots of good review on it. We had high expectation came in and we definitely weren't disappointed. The portion was decent, 3 people ordered 2 main dishes and 1 salad appetizer, we were all very full after. The sangria was also delicious! We really enjoyed the pad Thai and the green coconut curry! Highly recommended ! 
Another tip: try to get there as early as they open for the day to avoid long waits.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gina J.,"Have been there for 3 times, I have to say I am not a huge fun of Thai style curry, but their pad Thai is amazing! I have tried with chicken one and beef one, I personally love the chicken one a little bit more, since they are softer. 
Mango and sticky rice is a special Thai dessert, really worth to try if you like coconut milk.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,A T.,"Pai is honestly close to a 4.5 stars but for a few real reasons I will stick with a solid 4 stars.I've been to Pai a few times and even bought takeout once. This place really is one of the best Thai food downtown. I haven't had anything I didn't enjoy here so far. 
What I have tried: Khao soi, Chiang Mai beef noodle soup, pad gra prow, pad Thai, and Miang Kung. 
Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup: this is probably my favourite at Pai. Comes with nice beef chunks but it is the tangy flavourful beef broth that makes this dish a star. The noodles are flat rice noodles (like pho). This is a must try and is good for sharing as well. 
Pad Thai: you can't go wrong with the classic. It is really delicious as well. Flavours all work perfectly together. 
Khao Soi: probably pai's most popular dish. A very creamy golden curry that is not really that spicy. The crunchy egg noodles are delicious. I personally find it a bit heavy so it is good for sharing or if you can't finish the sauce, doggy bag it and bring it home to have it with rice. 
Pad Gra Prow: flavours are on point, it goes so well with the rice and egg. If you don't like noodles or curry, then this is solid. 
Miang Kung: this is an appetizer where you put a bunch of toppings into betel leaf and eat it together. This needs to be shared as it comes in a big platter - between 3 to 4 people is ideal. It is very refreshing so no worries that it will fill you up. Ingredients are quite simple but everything goes very well together - the pomelo and garlic brings out a nice kick and a very refreshing taste. 
The one down side about this place is it does get very busy so it is difficult to find a table (even on weekdays). You can make reservations but you do have to almost make it one month in advance now. Atmosphere wise is also so-so, it's a bit dark inside which can be nice but it is so noisy so it is quite hard to hold a conversation without yelling across the table. Props though for having hooks for coats near most tables.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danny C.,"Dropped in at Pai on a Tuesday evening and the place was happening! We grabbed some seats at the bar to avoid the wait. Despite the busy crowd, the service was quick, attentive and personal. The drinks and food looked and tasted great. Definitely worth a return visit and now I know to call ahead!
I had the Thai iced tea and the pad thai, my standard go-to for any first visit. They definitely hit the spot in terms of flavour, portion and price. Can't wait to try the other items next time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rob G.,"This is probably my favorite place to eat in Toronto.  
We found this place on a whim, because we were looking for a place close to where we were, and luckily found parking.  It didnt really look like much from the outside when we passed it but still decided to venture in.  We were really surprised.  It was a small flight of stairs down and we were seated rather quickly since it was still early.  We apparently beat the dinner crowd because by the time we left it was mobbed with a line waiting to get inside.
The menu was quite extensive and we tried a lot of things between the 5 of us.  The food was really good, and varied from traditonal dishes like pad thai and curry to more exotic.  Everything we ordered I would order again.
The service was good too, especially as it got busier, we didnt have any issues with refills or ordering additinal items.
Overall this was a great find and I would definitely go back if I was in the area.  You should give it a try if you are nearby.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Luis L.,"First off this place is a total gem. The only downside to this spot was a bit of a slow service, hence the 4 stars but they definitely made up for it. A very cozy ambience and the food was delicious. For starters/apps,  I recommend the spring rolls and the Kung Tawt (garlic shrimp). Also, if you're a fan of spicy food then the Tom Yum Soup will definitely have your mouth scorching, proceed with caution. For the main dish the Chef Nuit Pad Thai or/and the Thai Fried Rice is a MUST!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adara D.,"Took me awhile to come back and let y'all know how amazing this place was. It was our first spot we ate at in Toronto! We were seated at the bar bc this place was poppinnnnn'. Khao Soi was the yummy dish I ordered and still dream of it til' this day. I met my V first Canadian friend, Tiffany, and we've been in touch ever since! The rumors are true, Canadians are hella friendly and Pai is the place to be!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle N.,"The restaurant is extremely busy. My coworker and I went after work around 5:30 PM and there was already a line up out the door. Once you get to the host, they will give you a buzzer and you can wait by the bar. The restaurant is quite big and we waited about 40 mins before we got seated. The waiters were busy so getting a hold of one got difficult at times but that was understandable. Food was delicious and a reasonable price. We got the Pad Thai, Khao Soi and the Miang Kham. We each got a caesar as well, but that wasn't as good as the food as it had an odd taste.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Myung Jin K.,"An authentic Thai restaurant right in the heart of downtown Toronto - near University and King. My daughter and I visited Pai Northern Thai Kitchen on a Wednesday afternoon at around 3:45pm and we were surprised to see how busy it was. When we traveled to Chiang Mai, we stayed at a bed and breakfast run by a woman named Pai and her husband. Pai, in Chiang Mai made some of the most delicious Thai cuisine I have ever encountered. I was hoping for some of the same taste sensations at Pai Northern Thai Kitchen.
The decor is hipster/funky. The atmosphere is loud and slightly aggressive - the music is played at a loud volume. The bathrooms are clean and functional.
While we were seated quickly, we waited a bit for the waitstaff to come to our table so we could order. My daughter and I were not in a rush so the wait wasn't tedious, but I can imagine if you wanted to get on with your day, this wouldn't be the place for a quick meal - largely due to needing to wait to order. Once we did order, our drinks came quickly as well as our food.
My daughter ordered a coconut water. Normally, when we order coconut water at Thai restaurants, it comes in a coconut - which is an added bonus for me, who likes to scoop out the coconut meat. Unfortunately, at Pai's it is served in a glass - the same size glass as water is served. While the size is on the large size, it was disappointing to not have the coconut meat with the coconut water.
My daughter ordered their signature Pad Thai with chicken. She loved it and ate everything on her plate - except the banana leaf. I ordered the tofu with rice and fried egg. I'm beginning to think Toronto loves their salt. It was delicious, but salty. I couldn't put the fish sauce over the rice because it would make the dish much too salty. I usually love the umani taste of the fish sauce over rice. I order the Farang spice level and next time, I'll order the Thai spice level because Farang was way too mild. I had to get more Thai chilies on the side.
We will gladly come back to Pai's in the future. The price point for each dish was pricier than expected, but the quality was fresh and tasty.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hailey C.,"This lively Thai restaurant is trendy and very busy. Their customer service is great and the food is top notch. We sat at a floor table on some comfy cushions on the side and had the whole table to ourselves.
I tried the green curry, which comes in a coconut bowl with a side of rice. The dish was rich, flavourful, and just the right amount of spice (slow burn). But like other yelpers, I had a really upset stomach after, so I assumed I got food poisoning. I emailed Pai to let them know and their owner assured me they were looking into it and invited me back for a meal on the house. When we returned, the owner came by our table to check in on us and I was so floored by his attentiveness and the other staff's friendliness.
They think the Thai eggplant in the green curry is causing stomach issues (it's a natural laxative). They've removed the eggplant from the green curry so hopefully that isolates the problem!
Must try: shrimp chips (off the menu) a basket of them comes with oyster sauce
Pad thai (it's the safe option and they make a really good one **fellow cilantro-haters: ask for no cilantro!**
Pass on the mango sticky rice, it was waaaay too sweet.
For the stellar customer service, lively atmosphere and delicious food, I'm sold on Pai.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Davina C.,"Great food, fun atmosphere. Reliable spot to take friends from out of town! Always add the fritters to any order.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Juno Y.,"Awesome restaurant with vibrant energy great selection of authentic Thai food and friendly staff
The owner Jeff 's spirit shows in taste of food, music and sports!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris M.,"This is one of my favourite restaurants. I highly recommend the Massaman curry, green curry, and Pad Thai. Also the Thai Iced Tea is delicious!
It's a crowded place, however, so be ready to wait a while for a table if you go during prime time. The ambiance is fantastic, although it is a little loud.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeffrey T.,"it was my last day in Toronto and i really wanted a comfy food so i chose this place. my local buddies agreed that Pai is a must when visiting Toronto. especially if you love Thai food.
so we got here around 12.15PM and it was already packed. we had to wait about 20ish mins for a table which was no biggie at all. we weren't in a rush except that my flight was about 5 hours away. lol
we sat down and ordered a bunch of stuff, we were doing family style.
- Tom Yum Kung - this is an interesting tom yum soup that i have never had before. its sour and refreshing but it was wayyy richer than the one that i am used to in Los Angeles. i would say it was on the heavier end for a soup.
- Moo Ping - i didn't expect them to have this skewer. the marinade was sweet and savory just like one of those marinated short rib that you get on korean bbq restaurant. meat was very tender but $3.5 for a skewer could be a little too much for some people.
- Pad Thai - interesting take of pad thai. really good but not used to seeing this kind of pad thai. it was wetter and darker. for most pad thais, the flavor comes from the tamarind paste but for this particular pad thai, the tamarind flavor was very mild and flavor was mainly from the sauces (oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, i believe these are what they use, i could be wrong)
- Pad Kra Pow with Crispy Pork - i have had better, but theirs weren't too bad. the weakest dish among the 4. 
in short, this isnt the kind of Thai food that i have been exposed to so far. the taste and texture have been adjusted, i can no longer call them authentic Thai food. However, it was really delicious and i enjoyed every single dish that we ordered.
service was great too, food came out pretty fast and she was able to get us everything that we needed.
will i come back? absolutely.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arora S.,"Gluten-free review:
The vast majority of items on the menu here can be made gluten-free and my go-to ones are the Chef Nuit Pad Thai or the Gaeng Masaman. Both are super delicious. Make sure you specify you need your item to be gluten-free though because most aren't normally gluten free. I also recommend getting the thai iced tea if you like the taste of roasted tea.
As for cross contamination, I am not sure how everything is prepared in the kitchen as I didn't ask. I have a moderate intolerance and do not have celiac's disease, however in the numerous times I've been here I've never had a reaction to the food. 
TL;DR most options can be made gluten-free; thai iced tea is yum",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mary Carol M.,"Pai is phenomenal.  I was visiting Toronto last weekend and a colleague and I dined here last Thursday night.  
We ordered the plah nua (beef salad) ($14), miang kung (another salad served with the separate components on the dish to be eaten on a betel leaf) ($15), and gaeng kiaw wan (green curry served in a coconut) ($17.50).
It was exceptional.  The perfect meal for my first night ever in Toronto.  I wanted to come back that Sunday for lunch when I was back in Toronto but they do not open until 3pm on Sunday.  
I've eaten Thai food all around the world- it is one of my very favorite cuisines.  And Pai is one of the very best restaurants I have been to.  I can't wait to visit Toronto again; as someone who rarely repeats restaurants because I am always wanting to explore, I am heading back to Pai.
*Thank you to the hostess, for your warm welcome early on and to our wonderful waiter who chatted with us at length and knew it was our first visit to the restaurant and my first visit to Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rick H.,"A lot of fun, great food, but the noise level was a bit much and made it feel like a place where one scarfs food down and then exits fast.  It's cavernous two, more than 100 seats easily. The papaya salad was great: explosion of flavour in the mouth; we opted for salted crab with ours -- whole pieces, shell and all, which might not be to everyone's taste. The chchirones and prawn crackers that come with the dish are perfect. The best dish was the pork pad gra prow, nicely flavored ground pork with rice and a runny fried egg.  The Khao Soi disappointed:  egg noodles in a very rich, maybe overly rich, lightly curried coconut soup with shrimp (one can also order this with chicken or beef) . Staff were very good, but the ambiance, or utter lack thereof, kills it.  Maybe good for takeout though.  Nice to see they have locally brewed Izumi sake on tap.
Chris Nuttal-Smith more or less nailed it in his Globe review:

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Teresa H.,"3.5
Pai is hands down my favourite Thai restaurant, and still is. But last night, we were given plates with bits of rice stuck on the top and bottom. So we had to change our plates - hence half star is taken off. 
I had the khao soi with chicken and I think it would've been better if I had it with beef. We waited almost 30 mins for our food to arrive. It was incrediblely busy and I definitely recommend making a reservation! Thai ice tea is also a must when you come here.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marcus S.,"Food, music, ambiance was incredible. I'm dining alone and just wanted to eat and roll so I wasn't paying much attention to service til the end when this guy Jonny is so caught up in telling the table next to me that some woman from SNL was there that he hands me the card thing takes it back, I thank HIM and he's just talking to the table and walks away. I initially left 20% but he came back to tell me the card machine was on the fritz so I had to do it again. How fortuitous. 
I gotta assume this place is amazing when the servers aren't star struck. I'll be back",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cassie P.,"Delicious, authentic, thai food!!! Be careful on how hot you order your food- even the medium spice will burn going down.  
Even though there was a long line out the door on a Saturday night, it moved quickly and we were sat within a few minutes.  Service was friendly and quick.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie S.,"Tasty?  Yes.
Smaller portions, overhyped, & a few dollars more expensive than a ma&pa place?  Also yes.
Above the decent food, this place survives on buzz and atmosphere.  Subterranean digs is sorta a cross between an island bar/resto.  It is loud, dark, & jammed with knick knacks.
Wait for 2 ppl, on a Wednesday evening, was an hour.  You give the hostess your cell, they give you a pretty accurate estimate, & you'll get a text msg letting you know that your table is ready.  You can respond NO if you've decided to eat elsewhere.  Despite the wait, they've imposed a pretty convenient system, so that was good.
Food took approx. 20mins to arrive (I timed it!), but you sorta don't realise it because it is soo loud.
I ordered the Masaman Beef Curry ($15, I guess they raised the prices as per online menu) and it came in a medium sized soup bowl.  There was maybe 4-5 chunks of brisket, but the rest was a curry soup.  Tasty, but it would've been more fairly priced at $12-13.  Pad Thai tasty good too, but ~$15 and portion was on the adequate, but on the smaller side.  Unlike other Thai places that I've been too, YOU WILL NOT BE TAKING HOME LEFTOVERS if you just order 1 main per person!
There seemed to be a gap after 8pm where, if you're lucky, you can walk in and get a table for a small party.  Otherwise, you'll be waitlisted.
Worth the wait?  If you're up for an experience and never tasted decent Thai food, yes.  Otherwise, you'll survive skipping this one.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lindsay L.,"I was thoroughly impressed!!! The resturant, just off of Adelaide, is small but got busy really fast on  a Saturday afternoon. I ordered their pad thai with chicken and was happy with how much chicken there was. The sauce on the pad thai was light, yet flavourful with just the right amount of spice. The noodles had great taste and texture. Overall, the pad thai was a great choice and worth trying. The beef curry was also great! The curry wasn't overly spicy and had a depth of flavours from the coconut milk and various spices. As well, the beef was tender and paired well with the rice. We also got the chicken skewers and were quite blown away with the house made sauces; a fish sauce with citrus fruits and a peanut satay, which were both amazing on the tender chicken and on their own. Seriously some of the best Thai food I've ever had, definitely worth checking out!",5

Getting In
We didn't get to make a reservation beforehand though it is highly, highly recommended that you do so. Our visit to Pai was kind of a spur of the moment thing, as we were originally planning to go for a nice brunch (it was Saturday) at another place before we changed our minds last minute. We decided to try our luck and just entered the restaurant without calling prior to our arrival.
Thankfully, we were able to grab two seats by the bar without much wait. Other than the bar, the majority of the tables were full and we would've had to wait for awhile otherwise.
Ordering
The bartender who also took care of us was really friendly and helpful. As it was our first time here, we had trouble making decisions on the menu - well my hubby did (I was set on Pad Thai, as it's my go to order whenever it's my first visit at a new Thai restaurant). After receiving a couple of recommendations from the bartender, hubby decided to try their Thai fried rice on the lunch menu. I also opted for their coconut water as it's a must order for me in Thai restaurants.
Pad Thai
In my opinion, I have pretty high standards for Pad Thai; I always order it when I can and because I always order it, I tend to compare restaurants and their versions all the time. At Pai, the dish was delicious but it was not as spicy as I would've liked it to be. It also didn't have enough of the fish sauce taste, which is the original sauce used to cook Pad Thai. The dish was more brown in colour than red, perhaps they used more oyster sauce than chili and fish sauce? Overall, the noodles were cooked well and the dish had a wide variety of vegetables and meat, but to me, the original fish sauce was lacking. And I'm right - the menu online says that the pad thai is cooked using the restaurant's house made tamarind sauce and oyster sauce.
Worth ordering? Yes, but it doesn't seem that authentic to me.
Thai Fried Rice
The sauce on the side is fish sauce! Named nam plik nam pla, it is made with fish sauce, garlic, chili and lime. In our opinion, it was a great complement to the fried rice. The fried egg on top was very crispy and well done while keeping the egg yolk still tender, and overall, the fried rice wasn't too overly flavoured. I quite liked that the rice wasn't fried together with the chicken and vegetables so that you could choose how savoury each bite could be. The dish was a little greasy but it's fried rice after all so you can't complain.
Verdict
Overall, our short lunch at Pai was pretty good. Service was great, and I thought that the price of the dishes were well priced as well. Its casual vibe is a hit for most Torontonians, and it really feels like you're in Thailand during your meal as its interior décor is pretty authentic feeling. It's a great restaurant to come with friends and family, colleagues, after work, or even just by yourself for a quick meal at the bar. Can't make it? Try ordering online through their website!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Byris L.,"I have literally recommended this place to SO many friends. Hands down my favourite go-to Thai restaurant in Toronto!
Went again tonight (on a gross slushy Wednesday after work). We arrived at 5PM and were able to get seated right away. The restaurant started getting really busy half an hour later. TIP: arrive as early as possible! It often gets busy, even on a weekday!
I've honestly been to this place so many times. My go-to dish is often the green curry. I love that it comes in a coconut with extra sauce on the side. I will always finish that additional bowl of sauce and scoop up every last inch of the insides of the coconut because it's that great! Highly recommend!
I'd also recommend getting the Squash Fritters, Thai Iced Tea and the Pad Gra Prow (with beef). They're all amazingly delicious and I've had a fair share of them in my diet. You simply can't go wrong with Pai!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brooke R.,My sister and I took a long weekend holiday in Toronto in March. We STILL talk about Pai! Everything is amazing. Servers are so friendly and accommodating. Food is fantastic. We went twice we loved it so much.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle N.,"The food here is amazing but the wait for us to be seated and for us to even get our food was a little too long for my liking.
We were a larger group (6) people and it took us about 45 minutes to get a table. Once seated, the waitress didn't come until about 15 min later. 
I would highly recommend the khao soi and the spring rolls! I got the coconut green curry. It is plated in a coconut which looks very nice but definitely overpriced for the amount of food we got.
Summary: if you have a lot of time, check this place out. If you're starving or in a rush, the dinner rush may not be the best option.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fran F.,"Best Thai food ever! Came here so many times and even got a whole bunch of takeout. 
Pad Gra Pow- Basil was so fragrant and the egg was cooked perfectly 
Chiang Mai Beef Noodle- OMG so tasty! It has a tangy, sweet, spicy, salty  everything in your mouth taste. Beef was also nice and tender. Will always crave this
Chef Nuit Pad Thai- really authentic taste, not too sweet with that nice  tamarind base
Khao Soi- Egg noodles were nice and chewy. The soup was BOMB: creamy, savoury with deep curry flavours without being to overpowering
Go to for Thai food downtown!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yonglin G.,"Khao Soi Chicken!! First time falling in love upon the first bite because it was just THAT good. The soup wasn't too spicy and the noodles were so soft, it was such a perfect combo. They were also very generous with the chicken while most places only give a bit when it comes to meat. The chicken was really good at soaking up the soup but I will definitely try beef next time and see how that tastes with the curry. Now all I can think about is Thai food and I can't wait to explore more Thai cuisine!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Demitri H.,"Pai is the best Thai Restaurant in Toronto! So stop reading and go!
If you're still reading, then I might as well tell you why it's the best. The food is authentic, fresh and flavourful. The cocktails are great, and the decor has a really cool vibe that's welcoming yet different at the same time. 
If you're looking for a bit of a different experience, they have 1 Northern Thai style low table where you sit on the ground leaving against triangular pillows. Always a conversation starter!
As for the food, my favorites are the 'Khao Soi', a soupy bowl of curry with meat, egg noodles and crispy fried onions; and the 'Pad Gra Prow', stir fried ground meat topped with a fried egg covered in tasty thai spices. Both are rarely done right and always a good choice at Pai.
Word of caution, everybody knows it the best and therefore, the lines can get ridiculous. So prepare to wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elizabeth Y.,"Went there on Saturday for lunch, maybe around 11:30/12. They weren't super busy, but had to wait a few minutes for a table. The server said there was a mixup with their delivery and they had a limited menu. We got the Chicken Pad Thai and Khao Soi with Braised Beef. They didn't really have anything else on the menu, which was very disappointing since I wanted to try other things and am from the states. 
Chicken Pad Thai w/ Mild Spice - very good flavor. The chicken in it was good, peanuts were on the side. It was still rather spicy for ""mild spice"". 
Khao Soi w/ Braised Beef - the curry was very good and so were the noodles. The beef was tender, but super lean, so at times seemed a bit tough. I wish there were more noodles. Could've gotten a side of rice to go with the curry. 
Service was pretty slow. Lots of people standing around, but our server seemed to be everywhere but our table. Waited awhile for our order to be taken then he never came back after our food was served. Had to wave a different person over for water and the check. 
Would like to go back sometime to try other things on their menu...that is if there isn't a ""mixup with the delivery order"".",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eric W.,"FOOD: Delicious and could not stop coming back for more. I've had the Pad Gra Prow that was 10/10 crispy and savoury; the Khao Soi is a staple and the braised beef we had was cooked to mouth-watering textury perfection; the Fried Fish dish was really good and paired well with both spicy and sweet tamarind sauces. 
AMBIENCE: dim, basement bar feel. Rustic, interesting decorations. Hooks along the support beams are useful for making better use of the space.
SERVICE: all smiles and quick and prompt service. No complaints.
PRICE: At a reasonable ~$17 per entree price, Pai is pretty cost-effective for downtown. The meals are large and can certainly fill you. 
TIPS: 
* Come early as there are often lineups
* do not order tea as a $4 is not worth it for flavored water
* Experiment and try different meals here, I'm sure they're all delicious",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark L.,"Definitely a fan of Pai.
We arrived 8 PM on a Saturday, no reservation. A risky situation, only to be made worse by the fact that their kitchen closed early for an event that night (9:30). We were told there was an hour+ wait, and there was a chance we might not get a table even if we waited. 
Being downtown, I probably could've used my time better and went to one of the other billion restaurants in the city, but every single time I've visited Toronto trying to get some khao soi and squash fritters, I've been denied for one reason or another (mostly my fault, I try to go on Sundays like a dumbass when most Thai restaurants are closed). 
WELL NOT TODAY. I drove downtown for some fucking khao soi, I better get some fucking khao soi. So I toughed it out, put my name down, walked around the block several times and returned around 9:20. As luck would have it, they called us for the LAST table they would serve that night. And it was totally worth the wait.
We squeezed our order in and they served it up pretty fast. I inhaled my khao soi. The curry, the noodles, the meat. It was on point. The squash fritters were just OK, they're like less sweet sweet potato fries. I built them up too high in my head after years of drooling at IG pics from places like Khao San Road/Sukho Thai. The khao soi though is the bomb, and that alone is worth a return.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David N.,"So I would easily rank Pad Thai as one of my favorite foods of all time, which means I tend to order it anytime I spot it on a menu. The Pad Thai at Pai is easily one of the best in the city (if not the best), especially since the demise of the great Khao San Road.
We started with an order of the Spring Rolls (""Deep fried Vegetarian Spring Rolls filled with mushrooms, glass noodles, carrots and sprouts"") and they were a cut above, to be sure. They arrived to the table piping hot and accompanied with a tasty dipping sauce. I wouldn't say these were the best spring rolls I've ever had, but they certainly hit the spot.
For my main, I of course went with the Chef Nuit Pad Thai (""Stir fried rice noodle in a home made tamarind sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts"") and I ordered it Phet Mak Mak (thai spicy). (And they were definitely not kidding around with the spice!)
The dish is plentiful and delicious, and benefits from a seriously impressive layering of flavors. Just when you think you've discovered all the tastes that the dish has to offer, you take another bite that's bursting with flavors you hadn't noticed before. I mean this is a seriously tasty dish.
My one complaint would be that the service wasn't that great. If I'm ordering a plate of food at the spiciest level that you offer, I do expect you to be hovering nearby with a jug of water at all times. (As it was, my small glass was refilled only once.)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kendra S.,Best Thai in town hands down. In downtown Toronto place was packed but we were sat quickly. Definitely not the cheapest but wasn't too steep. Food was very fresh Thai hot was definitely hot like we like. Had the Tom Yum and shrimp/chicken Pad Thai with some Thai wings all very good. The Sangria was very good as well with leechee and pineapples in the pitcher.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeff I.,"The green curry was served in a young coconut which was mostly carved out. Food and cocktails were great. While a little bit more expensive than usual thai places, the environment was fun and cozy. The 90s hip hop, school chairs, and brick walls partitioning the space made the whole place feel like a little hideout.
This place was quite crowded even on a weeknight, so reservations are probably a good idea.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alena T.,"Ahhh one of my favourite Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto! If you're a huge fan of those traditional, flavourful and wonderfully spicy Thai dishes, then this is the place for you. 
Service & Environment
The restaurant is very spacious with ample seating area - they also have a very cute traditional seating area! This place has a casual, relaxed atmosphere with their dimmed lighting and trendy decor. My friend and I came on a Wednesday afternoon and there was no wait time. Like any other restaurant downtown, there isn't free parking space available. You would have to pay around 10-20 bucks to park in one of the parking lots nearby. 
Food
Khao Soi - One of my favourite Thai dishes and this place killed it. Broth was very light and not too creamy and heavy. I thoroughly really enjoyed this dish!
Pad Thai - Very flavourful and perfect amount of sauce. Ratio of noodles to vegetables and meat was also perfect. 
Mango Sticky Rice - I remember trying this last summer and was quite content about it! It was delicous.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kabir G.,"A classic case of over hyped expectations is what makes me give this place a 3 star. If i had more tempered expectations it would have been a solid 4. 
I am obviously somewhat spoiled living in Toronto and I now expect to find legit culinary spots that do justice to their roots and can stand up to their counterparts in the homeland. By that test, Pai is decent thai food but i highly doubt it would be more than a local neighborhood spot if it was located in sukhumvit. That said, we only ordered 3-4 dishes from the menu and maybe there were others which might have had a more lasting impression.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Catherine C.,Very good Thai food. Very eclectic restaurant. Definitely worth going to for dinner even if you have to wait.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Taylor B.,Y'all this place had me in tears! Everything is so good! We all ordered different things and everything was absolutely AMAZING! Please come and try the chicken pad tai! Lawd Jesus! Amazing amazing,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jasmine W.,"I get it, trying to appeal to younger people.. first of all what threw us off about the place was the prices and the that they can make things gluten free. Came to this place because of all the positive reviews. Upon arriving it sounded like a club, dim lighting, loud music.
We shared a Pad Thai and the Khao Pad Thamada ( basically beef fried rice)
The Pad Thai noodles were soggy, I personally enjoy eating noodles with more chew not just falling apart as I pick it up. The flavors were great, I have to say.
The Khao Pad Thamada was mostly rice, and the beef was hard and chewy. 
Overall coming from a family that is part Thai, living in LA with access to authentic Thai food.. wouldn't come back, and thinks this place is over rated and over priced.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grace L.,"Pai is literally my favorite Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto. The ambiance is great, Thai style with some nice Toronto touch (raptors, we the north). 
You can never go wrong with the food here. My favorite is Pad Gra Prow. It is stir fried minced meat on rice. So tasty. I would go with foreigner spicy. Unless you are really really good with spicy,  don't try Thai spicy. I learned my lesson the hard way :P Their chicken wings are very good too. The portion is small though. One order comes with three wings. 
The line can be long during lunch and dinner. They take reservation in advance but not on the same day. 
They also have a party room behind the bar that is perfect for a small party.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kaitlyn P.,"This is the TOP restaurant i would recommend to anyone in Toronto. Every single thing we ordered was delicious and the atmosphere was great! We tried the pad gra pow, green curry, pad thai, and the sticky mango rice. We already want to go back and try the rest of the foods on the menu that we didn't get to try!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laurie W.,"This is the second most reviewed place in Toronto....had to try right?
Came here on Saturday night before Easter, table for 1 (sad face) around 9pm.  I still had to wait about 40 minutes because it WAS pretty busy,  i didnt even mind the bar!
Service took a bit long but i guess its typical for a saturday night.
All i wanted was pad thai and that was what i ordered!  Intrigued by the level of spice offered,  I asked the server how spicy was the phet mek mek (the spiciest of it all, THAI SPICY is what it was referred) and she said it is like 10 out of 10, like it is really spicy.  I said ok i'll have that with my pad thai.  She asked if i was sure and had a look of concern....ok iim a little worried but they always make it seem really bad, i said im sure.  She said they won't remake it if its too spicy (i guess its my own fault if anything...) i said thats fine... (i started to panicked after she left and texted my friend for moral support)
My plate arrived and it looked pretty...dangerously pretty.  I took my first bite...and...IT BURNNNNNNNNNN....combined with the temperature, it was definitely spicy...i almost teared...but it was DELICIOUSLY BURNING SPICY!!  anyone who loves spicy...enjoys halal guys red sauce...this is the same love feeling!!  
The pad thai is sweet and tangy like pad thai normally is.  The spice mixes well with all the ingredients and the chilies just adds fuel to the delicious fire.  I had this dish with chicken and the chicken was moist and coated with the tamari sauce.  I ate it all up quickly (also so that i could avoid the build up burn!)  
The prices here are decent, maybe just a bit more than most places but converted to USD, its pretty reasonable!  I will definitely come back!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Phillip S.,"Probably the best place for Thai food in the city and among my favorites. However do keep in mind reservations must be reserved a minimum 24 hrs in advance because this place is ALWAYS busy.
Taking a chance and not making reservations I decided to take JC out for a nice surprise! Fortunately for us, though we did a walk-in and our wait was approximately 30 mins.
The ambiance is cozy with a few funky decor and some Thai related fixtures all over the place. While waiting at the bar for our seats we indulged in a few mini bar eats and drinks they had available:
she had the Tea Ross and I had their plum mule! both were great
For entree we ordered their:
-chicken pad thai and Khoa Soi with Beef: decadent, portions were enough and their prices are reasonable. 5/5
Pad Thai was cooked well, presentable, noodles were spectacularly soft.  Overall excellent dish! 4.5/5",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rohit M.,"Been here twice in 3 days. Soooo good. 
Very chill ambience with good bar seating. Chill beats set us in the mood as we sunk into our chairs with silly grins on our faces :-D
My wife and I started off with fresh coconut water during both our visits - fresh and flavorful both times! We then proceeded to try the Green Papaya salad (excellent, although the shrimp crackers could have been fresher I think). We then ordered the Garlic Shrimp with Thai chilli sauce (lightly breaded, succulent shrimps, a big hit with us), Pad Thai (well made and full of flavor), Gai Satay (succulent chicken and excellent peanut sauce), Tom Yum soup (heavier on the tomato side than i've been used to in Thailand .... but a huge hit again! It worked very well! A must try.) This was followed by Green Curry in a coconut ....... wow. Just wow. All my 5 senses were involved with this one. Definitely a must try. 
One of the best Thai places we've tried outside of Thailand. I give it 4 stars because I feel they can improve the quality of their shrimp crackers and offer more dishes on their menu. Other than that, loved the place and will definitely be back with more friends and family!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer L.,"This is probably one of the best thai food restaurants I've ever been to  the food from here is so amazing! I came here on a Wednesday afternoon, about half an hour after opening and there was already a line! I ordered the khao soi, which comes with: egg noodles, golden curry, crispy noodles, your choice of meat (I got the braised beef), coriander, and green onions.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Donald B.,"Food tasted really good, the place was packed, the staff was friendly and attentive.
I would recommend calling ahead for a reservation, but walk-ins are welcome.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carmel P.,The spring rolls are to die for!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amélie S.,"Favorite pick in Toronto so far. I had the chance to travel in Thailand and the food from Pai was tasting the same (with less spice). The perfect amount of spice, right level of sweet/salty, good portions and fair price. The place is VERY busy we went at 4pm on a Saturday and waited about 20min, definitely worth the wait. I would highly recommend for Asian food fans and will definitely come back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Scott M.,"Interesting below street level pub style restaurant and bar. We came in for dinner and were seated immediately with drink orders taken. I ordered the Panang curry with chicken, a bowl of rice and a side of spring rolls and my wife ordered the chicken satay. Both meals were generous and delicious. The menu however seemed limited for a Thai restaurant but the prices were very reasonable. The service was very friendly, informative and attentive. I would eat here again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Scott D.,The food here is beyond amazing! Staff are friendly and the buzz is infectious. If you're in Toronto you have to visit no matter the wait!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sam G.,"This place got busy very quickly! We thankfully had a reservation. And they only have a limited amount of seats they reserve as they have a ton of foot traffic. Food was delicious! Service was great. I was told that this was a nice place to take a date but I think its a little too loud. It was hard to hear conversations in the resto. So if you actually want to hear what your date is saying then go elsewhere. However if you want delicious food, with great service, great atmosphere and dont mind if its a little loud then this is the place for you!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kayleigh O.,"This was my favorite meal I have ever had. Don't skip this place. We had the best time.. the establishment runs like a well tuned machine and is very efficient! We had the squash fritters, pad Thai and khao soi and it was delicious! The saki bombs are awesome too, 4 for $20 can't beat that!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ellie S.,I had best  Pad Thai in their location and it's my go to phage when I want to have Asian food,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tania F.,I thought the food seemed pretty authentic. The service was good snd the place was clean,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Britt C.,"One of the top rated places on Toronto and for good reason! I saw Pai had Khao Soi on the menu being that it's my favorite Thai dish and hard to find in Phoenix I made this a must try. I was with my classmates one  who is vegan and was a little worried that there wouldn't be many options for him, but there were plenty that could be made vegan on the menu. I wasn't expecting much as far as ambiance, but the restaurant was pretty trendy and a cool spot to hang out. They even had tables on the floor with cushions just like Thailand. The Khao Soi was as authentic as it could get, exactly like I had in Thailand. I will definitely return and would highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roy A.,"A must visit while in Toronto! If you are a true foodie you will appreciate the quality of detail in the dishes and cocktails. Wings, pork skewers and beef pad Thai was on point. Hands down the best Thai we had in Toronto, do yourself the favor. Enjoy!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivian S.,"okay these people know how to doThai and how to do take out right!
got the Pad Thai and the pork pad graw pow..ordered a papaya salad too.
great flavour.. not heavy and sauce laden ..
have tried their sister resto Sukho Thai which is just as delish!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara E.,"The food was delicious, ambiance was awesome, and there wasn't much of a wait time. We were sat off to the side, which was much quieter than the main space.
We ordered two entrees and one cocktail. I had the sangria with pineapple and lychee ($11), which was yummy, albeit mostly ice. 
For dinner we had the leaf wraps with shrimp ($15 entree) and a chicken pad Thai. It was not even close to enough food. A small fist-sized pile of noodles and the wraps had 1 tiny shrimp for each, plus minced toppings that amounted to maybe 3 bites total. We left hungry and paid over $50. Plus, we asked for the wraps to come out as an appetizer so we could split both easily, but they came out at the same time to our tiny table, making it very difficult to share.
Rice noodles are cheap! Add some more to fill up your guests!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marz R.,"I love this place. I've never had a bad meal here. Make sure to make reservations. Perhaps the only way you can walk in without one is if you go for dinner at 5pm. 
We always get the grabong (squash fritters, $12.50) to start, and always wish we'd ordered one for each person. The garlic tamarind dip is magic. It's stupidly good. I often get the gaeng masaman with braised beef ($15), as well. I ask for it mild, and I inhale the whole thing far too fast.
The Gaeng Kiaw Wan (served in a coconut, $18) is also really good. You choose the meat you want in the green curry, and you eat it from a coconut. Come on, why are you still reading this? Just go to Pai already.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nasra A.,"The food is delicious! The restaurant looks small when you first enter but the dining area is much bigger than expected and there is a ton of seating to the right of the entrance. There is also an area in the back that I think looks like it leads to an outdoor seating area (I haven't sat out there but just by looking around), and it would be perfect for large groups/parties! I've been here a couple of times with friends and the drinks are fantastic and the food is so lovely and flavourful. The price point is also wonderful given the portion sizes. Favourite items: pad gra prow, skewers, beef noodle soup, and the papaya salad.
Also, both of the times I have visited for dinner on a weekday with no reservation but was seated pretty quickly even for a party of four. And their menu can accommodate gluten free and vegan diners too with a ton of options.,  Can't wait to return :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole S.,"Pai is good if you order the right dishes and arrive at the right time and on the right day. 
It's extremely busy, which is not my favourite part about the restaurant. This business affects the service, naturally. You won't get water refills when you want them. I've had waiters accidentally spill curry on me while dining there... again, I don't like busy restaurants for a reason. 
Expect to wait over 30 minutes if you arrive after 5 PM. There are tones of amazing Thai restaurants in Toronto. So if it's packed and you have to wait, don't be afraid to try some other spot. I like Si Lom Thai a LOT. 
The food here is catered towards Western preference. It's very, very, very sweet. 
I'm not sure if the cuisine for Pai is less noodle oriented for a reason because I don't really see dish consistency on their menu. Don't expect too many noodle dishes here. 
Of all the dishes I've had, I'd recommend the Penang Curry. It's the best dish on the menu. I've had the Masanang curry, but it was awful one time and great another time. Sometimes the servings are smaller than others. 
The squash fritters are pretty good too. 
There isn't anything else on the menu I'd recommend. The food isn't particularly exceptional, so I'm not sure why it's such a popular spot. 
This restaurant lacks consistency, but on a good night the food is pretty good. I wouldn't jump to recommend Pai, since there are plenty of other amazing spots for Thai in Toronto.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gemmy A.,"Not like this place needs any more help from my review, but it really is amazing. The flavours are so rich it's near impossible to stop eating. if you're looking to down a bowl of rice - the broths here will make sure that you do. Sure the wait times are long but they do text you when your table is ready so you can explore the surrounding area without worrying about missing your spot in line. 
Be sure to try the squash fritters appy and their Khao Soi dish (IMO the vegan version is better than the original but they're both spectacular). 
Can't wait to come back to try all their other dishes!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Far K.,"I came here over the summer with my friend, and we both really enjoyed the food. Although it was a Wednesday late afternoon there was a huge line! We waited over an hour to get a table. 
However, it was worth it. The foods is amazing. We tried the green curry and pad gra prow. Both were super unique, and the presentation was beautiful. Pai is very different from regular thai places like Salad King, Sukho Thai, and Khao San Road. It has a authentic flavour that is very different and tasty. 
They have excellent vegetarian options, although the portion sizes are small for the price. Will be visiting again soon.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sakchai R.,"This was our first time in toronto and being Thai decided to look for a Thai restaurant. We found PAI and wow!! 
What can i say other than simply awesome. The food as well as tasting amazing came in huge portions, so it pays to be wise when ordering. Just a quick note, the restaurant ​gets extremely busy so be prepared to wait. But trust me.... Its worth it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,V M.,We had dinner here. Tasty food and with a happy atmosphere. Servers were friendly. Many regulars from my observation.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sepy B.,"When my brother told me we were going for Thai food, I certainly didn't expect the awesome atmosphere found at Pai! 
Super cool room, lots of awesome decor to take in, like the hand carved Muay Thai Barrel (see pic!) The staff was super friendly and helpful, answering our questions and helping us decide what we wanted to eat (thanks for the great service, Nicole!) 
The food.... oh my. I honestly haven't had such a unique Thai food experience before. My buddy was spot on when he called Pai ""extremely hip in comparison to other Thai places.""
We had the chicken wings, shrimp, green curry, crispy pork rice, shrimp chips... everything was incredible. Fresh, not too spicy, great textures, brilliant sauces and insanely flavourful noms overall. Even the drinks were amazing... try the Lemongrass Iced Tea and the Thai Iced Tea if you're in the mood for something non-alcoholic!
Really amazing lunch today, thank you Pai, thank you Nicole, and thank you to my brother's friend who said ""if you go to Toronto, you have to eat at Pai.""",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brenda T.,"I've been here a few times now and this place never disappoints! Well, aside from the occasional long wait to get a table because it can get pretty full in here... Make sure to reserve your seats ahead of time. 
The atmosphere is so hip and relaxed. Prices and portions are fair. They really try to give you a nice little Thailand feel with the restaurant's neat decor. The coasters for drinks even have elephants on them. So cute. I always order the Chicken Pad Thai because it's my favourite! I absolutely love Thai food and tend to order a Pad Thai wherever I can, and I have to say Pai is one of the best places to get it in Toronto. Lots of flavour that just hits the spot! 
Came here again the other day just to eat and drink with some friends. The food was on point and tasted amazing as usual. We ordered about 7 rounds of soju bombs for the 3 of us (lol)! It comes in a set of 4 shots for $16 - pretty good deal, and didn't taste so bad either. We all had a good time! 
I would DEFINITELY recommend this restaurant if you're into Thai food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tim L.,"Delicious fresh fantastic!...are the 3 words I would use if only allowed, but seriously this spot is ON POINT...i may easily be back soon...and would go slightly out if the way for a swoop n scoop on some dang dang...some good good, super delicious cuisine at a fair to moderate price",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ilan V.,"Pai is one of those places I don't mind going to over and over again. The food is great, the vibe is chill, and service is decent. Overall, Pai is a go-to for a good dinner when I don't want fine dining but want some good food.
I usually, without fail, get - Thai Iced Tea, and the Gaeng Masaman with braised beef and/or the Khao Soi with chicken. Both dishes are bursting with flavour and texture. I would also recommend the Grabong as a starter; the fried squash fritters just go well with that dipping sauce. I will admit, I'm a fan of tamarind, which might explain why I enjoy the Grabong sauce and the Gaeng Masaman so much.
I have had some sub-par experiences with some of their other dishes, but as long as I'm ordering what I like, I always enjoy my time (and food) here. 
Overall, I would recommend Pai to anyone looking for a laid back, casual restaurant with delicious food bursting with flavours. It helps that the pricing isn't ridiculously expensive either.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ian C.,"Pai has the best Thai food in the 6ix area! Their Panang beef is super creamy and goes super well with white rice! I also recommend their coconut fried shrimp, it is super light and crispy, and the sweet and sour dipping sauce is the perfect match!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,waeza s.,"Pai is one of my favourite restaurants in the city.  Grabong, the garlic shrimp, gaeng panag and pad cha hett are my faves.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maggie P.,"I've always enjoyed Thai food but Pai has brought it to another level for me! It is a really popular spot, and it was super busy both times we were here for dinner. I've only been here a couple times but I have definitely become a fan. 
So far we had the northern thai sausage platter, green curry with chicken in a coconut, khao soi, gaeng masaman and pad thai. Everything is super delicious but my favourite so far is definitely the khao soi - it's so perfectly creamy! And beware of the green curry - for someone who loves spicy food, the foreigner spice level was almost too spicy! 
The restaurant is a bit dark and it's hard to see what you're eating, but everything is great otherwise.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lori K.,"Best pad Thai I have ever had. Ever. 
Loud inside due to music. Super busy- even at 3 pm.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jes S.,"Okay so I was wrong about this place.
As a huge khao San road fan, I was disappointed over the khao soi I had here a year ago. Since then I have always refused to eat here. In my opinion the khao soi has a too strong coconut flavour.
Today however I got the beef curry and loved it so much! I got it foreign spicy and it was really spicy ! I drank 5 glasses of water to help with the spice levels, but adored the flavours in the curry.
My friends got the pad gra prow, and the beef noodle soup and also enjoyed their meals. For extremely picky eaters, this should say something.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anthony L.,"Amazing food, get the skewers? grabbong and khao soi. This place is so good. Also grab a reso hard to walk in cuz it's so popular.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve R.,"The food here is off the hook! I saw the other reviews and tried to visit but it was too far from my hotel. Luckily, I had a meeting nearby and stopped in for dinner. The atmosphere is cool and the food is delicious. It reminds me of my favorite restaurant in Sydney called Home Thai, which is the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand and this is a great runner up. 
Whatever you do, plan to go early in your visit to Toronto because you'll be tempted to plan a second trip. I know I wish I could have!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin L.,"Wow! What a great find on my last night in Toronto. Tired of eating my own cooking, i went on a walk about and found this unassumingly named restaurant with a modest front. I stepped in to find a line waiting a 5:45pm for a seat. The place is in the basement of a larger building and was packed. Once i ate my food i understood why. Balanced flavors with great Thai seasoning and spice. The cool Sapporo beer hit the spot, too.  I ordered the PGB Moo Grob with pan seared and fried pork, jasmine rice, and a large fried egg on top. Make sure you pour the fish sauce on top. Fantastic. Thank you for a great end to my trip!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Juliana N.,"HOLY. SH**. I'd give this place 10 stars if Yelp had the option. Come here if you want your mind blown away because that's exactly what happened to me. 
I came here super hungover from the night before and had no idea where my friends were taking me for lunch. I was way too hungover to care to even look at the menu so I just told my boyfriend to order for me (which is extremely unlike me). He got me the pad gra prow w/ thai crispy pork and got himself the green curry chicken with noodles. It didn't look like anything special to me so I thought it was just normal thai food. Boy was I wrong. I took my first bite and was SO blown away. I forgot that I was hungover and nauseous and devoured everything. I took my boyfriend's food, I took my friends' food, if I could I would've tried the whole menu. 
All my friends are from Boston and I think we can all agree that we would suffer the 9 hour drive to Toronto just to eat at Pai again. Bravo to the owner(s) and chefs. No thai food will ever taste the same. 
I will be back to Toronto one day just to come here to eat.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fiona L.,"Pai is delicious. The staff are pretty friendly for the most part, I understand that it can be stressful at peak hours so I still don't mind giving five stars to Pai. The atmosphere is great, especially if you're into the grunge-y, slightly crowded, and constantly upbeat/loud environment (I love it, personally). I'm never going to stop eating at Pai because it's delicious and serving sizes are big. Prices can be a little high but I think it's totally worth it and a good treat. Till next time, thanks!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Natalia K.,"One of the best Thai places in Toronto! Try any dish, they are all amazing! I love their pad thai",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hiro L.,"Food and service were both amazing. Had the authentic taste of northern Thai food and definitely lived up to the hype. Would have personally liked a little more heat in my food, I give it 4 stars because most of the food tends to stay on the savoury sweet side. A little more invigorating spice would have satisfied my pallete a bit more.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linda Z.,"Wow. I'm surprised I haven't discovered this Thai restaurant earlier...! My best friend said it's her favourite Thai restaurant in downtown so I decided to give it a try. We made a reservation for 9pm on a Saturday and they seated us a few mins after 9. There was a huge line up waiting for a table so I recommend making a reservation beforehand. 
I ordered the green curry and mango sticky rice for dessert. A few mins later, we got our mango sticky rice.... Not sure why they brought us our dessert before the main course but oh well I was hungry so I didn't mind. The mango sticky rice is literally a piece of mango on top of some sticky rice. It tasted good but not worth the price of $8.
My green curry came in a coconut shell. The coconut was too small to hold all of the curry, so they put the extras in a separate bowl. It was flavourful and had a lot of chicken and veg. After I finished the curry, I scraped off some of the coconut meat to try. It was really good! 
Service is great. The waitress we had was awesome and attentive. Came to check up on us frequently just to see if everything was ok.
I would totally come back for some more curry!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amed H.,"It was crowded on a Wednesday evening but the food was well worth the wait. I had fresh coconut water which was amazing along with a bottle of ginger beer. I also had shrimp with Penang sauce and sticky rice. 
I could go back again two days in a row. 
I think I might!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carly M.,"Hands down one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto. YOU NEED a reservation weeks in advance (especially on weekends) if you're coming for dinner. There's always a lineup literally out the door whenever I go. 
Despite Pai being huge, their service is fast and their staff are incredibly friendly. Some must eat dishes include their classic pad Thai, Penang curry, spring rolls, and mango salad. The portions are very hefty. I often order a bunch of dishes with the group I'm with and we share. For a party of 4, I usually order 2 apps and 3 mains and we don't usually finish every bite on our plates. 
The restaurant is very cool inside - very King Street west vibe but in a good way. The ambiance positively contributes to the atmosphere. 
Lots of good variety for different dietary restrictions. 
Note: I am not sure if they have an alternative way to get into the restaurant but when you enter there is a small flight of stairs that may be challenging for those with accessibility needs.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paz A.,"I've been here before and so excited to bring my son as he loves pad thai and I want him to try this. We enjoyed all that we ordered! We had the Thai ice tea, grabong of squash fritter, shrimp pad thai, gai satay, pad gra prow pork and oxtail. Yummy to our tummy. A bit pricey for so worth it!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raj R.,ordered via Uber. Really bad. Watery curry. Used to be best in Toronto. Quality has gone.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jimmy L.,"1. Always make a reservation a few days ahead of time unless you're cool with waiting 40 minutes in line.
2. Very very cool vibe -- I mean, it's underground and it's very beauuutifully decorated.
3. The oxtails are to die for (although I heard they don't serve it anymore). The khao soi and green curry (served in a coconut) seem to be fan favorites. But regardless, please be more adventurous and don't order pad thai.
4. I'm not a sweet tooth, but my friends all seem to enjoy the mango sticky rice.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Faye A.,"I cant believe I've never written a  review for this spot, they definitely deserve it! I have never had a bad experience coming here, I've been here with friends, family, a date, and they've all been near perfect experiences!
Food (5/5)- this food is the bomb.com (excuse my antiquated terminology, but it's exactly how I feel about it). Pad thai, delicious. Khao Soi, out of this world. Green curry, bomb. Thai Iced Tea, addictive! You can literally not go wrong ordering, everything is top notch. And I've been to Thailand, this restaurant would be successful there or anywhere else really!
Service (4.5/5)- it's always great service, very kind and helpful with the menu, but it's always a busy spot so dont expect regular checkins, you do have to wave someone down when you need something (not much of a complaint, I'm glad such a good spot got so popular, they deserve it).
Vibe (5/5)- I love the energy in here, since it's always busy, it always feels upbeat and lively. I love the busy decorations, I sometimes walk around and read the story about the owners or about Pai in Thailand.
Tips- be ready to wait to be seated (15-30mins), but believe me when I say it's worth every minute waited!
In conclusion- must go!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tisha D.,It's really good for northern Thai and tastes very authentic. Price not to steep so totally recommend.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Johan M.,"This place is definitely worth checking out. Pai is situated in the heart of Downtown Toronto and is only a few blocks away from the CN Tower. The vibe is unbeatable. 
I've had better khao sois tbh, but it was pretty tasty. The wings were delicious. I would be back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa C.,"Such a cozy little restaurant in the heart of downtown. The food is great, and I've always had really friendly service with the waiters/waitresses always ready to help.
This restaurant gets booked up fast so either be ready to wait in line or make a reservation in advance.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leisa H.,Very good food...CSR are on point very attentive....order anything all done perfect....book before you go,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angry T.,"I've been here a couple of times and it's safe to say that Pai is one of the must go Thai restaurants in town.
However, the Khai soi, one of their signature dishes really fell short today. The entire dish was off, different from what I had in previous visits. They skimmed on the sauce and noodles. The beef portion was on the generous side but they were very dry and hard to chew.
Perhaps I should have ordered that dish at Khao San Road (their sister restaurant) instead.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,N P.,Always amazing tastes and flavours. Pai has been consistently great through the years.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Siobhan G.,"Me and my partner came in for dinner on a Sunday evening. During the dinner rush I have waited around 15 minutes at most - they have a bar inside area where you can grab a drink and wait. 
The ambiance is trendy, bumpin' and busy, playing 90's music. The place is surprisingly big yet cozy with cool decor. 
We got the Som Tum Tad (Papaya Salad) with Dried Shrimp ($14) and Gaeng Panang (red curry with chicken) ($16). The papaya salad was sweet yet refreshing, coupled with salty chewy dried shrimp with sinful pork rinds and shrimp chips on the side. The curry was creamy and delicious. 
It's worth mentioning we've been here multiple times and the Gaeng Masaman with braised beef ($16) and the Pad Gra Prow (fried ground meat with chili oil and a fried egg) ($16.5) are our top 2 favourite dishes here. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu--it's all good. They have several items on their menu that can be made gluten free or vegan.
The service is solid - it doesn't feel pretentious to me like a lot of establishments in the surrounding area and we didn't need to wait long to get the bill once we were finished. Dishes are a little on the pricey side compared to other Thai places, but I always leave feeling full and satisfied. My biggest problem is that I can't try every item on the menu at once.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Barbara D.,"Super crowded, sub-standard pad thai - but wonderful, cheerful, boisterous atmosphere nonetheless.
We arrived on a Saturday at 4:00 PM and it was very, very crowded. Make sure you book reservations prior to coming in, or you'll be waiting, especially if you're with a big group. Our group of 5 ended up sharing a table communally with another couple. No problem. Random, but note that if you're wearing jackets - there's no coat rack, from what we were told. So be prepared to stack your jackets and purses on whatever stool you can find.
I ordered the pad thai (with chicken) and the khao soi (with braised beef). Flavourful to a point, but without the usual tamarind kick that I've come to expect. It was perfectly average. The khao soi came with a delicious broth, but the beef wasn't as tender as I thought it would be. Overall, not the best pad thai or khao soi I've had (to be honest, those awards still go to Khao San Road). They weren't terrible, but they weren't the best. The community atmosphere makes up for the experience - while table spacing wasn't the best, we really enjoyed the decor and overall environment. 
For a pad thai and khao soi (at $15.00 each), I paid $40 with tax and tip.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Audreana R.,This is my second time in Toronto and my second time here. This is a great spot with a cool ambiance and yummy food! Not to mention the service is amazing as well. It's conveniently located in the heart of the city.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah J.,"My first time trying Thai food. I was blown away with courtesy, service, vibe and food! Great portion size, I shared both of my meals with 1 other person and it was enough.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle C.,"One of my favourite appetizers that I get all the time there is their GRABONG. It's basically deep fried squash and they batter it with a red curry paste batter. They also give us a garlic tamarind dip with peanuts. Definitely give it a try if you go to Pai! I usually get either their pad thai or their curry there. Both of those dishes are super authentic and I would say, their spice levels can be adjusted to your preference as well. I got medium spicy and I think I can definitely eat a little spicier. I might try Farang spicy next time for a bigger kick, but medium spicy level was definitely a comfortable spicy level. I got the GAENG MASAMAN last time and the portion was a little bigger than I expected, which is GREAT! My boyfriend got the CHEF NUIT PAD THAI and it was SO good! I 10/10 would recommend the pad thai there. Good nutty and sweet and sour taste too! The portion was large too! I Pai is still my go to Thai restaurant in Toronto for sure!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sreya G.,"A quintessential Thai place in Toronto. Reliable service and food options, with ability to change the spice level and make you truly sweat. Good atmosphere to meet with friends or coworkers but always make a reservation because they are packed all the time!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julieta R.,"I was in Canada for 24hrs and had to
Rely on reviews on yelp to get the best food possible while here. My cousin and I loved this place! I can say it has been the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to! Oh and let's talk about that peach sangria! It was way too much for 2 people but the price was so right we had to go in, it was amazing! It had peach,guava,wine and ginger so much more and it was amazing! We walked there after seeing the CN tower since it's very close by. Highly recommend this adorable place, it was busy very busy which in my
Book is a good sign! The wait was 10min and our food arrived very fast which was a very
Nice surprise.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicky N.,"Food was okay! Authentic Thai food, but you can find many good thai food under more reasonable price than Pai in other thai restaurants in Toronto! 
(I didn't try Pad Thai there tho, so I don't know if they have authentic Thai Pad Thai).",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie M.,"The best Tom yum I have had! Came here for lunch while in Toronto for few days, was a great experience. Were seated promptly, waiter was attentive. Sangria was so refreshing and lychee flavor gives it whole new dimension of fruitiness. Khao Soi was new dish for me, exceeded my expectations as hit all senses. Overall great place, worth checking out even if long wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aleeshia C.,"This is definitely one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto. The Green Thai Curry is so delicious. The dish is always really fresh and the portion is large enough to have by yourself and take home leftovers or share with another person. Another go-to dish I recommend as a side is the spring roll. It's a good size, and is always crispy and never burnt. 
Price wise, I'd say Pai is average-upper in pricing. My only real criticism is that the sweet and sour sauce that comes with the spring roll is more of a jelly that a smooth sauce. However, the whole restaurant is fantastic! 
Please note: This restaurant gets really busy, so make a reservation, call ahead, or order takeout.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Allison Y.,"I like the food in general, but I don't love it.  And it is too expensive.  Yeah, this pretty much sums it up for me.
I can't say I have eaten Thai food in Thailand.  I compare Pai to the food I ate at a Thai restaurant that was run by a Thai family.  A mom/auntie cooked in the kitchen, and daughter and son worked the store front.  A mini spice tray was placed on every table.  I am used to bold flavours and oiliness from Thai food.  And the flavours be complex and mixed together.  
My conclusion was Pai has the best Thai curry in Toronto - the right texture, the right balance of flavours.  Tom Yum Kung soup was excellent.  It is a treat; I recommend it highly.  The eggrolls and satays were good shareable starters.  The Chef Nuit Pai Thai had a lot of good meat and seafood in it.  As far as the noodle part, it was down to earth with rich flavours.  This dish felt like a home-style food to me.  Gaeng Masaman with Braised Beef had complex flavours, but I found the chef was heavy handed with coconut milk. I wished there was more acidity in it to balance it.  The Khao Pla Tawt was a deep fried fish fillets with house dipping sauces.  The sauces were delicious.  The fish fillets were fresh.  It was good.  It was also nothing more special than plain deep fried fish fillets.  Unless you crave fish, otherwise, I would suggest you to skip this one.  
I ordered a variety of spice levels, from mild to Thai spicy.  I asked for Thai spicy and foreigner spicy for the soup and the Pad Thai, respectively.  I was given a small plate of chilli oil for both.  The soup tasted medium spicy only.  Pad Thai was not spicy, even after I requested it to be foreigner spicy. Does Pai make the food Thai/foreigner spicy or not?  The rest of the food was at medium spiciness.  Please believe me, medium spiciness was mildly spicy.
Services was impeccable and friendly.  We were given the bill without we asked for it, though.  And please tell me it is the location and the staff, because Thai food should not be this expensive.  Our bill was $135 for 4 people, all in.
I like it here, but not enough to call myself a fan. So 3.5 stars overall.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gino B.,"We came here for dinner right after watching a show at the theater. The place was packed and yet the atmosphere is such that you can still have a conversation without shouting. 
The food is simply amazing. For starters we had some crispy delicious spring rolls, guy satai chicken skewers with curry and spicy dipping sauce. 
And for the main we had pad Thai with chicken or beef. The noodles were prefect, the dish had a fresh aroma that made it absolutely delightful. 
The prices are so reasonable for a place downtown. We'd definitely go back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Greg S.,"Completely blown away by this gem. It is no wonder that even with the sprawling subterranean layout there was still a line at 6:30 - although we were seated quickly.  
We had the spring rolls, pork satay, green chicken curry, beef curry - masaman and pad Thai. The green curry served in a real coconut exploded with flavor and has just the right amount of heat. The pork satays we awesome as well. It was all delicious. Do not miss this - although you may not want to eat Thai anywhere else besides Thailand afterward.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin M.,"Ohhhh yea. The meals I love the best are the one's that surprise me. After finding this place on Yelp, I ventured on over to see if I could walk in and grab a table. The place was jam packed and their was a decent wait, but luckily I was able to snag a seat the bar. The rest is history.
With old school r&b playing in the background, I ordered some fried spring rolls and vegetable pad Thai. While I was waiting I chatted it up with a bartender who gave me the low down on the restaurant as well as the area and where to go. After this great convo, the perfection on a plate arrived.
The spring rolls are absolutely delicious and dipping sauce was amongst the best I've had. I tended to think all Thai spring roll dipping sauces were the same, but clearly I was wrong. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on. Either way, the dish was excellent.
The Pad Thai now, best I've ever had aside from what I ate in Thailand. Not too oily, little sweet, perfect mixture of noodles and vegetables and perfectly seasoned. It really was delicious. 
The service was excellent and I loved the upbeat vibe about the place. This place is great for group gatherings and overall just somewhere to go have a good time. Definitely will be back here at some point, and you should go check it out too!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacqueline S.,"Arrived around 12PM on a Thursday and it was already packed. Had to wait for 1 hour (waitress took our number and said they would text us after a table was available) 
Food: 4.5/5
-I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and it was delicious. It has the right amount of sweetness and the veggies/nuts added a lot of texture and crunch to the dish. I wish there was more chicken though! 
-My friend ordered their golden curry - tried a bit of some and it was delicious. She enjoyed it very much as well :) 
Service: 5/5
The waiter was very quick to take our order. One thing I liked was that he always came by to ask how we were doing and consistently filled up our water glasses without us asking. 
Environment: 3.5/5
The place itself is quite crowded - especially during the lunch rush. I recommend going right when it opens to avoid the wait. Also, it's quite dark (located underground), and so there was barely any natural lighting.
Will go again :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dishan W.,"Not much else I can add to what's been said here. You combine their food, prices, location and overall atmosphere, Pai is hard to beat as a great dining option for not only the downtown core but Thai food in general in Toronto. 
Always an easy recommend, the line and wait is surely worth it! The last time I was here I discovered they had a whole other section at the end that's got a completely different vibe to the busy main restaurant. I just lucked out and got a seat there thanks to being there early to put our group's name down. 
Always my go to for good with a group when catching a show or just food in the area.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nadira A.,Best Thai food in Toronto! Would highly recommend  - a bit on the pricey side but worth it,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jinny B.,"We went on Wednesday 7pm on a very hot weather (32 degrees). It was 20 minutes wait for inside and no wait for patio, and as we were so hungry, we took the patio. Luckily it was under shade so i didn't die. 
Tried green curry in coconut with chicken ($16, 3.5/5), and the red curry with beef and rice ($14, 5/5).  Loved them both, especially the red one. 
The price is on the higher side, and place couldve been cleaner..  but I am craving them ever since! 
But from my experience, pad thai wasn't as great. So I will go back for the curry.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ali B.,"Very busy midweek at lunch...there's a good 15 minuet wait so keep that in mind. For appetizer, I ordered papaya salad which I didn't really enjoyed but for lunch we had two dishes. One fried fish and rice, as well as, Nuit Pad Thai...both delicious but I must admit I've had way better Thai food.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris C.,"This is hands down Toronto's best Thai food! Everytime we go , there is always a line ! Today we tried the personal Tom Yum soup and the Panang Curry and also the Khao Soi. These are always my go to whenever I visit Pai. The taste is very authentic and traditional and really gives you that homestyle food vibe. Needless to say , all three dishes were very rich in flavour and fairly large portions. For two people 3 dishes is plenty of food ! The Khao Soi is a must at this place and you're missing the best dish if you don't order this. Will be coming back again and again to satisfy my thai cravings.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah K.,"You can't go wrong with Pai! It's a great place to come with absolutely anyone if you want a more than average Thai restaurant! Although I do feel that their menu is a bit similar to their rival - Khao San Road but they do a better job at keeping up with the standard and quality over the years. Staff is always friendly, food is always hot and fresh! 
Food: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Staff: 5/5
Price: 4/5 (a bit pricey for the type of street food you are getting, but hey, you are in Toronto.)
Overall: 4/5",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna A.,"Decided to come here with my boyfriend after paint night, as it was close by and the reviews are awesome. Got here at about 8 and there was a lineup of people and a length waitlist. I was really craving Thai food, so we agreed to wait and see what the fuss was all about.
We got seated at the bar, after about an hour-long wait. We decided to get some drinks - their specialty sangria and a Thai beer. The sangria was sooooo good! I would have ordered more, but I already had wine earlier and didn't feel like tumbling up/down the stairs on the way out. I ended up getting the Thai iced tea at the end though...couldn't resist. 
The menu isn't very extensive, so it didn't take really long to pick our items. We ordered their spring rolls to start, the green chicken curry aka Gaeng kiaw wan (served in a coconut!) and the Khao soi. The spring rolls came out pretty quickly and we gobbled them down really quickly, as we were starving! They were delicious and so was the sauce that came with them. 
It took quite a bit of time for our mains to come out though. The place was packed though.. We were hoping our waiter/bartender would have come to see us after taking our orders, but he didn't make it back until after we were done eating our meals. That is the main reason why I'm downgrading this review to 4 stars. The bartenders that were making drinks all night in front of us were amazing. They were not only taking people's orders at the bar, but were pretty much putting on a show for us at the bar. It wasn't anything spectacular like fire, but I was really fascinated by their work.
Sorry, back to the food.. I've never eaten green curry, but was pleasantly surprised. I got it at the foreigner spicy level and had no regrets. It was the perfect amount of spice for me, although my boyfriend found it quite hot. There was a lot of chicken, so I got full pretty quickly. I tried the Khao soi and thought the sauce was delicious. I also really liked those crispy noodles that they give! We finished it with the Thai iced tea and everything was just great. 
Overall, the food was pretty good. I wish they had panang curry on their menu (my usual order in Thai restaurants), as I'm sure it would've been incredible. But, I'm glad I tried green curry, because it was delicious. Boyfriend found the Khao soi to be good, but no wow factor. Drinks were awesome. The bartending crew was amazing - super fun to watch and extremely kind. Our waiter was a bit M.I.A unfortunately.. Overall, not sure if I would come all the back here from Thornhill/North York, but it's definitely a great place for everyone to try.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gaddam C.,Amazing place and i like the Green Thai Curry here,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tana T.,"I love this find, the setting is underground hip. Tom yum Casaer, ginger mule and tasty noodles. I ran out of noodles but I packed that broth to go. Eating it later with my leftover rice from an Indian restaurant last night.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ainoon K.,"If you're looking for amazing Thai food in Toronto Pai is the spot for you. Amazing taste as well as decent sized portions for the price you're paying ($15-20 per entree). I went to Pai on a weekday evening and there was about a 30 minute wait. Wouldn't recommend this place for groups as it can be quite cramped and almost impossible to get a reservation. 
I tried the Pad Thai, Khao Soi and Thai Iced Tea and they were all amazing! I would highly recommend both dishes. Although the dishes are a bit pricey, the portions are big enough to have leftovers for later. This restaurant doesn't have a full halal menu like other Thai places downtown however there braised beef comes from a halal supplier so menu items like the beef khao soi, massaman curry and Chiangmai beef noodle soup are halal. Overall, would definitely recommend if you're looking for a nice and tasty meal downtown.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edwin N.,"Got here just before 6PM before the dinner rush. This place was packed! 
I ordered the Khao Soi with beef brisket ($15.50). Serving size wasn't very big but the dish was tasty with a creamy, curry/coconut-y soup. The beef brisket was soft and tender. Dish also came with some condiments. 
Service was good too, despite how busy it was, our glasses were consistently filled with water and waitress checked in on how we were doing after we got our food. 
Overall a good experience, thankfully with no long wait time with luck!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edwin Z.,"I went here with a friend on the weekend - it was difficult to find parking around here, but it was certainly worth it. Thank goodness my friend was there first, because the place was very busy and got busier as we came in.
I had the spring rolls ($8.50) and Chef Nuit Pad Thai ($15.50). I liked the spring rolls the most, although they never seem to give you enough of them in number. The Pad Thai was also great - I wish I asked for a bit less sauce on mine, but that's moreso my own fault.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sam M.,"We expected this restaurant to be busy on a Saturday night and it was! We arrived just after 7pm and there was a 20 minute wait. The restaurant is much bigger than it appears. The ambiance is awesome, we loved the decor and cozy feel.
We started off with cocktails-I had the Winter Dog and my boyfriend had the mule. We liked our drinks and loved the food. The appetizer, spring rolls, came out quick. The sweet chili sauce the spring rolls were paired with had the perfect kick! I had the fried rice with veggies and tofu, my boyfriend had the green curry. The green curry was presented in a coconut, which was cool! The portion sizes here are pretty big. 
I'm giving four stars because I feel like the service we received was lacking a little. Our server wasn't very friendly and didn't come check on us and forgot to bring the waters we requested. If she would have come back to check on us we would have definitely ordered a second round of cocktails. Overall though, this place was great and we'd come back next time we're in Toronto!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tina L.,"Wow !!!!!
Let's start with a thank you to our remarkable waiter  Eric. You were on point . You made our first experience at your resturant one to come back to. Now for the food . The food was authentic, full of flavours and a nice portion. The only reason why I didn't provide a 5 star is price range. A little on the high end if you ask me for what your getting. It still remains street food so it would have been nice if the prices reflected that as well. 
Example 3 chicken wings 6$
Main meal around 15-22$
Thai ice tea 5.50$ the most expensive I've paid in canada ( lots of ice in it ) 
Total for two with a shared dessert 70$ plus tip",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Britnee L.,"Love coming here when I'm craving Thai downtown. Everything that I've tried has been delicious with no complaints at all. 
Food: The portions are well sized and filling. All their dishes are full of flavour that leaves you craving for more. My most recent dishes were the Chicken Fried Rice ($11) and the Green Curry ($11). The fried rice doesn't look like much but you'll fall in love once you try it. The rice is cooked to PERFECTION - it's fluffy and actually looks like individual grains of rice (none of them stuck together at all). The portion is enough for two meals if you can stop yourself from eating it all! The green curry only comes in mild or spicier. It's so rich in flavour and packed with large pieces of chicken. They definitely don't skimp on the meats in all their dishes. I would highly recommend these dishes. 
Service: The entire staff is super friendly and efficient. They are always smiling and usually joking around. For how busy they get, the food comes out fast enough. By 12:05pm they will have a full house for weekday lunch so you will definitely want to get here by 11:40am especially if you have a big group. 
Atmosphere: It's super casual and laid back. I love their entire music playlist and can jam the whole meal long. It gets loud though since you sit pretty close to other tables and can hear everyone speaking. 
Tip: Curry in a Hurry is a preselected curry of the day that changes each day. Costs $10 flat and is takeout only. Well worth it especially if you're in a rush. I was in and out within 5 minutes. 
Overall I would definitely continue coming here. Try everything on the menu!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Saule U.,"I love Pai. One of the best thai places in the city. Their Tom Yum soup is bomb! Highly recommend!
The only thing is that it is always busy, so prepare to wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Umber A.,"I went to Chang mai back in December and went on a frenzy looking for the best khao soy. After coming back from Thailand I didn't realize I would find the second best khao soy in Toronto. Big bonus is that the food is also halal! Great ambiance, awesome service!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria S.,Siwat was a great server! He was efficient and provided us with amazing and fast service. The food was served so fast and everything was delicious. 10/10 recommend:),5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Annie B.,Love! Love! The food here! Love how the green curry comes in a coconut and you can eat the coconut meat. Also the papaya salad can be ordered with raw crabs and it's one of my favorites! Super spicy! If you come early you can get a seat quickly... You can't go wrong with anything! We love coming here everytime we are in Toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel N.,"Pai is a fantastic restaurant, practically hidden away underground on Duncan Street. The atmosphere is lively and booming! I was shocked at how busy they were on a Sunday at 3:30p, especially since they just opened at 3p. Despite how busy and packed they are, Pai doesnt seem to be short on seats with two large seating rooms. We were sat in a clausterphobia-inducing corner, (but to be fair all the seats and tables are all stuffed close together) and left with the menus. Staff are friendly and honest, they were very upfront on dishes they'd recomend and ones they never would lol, but it was appreciated. We ordered the Gai Satay skewers, Thai Chicken Wings, and Hunglay Oxtail curry, which all came out in pretty good timing considering how busy they were. The Hunglay Oxtail curry is AMAZING, so rich and the oxtail flavoring was delicious. The Thai Wings were really good, but I felt 3 wings per order was too little of quantity considering the price. All in all I really enjoyed Pai and would definitely visit again, they only lost 1 star because the seating is a fire-hazard waiting to happen lol.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily N.,"I don't even know where to begin on Pai. I've recently moved to SF, but literally every visit back to Toronto... I will make a purposeful stop to get myself back to Pai to inhale the Pad Gra Prow. Everything else I've tried is also great but I could write you a poem on the Pad Gra Prow..I first tried it for lunch one day since I used to work nearby, but since then I've eaten it for lunch, for an afternoon snack, for dinner, for a late night meal... and everything in between. It's delicious and such a great proportion of food. I never leave feeling hungry or unsatisfied. It's the perfect ratio of protein to rice and the side veggies and egg are a great compliment.
Aside from my love of PGP, the lychee sangria is a fav of mine at Pai.. along with the fried spring rolls and papaya salad. 
Ambiance and vibe of the spot is also authentic and rustic which adds to the whole experience. Only thing I will say is that the lines are longgggg... I have never been able to snag a reso even tho I hear they exist... but I will continue to come back and wait in line for Pai's food forever.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine M.,"Incredible. Best meal of our week long trip. Pad Thai was filled with fresh veggies and delicious shrimp. Kao Soi was the best ever according to our son. Garprow was fantastic and flavorful. The Sangria was SERIOUSLY the best we've ever had. I'll be craving that for awhile. We tried to get another reservation during our trip because we liked it so much, but were unsuccessful due to its popularity and incredible food. Cool place and good vibes here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David P.,"Really trendy spot that feels ""cool"". The curry dishes are excellent and they have a casual vibe with great food! Do book ahead so you don't get stuck outside waiting for a table if you can. 
The wait can be a little long if you don't hav anything booked, but worth the wait!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nick B.,"If I had to eat nothing else every again but Pai's Pad Thai, I'd be just fine with it. I order it Foreigner Spicy and it's got just the right amount of heat and flavour. Often, because it's a busy joint, I just get it from Uber Eats, but the actual place is definitely cool.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew K.,"My favourite Thai spot in Toronto.
Excellent service and even better food, all at a very reasonable price.
I highly recommend the grabong (buttercup squash) to start, it never disappoints.
Can't go wrong with any main here.
The sangria is great, not too sweet but had alot of flavour.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Judy N.,"My second time here after trying it out last summer and it's just as good as I remembered! Hands down, one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the city. This place is always packed no matter what time you go but the great thing is they take reservations (unlike Khao San Road). The atmosphere is always loud and lively, the decor is new with a rustic feel, built like you're inside a hut. For the most part, there is either communal seating or tables fitting 2-5 available. However, they do have a private party room if you're looking to host something with a bigger group. 
Onto the food,
Chef Nuit Pad Thai w/ Chicken ($15) - Honestly one of the best pad thais out there.   Everything about this dish is perfection. Filled with simple ingredients and mixed with the right amount of sauce, you get an explosion of flavors that'll have you thinking about it well after the meal. It's a good portion too.
Khao Soi w/ Chicken Breast ($15) - I don't think anywhere can beat Khao San Road's khao soi but this one is quite up there and I would highly recommend ordering it. It's very filling as they give a substantial amount of meat and egg noodles. The crispy noodles add an extra dimension to the dish but the highlight is still the golden curry. I was so tempted to order an extra bowl of rice or wished there was bread to eat with the curry just so it wouldn't go to waste.
Khao Pla Tawt ($14.50) - They make fried fish really well here as it's perfectly crispy without being too oily. Comes with tamarind sauce and chili sauce to dip along with a bowl of white rice. I preferred the tamarind sauce more because I felt it complemented the fish a little better.  It's not a bad choice but I found it a bit boring to just eat fried fish with rice. And so, I would recommend the next item below: 
Fried Fish w/ Green Curry Sauce and Rice ($13) - Get this if you come for lunch since it's not on the dinner menu!! Pretty much exactly like the Khao Pla Tawt with the exception of the two dipping sauces and instead, you get green curry. I'm not sure why but they only have the Khao Pla Tawt in the evening but I much prefer this one. I can't remember but they probably only give 3 pieces of fish instead of 4 and portions are inevitably smaller but it's much more flavorful. Pour the curry over the rice, have it with the fish and voila.
My only complaint was the amount of time it took for the food to come out. I think we waited almost 30 minutes so I did get a little antsy since I was starving. But all that was forgiven and forgotten after I took a bite.
Pai is a must-try!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jill S.,"We love Pai. Everything is amazing.  We have been there many times for lunch (quick, authentic, cafeteria style with Thai street food) and for late night dinner.  They are always super busy but the food comes out quickly and the servers are great.  And the best of all, our favorite Singha Beer is now on draft!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Evanna L.,"It's been awhile since I've given a 5 star rating to a place. The service was wonderful, she kept checking back on us if we were doing good. The food was excellent!!! I think I stuffed myself too much and I was full for days. 
God for the curry and the pad thai! It comes in a coconut!!!
The place doesn't seem that big from the outside, but once you enter the place, they have two separated rooms. One massive room for parties! I love the decor, I love the atmosphere. Although it's a little bit tight in there, the couple next to us was clearly not pleased they have to sit pretty close to us. She wanted to move to a ""quieter"" place but the place was pretty packed so they couldn't move, and the girl was pissed. But seriously? 
Overall, I love this place, I didn't noticed it while I was there but the music was pretty loud, I was wondering why I was running out of breath while I'm literally screaming across the table. 
I will def. come back for more!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cherie F.,"Pai doesn't disappoint! Came here for the second time and ordered:
GRABONG (4/5) 
(Vegetarian deep fried battered squash fritters with a garlic tamarind dip)
This was delicious - I'd like to think that these squash fritters are a healthy version of fries haha. Its crispy and sweet - will order this again.
TOM YUM NAM SAI KUNG MOR FAI (4/5)
(A savoury, spicy and sour shrimp soup with lemongrass, coriander and green onions. Served with jasmine rice)
I love tom yum soup - last time I only got a small bowl so this time I decided to order the tom yum soup + rice as the main. Loved it! The portions were huge!
GAENG MASAMAN with braised beef (3/5)
(Braised beef in a peanut, tamarind curry with potatoes and topped with deep fried crispy shallots. (contains shrimp paste) with rice)
My bf got this one - we asked for mild for the level of spiciness (for the curry) but it was still really spicy. Yummy nonetheless.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kathy M.,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday. The wait time was not bad, but as we were leaving there were many groups waiting at the entrance. 
Service is quick and friendly. Servers are always refilling your glass with water, especially needed if you're having lots of spicyness!
We ordered a shared app of the grabong (deep fried squash). A good sharing size portion for 2-3 people. The garlic tamarind dip that comes with it is also very tasty! My fiance ordered the green curry and that came in a coconut (very cute idea). What i liked was that his curry was overflowing and all the chicken was not inside the coconut, so they served some more curry and chicken on a side dish on the side! The portion of this is quite fair and the taste is quite tasty.
I ordered the khao soi with chicken breast and the curry is sooo flavourful. It comes with noodles inside but definitely not enough. I saved the rest of my curry and brought it home to have with rice the next day. Definitely generous with the chicken breast though. 
Though the reason why I am not giving this place a 5 star is because of the price. Any thai restaurant in downtown seem to be a little high in price. Our meal came up to almost 50$ and we didn't even order alcohol! I guess being an asian, I always expect asian food to be slightly cheaper in price. But definitely a place to check out!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael S.,"After reading raving reviews about Pai, my partner and I decided to give this a try on a cold weekday afternoon.
We arrived right when they opened and was promptly seated, and boy, did the place fill up quickly. (Be sure to make a reservation if you are arriving during the busy lunch hour.)
There was a vibrant atmosphere in the restaurant, but it is quite dark. The tables are somewhat closely packed together so be careful when you are walking around!
My partner ordered the Khao Sao and I ordered the Pad Thai.
 * Pork Pad Thai with medium spice *
 I have to admit, it didn't live up to expectations. I might not have had really good pad thai, but I could tell this wasn't it.
Presentation: 
- Served on a bamboo leaf with a side of chopped cabbage and peanuts. 
- Wasn't really blown away, nor did it look REALLY appetizing.
Taste:
- It was alright, and barely that. 
- The rice noodles were a tad tougher than I would have liked it, and it was really hard to pick at it. 
- The spice weren't really mixed that well. Hit a couple of pockets where it was really spicy.
- Maybe its just me, but I don't like the cabbage to go along with the Pad Thai. The crispiness of   the cabbage might go well with the soft pad thai for some, but they didn't match that well this time. Maybe the rice noodles were just too hard.
Price:
- In line with what other Thai restaurant charges in the downtown area. 
- Worth it? Maybe....not really. 
Overall, I would like to give this another try, but purely based on the name and hype of the place alone. Otherwise, you might be better off grabbing your Thai fix somewhere else. 
Cheers.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexis K.,"The Khao Soi was fantastic. The service and drinks were also great, especially the Spicy P cocktail. The decor and environment made it a great experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sheila C.,"WE GOT SICK. This was our first time at Pai and was extremely excited because of the amazing reviews we saw on yelp. During our meal, my food was delicious. I ordered the popular Khao Soi with drumsticks. However my friend had their green curry (vegan) and said that it was flavourless and was very disappointed. After about half an hour, both my friend and I started getting very nauseous, thirsty, and dizzy. Overall, we were disappointed. I took time to think about whether or not I wanted to write this negative review because their curries were flavourful and tasty (at least for my dish). However, I would not want someone to also feel sick after eating here. Be careful!!",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thanushan A.,"We came to Pai for dinner. There's usually a wait to get a table. I'd recommend coming earlier to put your name down. 
I ordered the Gaeng Hung Lai (ox tail) and the Sai Va Platter. The oxtail curry is pretty sweet. There's a lot of bones and the meat is quite tender off the bone. It was a pretty solid dish. 
I didn't like the sai va platter. It was a bit bland, but is okay for sharing. I wouldn't recommend ordering it.
I still would prefer the green curry with chicken. I ended up getting this because my friend couldn't handle the spice she ordered. This is the best and most consistent dish here in my opinion. I'd also recommend ordering the Thai ice tea. In my opinion these are the best two things at Pai. It's better than suko. I'd definitely return to try the khao soi.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelvin C.,One of the best Thai foods in Toronto. Atmosphere is great. Curries are great but not enough rice. Stir fried dishes are the best here.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ciara S.,This place gets crowded! We went for dinner on a wednesday night around 6pm and it was a 20-25 minute wait but i will say it was worth the wait. My husband left feeling like it was the best thai food he's ever had. I got the fish and he got the ox tails. We both thoroughly enjoyed the food and would recommend it to anyone looking to have a fantastic meal. Just make sure you make a reservation in advance to avoid the long wait.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tana B.,"While in Toronto for a week visit from the states we managed to hit up this place 2 times! Once sitting at the bar, enjoying the eclectic decor and another time for a late night dinner. Both times we got right in despite it being super busy and no reservation!
We enjoyed the Plum Mule and Old Fashioned as well as the Kung tawt sa-moon prai (fried shrimp), Pad Thai, Panang Curry (get with fish!), and the khao soi with chicken. Everything was truly delicious!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alana S.,"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend, and was surprised to see such a long line up outside! We thought it would be because it was Nuit Blanche, but the couple behind us explained that there was always a line every night. Waited 45 mins which is not bad, the place has a lot of seating. Food was great, my boyfriend enjoyed his coconut curry, but the fish was okay. The chicken skewers were delicious though! May come back to try other things.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Caroline L.,One of my favorite Thai places with authentic taste and ambiance.  Most dishes I've tried and amazing.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Monika K.,"Yum yum yum!!!! 
I loved having another piece of this pai !! 
I finally got to dine in. This place gets filled quickly
So reservations are highly recommended.   
You can sit at the bar or have your own table. The first time I say at the bar and the bartender, Peter, was friendly funny and made great drinks!!!!  But if you get a table, try to sit at the back and you can go shoeless!!!!  We sat on an elevated area and had to remove our shoes. We had comfy matts to sit on and the table was at a good height.  From the back you get a great view of the restaurant. The ambiance is an authentic casual Thai vibe with retro cool decor. 
The server was quick and knew the menu inside and out!!  
The food: chicken satay was yummy, but could have been more meaty....came with two sauces: peanut and cucumber!  Mains: green coconut curry was rich with flavours and the pad graw praw was nothing less. Spice was perfect !!!  Thai ice tea was smooth sweet and cold :) 
To finish: we had some simple jasmine tea. Whole experience was comfy and yummy :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erica D.,"Delicious food and cocktails! I ordered the green curry in a coconut! Aesthetically pleasing experience to eat out of a coconut and the curry itself was rich and tasty. It was very filling and you could definitely take some home for leftovers but I was determined to eat it all and scrape out ALL of the coconut at the bottom! YUM
 Great atmosphere with intimate lighting for date night or with a group of friends. Plenty of appetizers to share. The cocktails were delicious as well; classic cocktails with a Thai spin on them. Very sweet, so next time I would ask for less sweetness. Overall everything was great and the service was quick even when the restaurant was completely full.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Naveen R.,"This place is great! Its a nice little spot that is actually huge inside. We went on a Sunday night, and it was packed, but we still got a table within 15 minutes of getting there. The food we ordered, a pad Thai, basil fried rice, and green curry, were all really good. The service there was also fantastic and the people were so friendly. Lastly, the decot is so unique and different. I would recommend this place to anyone exploring Toronto downtown.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha M.,"Absolutely delicious!! Fantastic service, great food and drinks. The only downside is they don't take reservations so you'll likely end up in a line up to get in.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pushkar B.,"This is hands down the best Thai place I have ever been to. Mind you, at most times there is a line to get in the line but I assure you it's totally worth it. Once you are in you can't help but admire the ambience inside.  The detailing of the interiors captures you and oh my god  did I say how huge the place is, its like an endless cave.  
Bottomline - the wait time is totally worry it and if you like thai and/ or want to impress your new friend in town with a place this is a great place to go.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vii S.,"Go-to place for authentic Thai food. Offers different rooms with different decor and service. They also offer traditional sitting, which is a pretty cool experience if you've never done it and don't mind eating while sitting on the floor, shoes off. Be mindful that it is  always packed - but definitely worth the wait!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tbura B.,"Great Thai place in Toronto. The menu was designed very well. Some dishes were out as we were told they ran out of the ingredients that got shipped directly from Thailand. Service was so great and the people were so friendly. Nice suggestions on what to order. 
I voted for Moo Ping to be the best dish of the day. The others were so great as well. The flavor of some dishes got tweaked a bit from what could be found in Thailand just to fit well with people' appetite here.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shahin S.,"Great Thai spot just off of queen west. This place gets busy so be prepared to wait. 
Casual dining experience with friendly and efficient staff. 
I ordered the pad Thai and it was delicious. Tasty, good portion size and very flavourful. 
All in all a great dining experience.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nikita I.,"Went for lunch on a week day. The place was not that busy. Felt like i was in a tropical environment by the way the restaurant was decorated which really set the mood towards the amazing food I was about to eat.
The place was clean. The service was alright. The food was very tasty and flavourful. I tasted all the key notes you would find in a Thai dish.
The bottles of water tripped in out because I thought there were birds in the restaurant hehehehe. That was a cute and fun touch.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kesha T.,"Definitely worth the wait. I appreciated the love story of the owners. All of the photos and the creative posters and arrangements throughout the restaurant was engaging and made me feel like I was supporting a pretty cool couple. The line was out the door as we walked closer to the building, but I saw that as only meaning it was worth it...I was correct. The bar area was packed with friendly regulars and newbies from what I caught from various conversations. The presentation of all the cocktails were pretty. When we were finally seated, our orders were promptly taken. It took forever and 5 asks for my friend to get a Coke, which was disappointing, but I was accommodated well. I appreciated the paper straws. My shrimp pad thai was pretty much the best I've had. I've had pad thai in the past that would have too many peanuts or too much oyster sauce or just plain nasty. My pad thai was very fresh and absolutely heavenly. The shrimp were plentiful and a good size. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the ambiance.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelly H.,"I love every dish I've ever had here. 
If there are more than 12 people in your group, you can book the private dining room with a set menu.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,PoliPace K.,"Their pad gra prow is my favourite thai dish ever!!
I also recommend their Tom yum soup..it's the best I've ever had.
I even learned to make my own pad gra prow although it's never quite the same as I never have the proper thai basil to flavour it with.
Sometimes, their service can be slow and bad..but most of the time, they are good. It is bit loud there and crowded so I prefer to have a take out. Nonetheless, most of their dishes I have tried there are definitely true thai flavoured and authentic.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mitchell C.,Always a delight. Might take a bit to get a table but worth it. Staff are always super friendly. Food is always a win.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sam D.,"It's been years since I had a go to Thai place. We went to this place because of the hype and it was totally right! This place has great atmosphere and the food is fantastic. It's easily the best I've had since visiting Thai land. If you are craving Thai, this is your spot!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ayelet S.,We got pad Thai tofu and veggies and Khao Soi with shrimp. It was very good. Flavourful and delicious,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sancho H.,Food was super yummy and authentic. The tom yum soup was packed with flavor. The pad thai was solid as well. Only complaint would be that the beef in the green curry was slightly dry but the curry itself was good. Overall great spot for thai,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eric F.,"Hard to find really good Thai food in Toronto. This was my first visit to Pai, but I was impressed. Cool atmosphere and great food! 
I like spicy food, so I ordered my Pad Thai ""Thai spicy"". For once, it was actually hot! They don't mess around with the heat here, so if you like hot food be sure to order it Thai spicy for an impressive, endorphin inducing kick.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jaymin P.,"Almost 5 star experience. Removed one star because their menu offer d spice level customization but was not offered when asked.  Red curry was slightly sweeter and extra hot sauce provided on side was not enough. 
Ambience is top lnowtch almost walking into some underground clubs scene. It was filled with people waiting for table.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tara J.,"The food here is so good - now I see why they have long wait lines! Luckily, I got a seat at the bar within 15 minutes since I was by myself.  The spring rolls are kinda spicy and very good. I cannot remember the name of the dish, but it was egg noodles in a coconut curry broth with braised beef, topped with crunchy wonton noodles and scallions....the best meal I had during my weekend in Toronto!!! The broth was super flavorful and the beef was so tender...I'm still thinking about it! :-)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mo F.,"We were there on a Saturday evening. It was super busy, had to wait 35 minutes to get a table. There is a cozy corner inside the restaurant for waiting, good for winter time. The waiting was worth it. Despite the extreme busyness, drink was served on time. I had ordered Tom Yum Caesar. It was a bit spicy and had the expected punch. Loved it. 
The food tasted great. We had tried Pad Gra Prow with chicken and Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. Both dishes were very flavourful. I order mine to make Thai spicy. Bad decision! It was super hot (spicy). If you can't handle spice but would like to try anyway then I would suggest you rather go for mild or foreigner spicy. The portion was moderate. The taste of both dishes were very similar to the same dishes in BKK Thai at North York where I am a regular. If you happen to be in this corner (just North of 401 on Yonge, North York) of the city, I suggest you also try BKK Thai. There food is equally good or better minus the crowd and waiting time. Anyway, it's not as vibrant as Pai and one tenth in size.
Overall the service was great. Can't ask for more in such a busy time. Glasses of water were served and refilled without asking. Highly appreciated the extra paper napkins on the table; proactive thinking - guests will need them specially if they try their food Thai spicy. I would love to go there again with a big group.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Helen W.,"Psi had the best Thai food I've ever had!! This restaurant was recommended to me by multiple people and I was blown away. The music was bomb, the food was even better and the drinks were spot on. This is a place I would recommend everyone trying!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mimi L.,"Not bad, but personally it doesn't add up to the hype for me. Everyone told me how amazing the food is but for me, the food is a bit too heavy for my stomach to handle. Location is tucked away in this underground ""hipster"" like area. Very packed! We waited approx. 20 minutes and wait staff was hard to call but totally understandable. The vibe wasn't very ""thai"" though; it felt very similar to Warehouse on Queen. 
I went with my boyfriend, I got the curry noodles and he got this extremely spicy rice dish (forgot the name of both but they were supposedly verh popular dishes) Also ordered a tom yum soup and a Thai milk tea. Dishes were served  pretty fast but the workers seem to be overworked :( . The curry noodles were delicious, came with fried crisps but after about 6 bites you get sick of it since it is very very rich. I packed the rest up. My boyfriends rice wasn't really interesting in flavor, just really spicy. He said the Tom yum soup didn't taste right either so he didn't end up finishing it. The milk tea was very very good though, edging on very sweet but overall would recommend.
Overall the experience was ok. We only stayed for 20 minutes after ordering since we couldn't handle the food, my boyfriend ended up getting sick from it when we went home. Would not recommend if youre looking for a light meal or if you have a weak stomach.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rabbiya A.,"We reached at 6 and added our names to their list. The wait time was an hour, so we left our contact number and went to a nearby place to grab drinks. We were seated within an hour and 20 mins. 
The ambiance and spirit of the place is cosy yet buzzing. It was super crowded yet everyone looked comfortable. 
We were told we may have to opt for communal eating and share our table but thankfully we ended up getting our own table. 
We placed our order based on reviews on Yelp. We ordered their Green Curry (Gaeng Kiaw Wan) and Khao Soi which had egg noodles with curry, crispy noodles and your choice of meat. We had the Green Curry with Chicken and it's served in a coconut and the Khao Soi with Beef.
The service was friendly and efficient. Our food came within 20 mins of ordering. The Thai Iced Tea complemented the food perfectly. 
Overall we had a great experience and I would definitely recommend this place!! It's definitely worth the wait and justifies the hype.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mona S.,"Amazing Thai food! Last time I had the khao soi with the braised beef, and the flavors were amazing. The service at the restaurant was also really good, even though they were busy they were very attentive. It gets busy and the wait for a table can be long, but I always have luck getting a community table.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah B.,Amazinggggggg. Can't wait to go back and try something else new and exciting on the menu!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Allyssa V.,"I love Thai food, but this restaurant exceeded my usual Thai expectations. My family visited from Chicago and I wanted to take them to some place special. And they wanted Thai, it was on a Monday and it's already packed! It says something about the establishment, that this restaurant could be really good  xoxo The server was really nice and polite! The food was excellent! We had an amazing experience, proud Toronto foodie here! I'm so happy that my family had a really great time. That's what important! Thanks PAI Northern Thai Kitchen!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Unaiza P.,"I've been to Pai more times than I can count, not sure what's taken me so long to write a review. I believe I've tried most of their dishes, all of which are superstars, but the most worthy ones are definitely the Thai chicken wings, khao soi, satay, fried squash fritters, and the green curry. Whatever you do, you must try the squash fritters, they are so delicious and the serving is pretty big. Fair warning though, they are addictive. The khao soi with braised beef (or any meat really) is also unforgettable, its a northern thai noodle dish with a coconut broth base - this might get a little messy to eat though, still its worth every stain. I love their chicken wings, they are not too sweet, and are flavored with essential thai ingredients like lime leaves and chillis, unmissable in my opinion. Pai is easily the best thai food I've had in North America, so if you haven't tried pai yet, for whatever reason - I hope this review is compelling enough!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angel J.,First time in Toronto and we saw that this place has so many reviews so we decided to try out this spot. The food was delicious. The dishes were so flavorful. It does get very packed but service was awesome. The waiters we're so friendly and attentive even though they were very busy. I would definitely recommend this place,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Scott M.,"A great Thai place, uncomplicated, simple, good food. Had the gaeng panang w tofu, delicious with some chili oil. Worth the wait in line.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Drew L.,"I'm very, very surprised by all the praise this place gets.. particularly when it is located in close proximity to Khao San Road, which is better in just about every regard.
Entirely mediocre in all ways.  Pad Thai was decent, still much better than something like Thai Express, but had no delicateness to it.. noodles clumped together and were overly firm/oily.  Red curry was sickly sweet and honestly on the verge of being unappetizing.
Also, something I haven't seen really mentioned here in the reviews, and I think is very important... is that you cannot edit the spice level of any of the dishes except the Pad Thai.  Yes, they'll give you a side of chili oil.. but that doesn't match a place that will tailor your order in the kitchen to the spiciness you want.  This is most evident with their Massaman, which has tons of potential, but is just way too sweet served as is (not 'authentic' at all, even though I keep hearing that adjective get peppered around on here). Even the Pad Thai, which I got extra spicy.. you could tell the actual core of the flavours of the dish were mild, then they just throw in more chilis...
tl;dr -- go to Khao San Road instead.. definitely a better Thai food experience, especially if you have a penchant for heat.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anh T.,"*4.5/5. 
*The noise level can get quite loud sometimes with the music and surrounding conversations, but it was never to the point I had to yell across the table.
*Service is CONSISTENTLY bad. The servers always seemed a little forgetful at times when we'd ask them to refill water or extra bowls. They were quite fast when we asked for the bill though. 
-Tom Yum Nam Sai Kung Mor Fai - $15
The soup arrived with a tiny fire at the bottom to keep the broth warm. The soup was fantastic and had a perfect blend of sweet, savoury and spicy. However for $15, there were only 5-6 tiger shrimps and chopped pieces of mushroom, thus I would say this dish wasn't necessary worth the $15 price tag and it would have been nice if fish was included as well.
-Gaeng Kiaw Wan (Green Curry) - $16
The green curry arrived at the table in a young coconut shell and you can scrape off the coconut ""meat"" from the inside. The curry itself was packed full of fragrant and aromatic flavors, and had the perfect consistency and richness. The chicken pieces were tender and soaked up all the curry flavors. Though it was quite spicy, there was just enough sweetness from the coconut milk to counteract the heat.
*Quick tip: Pay attention when you order any dishes that are being served in a coconut or pineapple shell (like fried rice). If the restaurant is cheap, they will reuse the shells!! However if there are still some ""meat"" or fruit in the shell. most likely they are freshly used :).
-Sai Ua Platter/Northern Thai Sausage - $14
I found the sticky rice to be on the dry side but the pork belly sausages were perfectly cooked. The greatest part of the dish had to be the relish that contained yster sauce and shrimp paste, with some intense flavors, binding all the components together.
-Squash Fritters: 
The fritters were piled high and it was not as sweet as sweet potato fries, yet still had the ""fries"" texture. They were light and crispy on the outside, and fluffy and sweet within, paired up with a nice tangy bright tamarind dip. 
-Mango sticky rice: 
Occasionally they would run out of mango and serve with a Thai custard instead, and I dislike it as the custard made the entire dish way too sweet. The mango that they use is a bit more tangy which complemented perfectly with the sweet sticky rice, however it would have been nice if they used incorporated black sticky rice for textures.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda S.,"Waitress put our orders in front of other nearby customers by accident, left it there for about 10 min and I saw the customers touch the food with their forks as they tried to figure out if it was the wrong order. The waitress came back and they said it was wrong so she took it back. She then walked away to a corner of the room and came back over to us (I guess thinking we didn't notice) and gave us the food. We confronted her and she admitted what she did and apologized. I was in such shock. Another waiter came over and apologized and they promised they were remaking the food. We were very hungry and trusted that they would remake it so we waited and the new plates were good. We ended up paying full price and tipping (looking back I don't know why I did). I probably won't ever eat here again after this experience, it makes me really worry about cleanliness and safety.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew K.,"My favorite Thai place in Toronto! We've come several times now, and in particular their currys are excellent. In this visit, I had the green curry, which is quite flavorful with coconut milk flavor, bamboo, and any protein you choose. This dish however isn't very large, so if you're hungry, the other curry dishes seem to be quite bigger. They are also excellent, particularly the gaeng masaman. Pai gets quite crowded at peak hours so reservations are quite necessary and the line often gets out the door. At times this causes the service to be quite average. However the food is absolutely delicious and keeps me coming back. Also pro tip, the door to enter is at the side of the same door to exit...the sign at front can be confusing, don't go around the corner looking for it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris B.,"We ate here on a Saturday, just before noon (it opened at 1130) and the place was almost completely packed.  Waiter and staff were all very friendly. The menu was fairly small from an entree choice perspective (decent choice of appetizers) but had a good mix. 
Since my wife doesn't tolerate chili heat very well she went with the Pad thai, because this could be customized to ""no spice"" level. I ended up getting the Khao Soi, because it is a less common dish in Thai restaurants I've visited, and I have wanted to try a good version of it. We also got Thai iced tea in an attempt to get some caffeine, since we didn't have coffee or tea that morning. 
Considering how busy it was, the food came out in a reasonable period of time. The Pad thai was more sour and less sweet than many restaurant versions I've had. I thought it was quite good, but would have appreciated some chili heat (but it was my wife's dish, so...)
The Khao Soi was much better than the other version I have had in WNY. The broth was more coconut-y and very rich, with a decent amount of heat for something described as mild. I did add more heat with the chili oil provided. I ordered mine with braised beef as the protein, and this was very good, much better than its appearance suggested. The beef looked to be cooked  separately and added at the end, and appeared fairly plain with little browing. But it was very tender and more flavorful than expected. I'm not certain which cut of beef it was, but it seemed like from beef shank, removed from the bone and cut into cubes. I would definitely order again, if in the mood.
The main downside is it took quite a while to get my check, maybe sitting there for an extra 10-15 min. Another worker noticed us sitting there waiting with our jackets on for while, so she did get our waiter to bring our check. They were quite busy so it is tough to hold that against them too much. 
 Will visit again if in the area. Next time, I would try the Pad gra prow as the waiter also suggested.  Definitely my type of dish and their version looks great",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew A.,"Amazing Thai Food for grabs, alot of well used seasoning and exemplary care causes the dishes they serve to be the utmost quality almost wishing you had a second order.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melissa S.,Always pleased with both the service and food. Highly recommend for anyone looking for great Thai food in west Toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,C H.,"Visiting from NY and was anticipating a great experience. So disappointing. Long long wait line while standing on a steep staircase. What?? Take names and let people wait outside or get a cocktail at the bar. Seriously strange process with no regard for the customers. 
Food was ok. Don't believe the hype about how fantastic and authentic the food is. It isn't. We ordered a sangria pitcher. Was quite tasty. Thai wings were good. Gai satay was good. TOM YUM KUNG was very spicy hot and uninteresting. Fried fish was good. Good food (3 of 5) Not great food.
Was so dark had to use my phone light to see the menu. 
Service: Strange. Appetizers were brought to us 10 minutes apart. Server was inattentive. (2 of 5)
Not the experience we had hoped for.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nickie R.,"My girlfriend and I loved this place! They got us seated in 15 minutes or so & then the magic began. She started with the Thai chicken wings which she loved. She also enjoyed her Thai iced tea. I got the Tom yum soup which wasn't bad, it was just a tad bit sweeter than I was used to, but still good. I got the Thai fried rice which was heaven and she got the green curry. This is a quality place for Thai food and actually a lot larger inside than it looks from the outside.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,C R.,"Let me just start by saying, the thought has crossed my mind to fly to TO just to come eat at Pai. I had absolutely no idea what I was eating, I just asked the gentleman at the back bar what was his fave and he suggested the pad gra prow (I think that's it) and I ordered a Tom yum (it had a little kick). Everything was sooo savory it was ridiculous. The wait was a bit daunting when they told me, but they make every effort to place you somewhere you can eat. Damn near on the roof. I have no complaints at all. My daughter got the fried rice she said it was delicious. Can't wait to come back. The cute story line decor and ambiance are also a ++ the pics will keep you busy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura R.,"We tried to come here for dinner on a Sunday night without reservations. Hahaha we couldn't get in! So since my husband heard it has the best Thai food in town, he purposely drove downtown to get take out. Food was great, very flavourful. Please start delivery to the High Park area! We would be your best customers! Uber eats or something of the sort? Something to think about!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yiming L.,It's hard for me to stop from ordering sticky rice with mango on every visit to Pai. It's a simple wonder with perfect balance of sweetness and sourness. I love the chewy texture of the sticky rice.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jasmine K.,"One of the best Thai spots in Toronto. Always busy so be sure to make reservation, come during non peak time, or in my opinion the best way to enjoy Pai - pick up using Ritual and skip the line! 
Pai's green curry is my all time favourite, the broth is delicious, creamy, and coconuty. 
Khao soi is also great if you want curry but also want noodles.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pradeep T.,"I have been meaning to write a review for this restaurant for quite sometime now. No matter what adjectives I use, I would be regurgitating the countless praises that have already been sung.
I have been here for more than 30 times till date and have tried all the dishes (barring beef and pork varieties). I am yet to experience disappointment - be it the service, dishes, drinks, the restaurant is top notch. The flavors are authentic and presentation is neat. Regardless of what you try on the menu, you will be impressed, and will be rearing to come back for more. I do. 
I had introduced this restaurant to at least 5 of my friends and they have all been fans. 
I just love the place and, needless to say, I will remain a fan for life!
A tip: if you are in the area for lunch, do stop by for a quick grab-n-go from the Market (11:30 am - 2:30 pm weekdays). It's a good option if you are a 'Thai Express for lunch' kind of a guy. You get a great tasting zero-wait-time lunch for a cheaper price.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paul G.,"My first time here from the US. This place is the best Thai I have ever had. SIT AT THE BAR! Irvin and the lady behind the bar were amazing. 
From food to drinks, to atmosphere, this place is one of the best vibes I've received in a restaurant. I 10/10 recommend and give this 5 stars all day.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex K.,Amazing eveytime. The kau soil is amazing and the service has been spot on every time. Order in or out. On point,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Robyn L.,"Been wanting to try Pai for a while, finally booked for lunch! It was super yummy - definitely try their thai iced tea. I got the wings to start and they were super moist and juicy. Spring rolls were fine, the moo ping was delicious, and the pad gra pow was excellent! My family and I were stuffed by the end. It was a bit loud and a bit dark, but otherwise a great lunch! Service was prompt as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anthony M.,"Fantastic 
Great spot  Great food and Great staff. 
If I am ever back in the neighborhood I will be back. 
Keep up the good work.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Misha I.,"Surprised I haven't written a review about Kai before today. This restaurant is one of my favourites. I feel transported back to Thailand every time I step in here. For some reason, I always thought they don't take reservations, so I've always been stuck in a long wait, but I saw last time that they do in fact have reservations on their website. 
My favourites are the Tom Yum Soup, Pad Thai, Moo Ping ( I could just eat 3 orders of these alone), Coconut Shrimp, Khao Soi, and Panang Curry - okay maybe I like the whole menu. 
They also have fun drinks like Thai Buckets, but don't be mistaken these aren't the authentic ones that give you wings! Haha.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John C.,"Pai northern Thai kitchen is a clean, respectful and professional business with one of the best noodles I've had",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew U.,"Very nice vibe, and the food was quite good. I continue my quixotic search for Pad Thai that is not too sweet, and this iteration was good, though still a bit on the sweet side for my taste. The Tom Yum soup, however, was absolutely extraordinary!  I got the ""medium"" level of spice, which to my taste was quite spicy, yet not ""hot"" - which was perfect, as far as I'm concerned. Staff were attentive and the food arrived fairly quickly, given how many people the place had packed in.
Only one negative, that keeps the experience from being 5 stars, was the fact that I was bumped into by multiple servers no less than 4 separate times during my meal.
Now I get that it's a busy place, and that they're trying to serve a lot of people, but the first time a waiter bumps into me while I'm sitting down eating my meal, it can be excused. The second time, it's a bit annoying. By the third, I just start to think that the wait staff is moving too quickly. By the fourth, I was just annoyed, and this detracted from the otherwise enjoyable quality of the food and the ambiance.  So get this settled. Either fewer tables, or train the staff to be a bit more graceful with their movement around the place. Because my the end, I felt like I was at a crowded bar at 1am with a bunch of rowdy drunks, and that's dissappointing.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexsa W.,This place was soo delicious. Exactly what my coworker and I were looking for on a cold fall day. It had a fun/upbeat vibe and great food!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rose N.,Good food. Nice vibes. The portions are a lot so beat to share if you go with a friend!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christen C.,"This restaurant is all quality. My favourites: pad thai, Tom yum soup and green curry. They're incredibly busy, but the waitress was always attentive when I grabbed her attention. I can't express just how much their food is so flavourful, filling and so worth it! Usually I wouldn't do delivery/take-out, but because they're so busy, I'd rather do take out just to get their food faster. 
I went on Halloween and all the wait staff wore very adorable costumes. It feels like a family in there!
Love it! I will be back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dee K.,"Delicious papaya salad, get medium spicy. Their crispy pork over rice is total comfort food with the perfect egg on top and lastly, don't forget to order their very authentic Thai sausage (so much lemongrass it's perfection!) happy eating!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carmen C.,"Book a reservation. This place is very crowded and popular. It's a trendy place with good food. If you don't mind bumping elbows with other people or sharing tables, this is a good place for fusion Thai food. 
I went with my friend for a summer dinner. It took us a few weeks to get a reservation. They are good in that they are punctual with their seating even when the place was full. The service was fast and friendly. The food was interesting and appropriately spicy. 
The place was recommended by my friend. It didn't disappoint. I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't feel very comfortable. There wasn't a lot of space. The table next to us was so close that they could examine what my friend ordered. The restaurant was very loud, so it's not a place to have long conversations.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Micayla S.,"Yay!! This place was everything I expected it to be and more. I was with a semi - large party on a Sunday night and the wait was a little over an hour, but it was definitely worth it. Take the opportunity to make reservations in advance to avoid the wait time! 
I ordered the braised beef khao soi. The broth was silky, the beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the noodles had a slightly chewy texture that I loved. 
Our waitress was the sweetest lady ever and was very attentive and knowledgeable. We threw lots of questions at her and you could tell that she knew what she was talking about! 
Try this place. It's fantastic!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Naomi H.,"JUST AWESOMEEE!  Everything from the wings to the spring rolls to the pad thai to the green thai curry, and everything in between was so beyond delicious.  This place is hopping, just packed, at all times of the day, and rightfully so!  The food is definitely something to make the trip and wait for.  I really want to go back tomorrow for another dinner, to be fairly honest!  Always amazing :) .",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jen W.,"Yay! Another bookmarked restaurant down! And it was so great. We came in at around 5:30pm and it was PACKED. They managed to squeeze us in, but I seriously recommend making reservations before hand.
PRO TIP: they do NOT take reservations on the day of.
Gai Satay (5/5) - AMAZING. Like genuinely the best thing we had at Pai's. I think the peanut was seriously something special--I've never had anything as great. They also came with these spicy pickles which were also ridiculously great.
Issan Sausage (3.5/5) - A smash hit with the rest of the party, but not with me. I thought the hot sauce was fab, but the sausage was pretty dry to be completely honest.
Fish Fillet With Tamarind Sauce (4/5) - Forgot the name of this one but it was great! Crispy and yummy and all around a good dish.
Massaman Beef Brisket (5/5) - BOMBBBB. So good!! Tender and flavourful, well rounded and super comforting.
Pad Thai (3/5) - Meh. Not impressed. Not much to say here.
We also got Thai iced teas which were great--everyone thought it was refreshing and just sweet enough. Give this place a try!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Olivia E.,PAI is always packed but for good reason - the food is phenomenal and the place itself is so cool. It's one of those places you are already excited to return to the second you step out the door. Definitely recommend -- maybe try going earlier to avoid wait times.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brian K.,"Love everything about this place. Atmosphere, food, decor, and service.
Bit on the pricey side for Thai food, but great quality ingredients and tasty.
Their beef salad lettuce wrap dish is off the hook.
Make sure to make reservation or be ready to wait in line to be seated",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victor L.,"My group was lucky to have booked for a table of 8. We had made reservations almost a month before and we're pleasantly surprised. Why you ask?
First, we swiftly seated in the hidden private room when we arrived. The main area of the restaurant was bustling and then I entered the private party room where you can fit around 20 ppl. The other group didn't arrive yet so the first part of the dinner felt like we were in an exclusive restaurant.
A few of us ordered drinks that many thought were unique especially the spiked thai tea. Now on to the food.  It was a treat with lots of choices as we ended up sharing dishes to thoroughly enjoy what Pai had to offer. I normally do not like spicy but the level of spiciness was just right.
The dish that I enjoyed the most was the Khao Soi which was noodles with braised beef. The whole night was not rushed and they were so accommodating to serve us the cake that was brought from outside. Definitely will return but will need to book ahead again.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sonny Travis L.,"It was my first time to Pai Northern Thai Kitchen & let me tell you... I LOVE THIS PLACE. I arrived on a Sunny Sunday afternoon with a friend. It was a busy downtown afternoon, parking was difficult to find. Ended up paying $20 for parking at a private lot. It was a wonder Sunday to walk, I didn't mind paying the $20.
Atmosphere: 
As you enter, you'll feel the restaurant's energy. The exposed brick, dim lighting, upbeat rock and roll music & energetic staff is the perfect mixture to create a drinking environment. In addition with great tasting food, I can understand why this place is rated top Thai food places in Toronto
Food & Drinks:
To start we ordered the Chicken Gai Satay. I've eaten at many places for Thai food, from Khao San Road, Thai House Cusine, Golden Thai Restaurant, Spice Thai Cafe, you get the picture. The flavor and moisture of the chicken was phenomenal. It came with a hott sauce and a vinaigrette, absolutely delicious. I highly recommend trying this appetizer.
For our mains, we ate the Khao Soi & Chef Nuit's Pad Thai. The Khao Soi was delicious to the last spoonful. A variety of flavors run through your mouth in every bite. Spices were perfect, noodles were fresh and the soup was mouth watering. Chef Nuit's Pad Thai was an instant classic, watch for your heat request, they can get real spicy real fast, I requested for the spice to be on the side. Again, fresh flavors, tender meat, absolutely delicious.
Price:
Our bill came up to almost $75 before tip. We also drank Singha Beers & has a couple of Sake Bombs! So much fun.
Overall, just writing this review and thinking about their food makes me crave them even more. Take a look at some of the photos I posted, but I suggest go have a bite in your free time to really appreciate the taste. This will be my new go to Thai Food place when the cravings hit. Great job Pai, thank you for a great atmosphere, awesome energy and most of all delicious food!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marco Antonio H.,Green curry in the coconut it awesome! Great spice level and lots of vegetables!! Dont forget to dig into the cocunet and get all of that flesh !!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Foodie M.,"oh this place is really great, being the sister of Khao San road. I would come here before going there and here's why: 
+ much bigger, instead of the 2-3 communal tables at KSR, there's individual tables and even a waiting area so you don't have to line up outside!
+ very nice, cozy decor 
+ menu is just as good if not better (more choices)
+ great, I'd not better service 
+ YOU DONT HAVE TO SIT ELBOW TO ELBOW OR BE STUCK WITH FACING STRANGERS! 
There's probably more ++'s.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Corinne C.,"The soup was warm. And the green curry had weird taste. I switched my dish with my boyfriend and then found out that Pad Thai was still too sweet.
I wouldn't spend time lining up for seats. Though the decor looks attractive and all.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason M.,"Upon arriving at Pai, I was told to expect a wait time of approximately 30 minutes. They had told me to leave my number and would text me when there is an availability. This gave us some time to go for a nice walk around Toronto to burn off some calories! Finally, when my phone lit up, so did my face. I was excited! 
All the options on the menu looked good; however, I decided to be safe and pick the Pad Thai with medium spice. The food was presented on a leaf, which was quite unique. From my first bite, I was blown away and my taste buds went crazy. The Pad Thai was very flavorful and delicious. The sauce had the right balance in richness and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because of the chicken. I found it to be rubbery and flavorless, which was quite disappointing. Overall, I would definitely come back for dinner again!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kay S.,"Phenomenal!
Fun atmoshphere (that may seem crowded to some), great food, cool ambiance. One of my favourite places to go for lunch/dinner.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Usha R.,This is my husband's favorite restaurant. Every chance he gets he wants to have lunch here. It's always busy and gives off a great vibe. Favorite dish is the Pad Gra Prow.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dave S.,"Happening Spot, Cool Vibe, Food is Good
Busy spot when I went.  Cool vibe.  Food is good, but not good enough to be as popular as it is.  Some of the items seemed a bit over-priced for what they are.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,S L.,"Came here for lunch  I had the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with tofu and veggies and had it at their Thai spicy level (max) I was super pleased with this meal because it was both delicious and my kind of spicy (where you're panting/nose is runny). The meal was $15 plus tax which was a little high so when I come next time, it'll be for dinner to help me justify it.
I wasn't able to finish it all since I had dumplings earlier. But I would have devoured it otherwise!
Service was good.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Purti Awal ..,"People throw around the word ""authentic"" so I will follow suit, but in this case, it's good news. It's memories of Thailand all around - flavour of the food, the decor, the drinks generally exceed expectations. 
But you've been warned about two things:
-- There is a noisy, restauranty chatter most dinner nights, which sometimes strains your vocal glands as you find yourself yelling across the table (not first-date appropriate)
--- Wait, wait, and wait some more, and don't come hungry.
The first time I came, I loved the food (Pad Thai and Green Curry), the quirky decor, but gosh, such, loooong wait on a Tuesday night (really?). That put me off and it was a few months till I returned.
The second time I came, we were a group of six and tried the Grabong (a must munch-on while you wait for your mains), Gai Satay, Pad Thai, Khao Soi, Masaman Curry and Green Curry - the food was delicious and the drinks on point. But we waited an hour for a table, and then about 30 mins to get the bill. So that put me off for a few months again.
My most recent venture was a late lunch, which was a welcome change, as there was none of the usual mayhem. 
So that's what Pai has now become - a late lunch or foodora/uber eats order, and now it didn't disappoint!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Donny H.,"Came back again and ordered the same food (khao soi and the green curry in coconut) and also ordered chef nuit pad thai. Khao soi still taste wonderful and the pad thai is definitely the best one I've ever had! The green curry had too strong of a herb taste and it was too overwhelming. 
The Thai iced tea is still my favourite!
The servers are really nice too.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hina M.,"Always enjoy food here. It's my to-go place whenever I have visitors out of town.
Go early - otherwise good dishes get sold out - been trying to order the chicken wings but it's too popular.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina C.,"Sometimes when searching for thai restaurants I'm unsure what I will get. After reading the great reviews of Pai I decided to try my luck for one last meal in Toronto! IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The portions were great, GF accommodating and all spice levels welcome. I would absolutely go back on my next trip to Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matthew P.,"This is an excellent Thai food spot. It's busy and service is fast. Food is great, reasonable priced, and good portions.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Allan M.,"This restaurant is definitely one of the best in Toronto for authentic Thai and Northern Thai food. They have been on Duncan street at a beautiful location for more than 20 years ? Let's just say they were around before a long time before Khao San Road , ( the other best place for authentic Thai food in Toronto but unfortunately limited seating and difficult parking).
 Pai has a new location on Yonge Street north of Eglinton that is beautifully decorated and impressively large but Master Thai Chef Nuit Regular can only be in one location at a time. I am sure that once the Covid crisis is under control, so will the excellence of the food quality at the Duncan street location be duplicated at the new Pai at Yonge & Eg.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Meng Z.,"Yummy yummy Thai food. We came here on a Wednesday night at 4:30 and by 5pm, the restaurant was full and a line formed outside. 
I had the green curry in a coconut, lots of depth and layers of flavours, I was by all means not disappointed at all. We also shared spring rolls and satay, both of which were very yummy. 
Pai reminds me of the flavours I've had in Thailand. Food is the most authentic thai food I've had outside of Thailand (albeit still being a little toned down). While I really enjoyed my meal, I don't see myself lining up for 30+ minutes like other patrons for pai.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah A.,"There will trully never be words to express how phenomenal this restaurant is. The hype is real and justified. There's a little something for everyone despite spice level tolerance. The waiters and waitresses truly care about you, keep coming by asking how everything is, give their recommendations, fill your water glass as often as possible. This is my go-to and take everyone here! Be sure to either eat early or late because their busiest times are the traditional 5-8pm times! (I went at 4:30pm yesterday and it was already packed and when I left around 5pm the line was beginning to form!)
Best restaurant for Thai cuisine!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jess M.,"NEED to find a spot like this back home in the states! The food was excellent and unlike any Thai food I've ever had before. My boyfriend and I split a starter portion of the Tom yum soup, the khao soi (noodles, coriander, green onions, chicken breast, golden curry) and the pad gra prow (basil, ground pork, rice, fried egg, fish sauce). Everything was SO GOOD. My boyfriend had two beers and I got a mixed drink and a glass of red wine. The mixed drink (maybe Summer Dog?) was way too sweet and syrupy, but the wine was decent. 
Only major con of this restaurant is the service. The servers are nice but few and far between. We were waited on by both a guy and girl, and could never track either of them down. Nobody stopped by to see how the food was or if we needed drink refills, and it took a full 30 minutes after finishing our meal to get someone to bring the check over. This place could definitely benefit from having a few more servers on hand.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nagisa A.,"The set up of this place is pretty interesting.  Aside the music being far too loud the night we were there, the food was amazing!  We shared a pitcher of sangria that was quite flavourful.  We also had spring rolls and another appetizer that escapes me.  I ordered the Ox tail in the mild tamarind sauce and goodness it was delicious.  It was a really nice place to go for dinner for a girls' night out.  Will definitely come back again for the food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mabel L.,"Very disappointing!  I came here for the first time last year and the food was amazing.  Since then the quality of the food has gone down.  They even raised their prices probably to deal with the minimum wage increase.  However, now it's an overpriced restaurant with very mediocre food.  They no longer put care into their food and instead mass produce them in bulk to accommodate a large crowd.  I guess it's time to search for a new Thai restaurant because I won't come back.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve S.,"Had a farewell dinner for a good friend who's leaving for Singapore,  she's from Thailand and had highly recommended this place as the most authentic thai restaurant in Toronto. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share, everything in the pictures were pretty good, but most notable were the Kal soy(curry noodles with braised beef) and the Tum Yum soup, both were exceptionally flavourful.  Apparently khal San Road has the same curry noodle dish but is more oily.  
Reservation is highly recommended for this restaurant, they get pretty busy here",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Deb M.,"Pad Gra Prow with ground pork and Pad Thai with chicken were never so good. I'll admit, I'm no expert when it comes to Thai food and I'm beginning to think that maybe it's because I've never had good authentic Thai food before.  We were looking for dinner in the area of the garage where our car was parked and the handy Yelp app was a win when it pulled up this place.  Almost 5 stars and over 2,000 reviews, yes please, I'll go there!  And I'm so glad we did.  It was a little chaotic, with lines and people everywhere.  Tip, even if there are open seats at the bar you still need to get seated by the hostess.  I'm really glad there were open seats at the bar because we had the best experience with the staff. Mike and JJ are awesome and will walk you though the menu.  And will carry on a great conversation about American sports (football).  We started with the shrimp chips and they were not the fast food version that I'm used to.  They were not multicolored and the shrimp taste was much stronger than I've had before.  The dipping sauce was delicious.  We were there the Tuesday after Labor Day when most businesses are dead and there was a line the entire time we were there.  But don't just take my word for it, there are 2,000 other people who agree with me. Go here, enjoy some authentic food in a great atmosphere!  This will be a regular stop for dinner any time I'm in Toronto!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle J.,"Absolutely my worst tasting experience ever. The waitress gave us such bad attitude, like she has any problem with us or what. We sat down for like half an hour to wait for her to order, with no water or dishes. So we KINDLY ask for her to come and she ignored us. When we started to order she has 0 patience and GRABBED the menu out of my hand. I mean even though the food was okay but I have never ever met a server who's attitude this bad, I'm there to have my lunch not to bear her anger. With this service I will definitely not go there again",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,R V.,"Truly wonderful experience here as I ordered one of their more popular dishes - the Chef Nuit Pad Thai for $15 (well worth it as portions are a full-sized plate ~ trust me, it'll feel as though you've eaten a lot however the plate still looks as if you haven't touched a thing lol) The Chef Nuit Pad Thai comes as stir-fried noodles in their home-made tamarind sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, coriander, fresh lime and home-roasted peanuts and your choice of chicken, beef, pork or tofu and veggies - quite a selection.. I went with beef. This dish contains oyster sauce and for a couple bucks more you can add shrimp. My method was satisfying!
The food in itself was absolutely delicious! This is coming from someone who never eats Thai food on a regular basis; nor do I care to order pad thai's when it's on the menu and let me tell you why - some odd years ago I ordered a pad thai for take out and it was dry to the BONE. The dish had peanuts on it which is fine and all, but WOW it just added to the drought even more. Since then, no reason to bother with ordering such a complicated dish because I thought that's how all pad thai's tasted... until Pai. There was flavour, 
Service was incredibly friendly, informative and attentive! Our server was this Asian guy - seemed Filipino to me - however, he was VERY knowledgeable on our dishes, referred me to the special as I was new to DECENT pad thai's after my past regretful stint, and he remembered my seat since I switched to another side of the table (was with a group). At the end of the night when I tipped him he even bothered to ask if I wanted my five cents back, HA! Such honesty! LOL.. 
Anyway, the place is quite loud during peak dinner times, however the atmosphere is genuinely authentic, unique, and interesting. I will definitely recommend and be back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jen E.,"Visiting Toronto for the weekend and looked at Yelp for a good restaurant for dinner after a comedy show at Second City. We were not disappointed. The restaurant is low profile at the entrance. Walking down a few stairs, we were welcomed by friendly staff who sat us immediately. The vibe was fun, relaxed, and hip. The drink menu was amazing and I wished we had more time so I could have tried more. I ordered the coconut and lemongrass infused sake, amazing! My companion ordered the plum mule which was good. There were so many cool and unique drink creations! I ordered a green curry that was served in a coconut, with a side of sticky rice and extra sauce. I opted for the tofu and veggies. It was good, but there was an odd taste that I couldn't put my finger on. My companion ordered an AMAZING beef noodle soup, OMG, so good! I loved how it had a cinnamon taste to it. Yum! The restaurant closed at 10:30pm, but the staff didn't rush anyone out. The staff were very friendly.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Darryl K.,"Very busy and large place. Unique setting with and ingesting menu, which includes a large cocktails menu. This is a fun place. Service was good, food came fast. We shared a large number of dishes at our table. Everything was nice, but nothing stand out for me. Overall a good place to meet fiends, but I don't see myself ordering from here.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dario C.,"Had to try this place after seeing positive reviews on Yelp & some of my Toronto colleagues. Reviews & recommendation were not wrong. I loved Pai for its food, but even more for its decor. We had to wait 30 minutes at the bar for our table but it was worth the wait. We went on a Sunday night & it was jam-packed. I guess you are better off reserving ahead of time-they told me it is always full. Great food, off the wall decor = 5. If you like spicy, try their Pad Thai...but beware that this stuff is crazy spicy !
Hats off to the owners, chefs & decorators !!!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivian D.,"Love the food and atmosphere here! Consistent and tasty. No reservations but if you come for an early dinner, usually no wait or a very short wait. I recommend the pad thai, fried rice, beef salad, garlic shrimp, tom yum soup, and thai tea!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vero W.,"Not sure why this place is so popular. Maybe I put up my hope too high I don't know. We got lucky got a table right before rush hour, I just don't get the huge lineup, yeah the good was okay, but there are sooo many good restaurants in that area. Maybe I should give it second chance.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sandra T.,"Been here a couple of times already and it never disappoints! I've tried the spring rolls, pad thai, khai soi, and penang curry... all were delicious. Basically can't go wrong with anything here!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steven W.,"After trying to go on a Saturday night at 6:30PM, we soon realized how busy this place gets! Lesson learned.. So we returned for an anniversary on a Saturday at 5:30PM and was kindly greeted by the staff to a table without wait. 
The ambiance was very nice and added to the Thai experience! Everything from the dining room to even the restroom (I cannot believe I am commenting on this) decor added to the night. You can tell they put a great level of care into this place. 
The food was superb! One of the best Thai places I have gone to and on the same level as the other place down the street. We started with Sai Ua Platter (Northern Thai Sausage) and to my surprise, it only included one sausage! I was a little concerned, but the flavour was so on point that it was well worth the money. The pad gra prow was very savory and my most recommended item on the menu. The only complaint, which is a little one, was that the Tom Yum soup (which was deliciously sour and hot) ladle is not ideal for scooping soup. If the ladle was a tad smaller, it would have been perfect!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carlo F.,"B+ (disclaimer: I spent 10 yrs in Thailand) 
Great Thai food in downtown Toronto. I've tried most of the things on the menu but my top recos would be the Khao Soi, Pad Gra Prow, and green curry. The curries are well balanced, rich, flavourful and the pad gra prow is savoury with hints of fish sauce and spice. Price to food value is okay ($25 tax incl without alcohol).",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adam G.,"Delish!  Lots of creative options, all super tasty.  It would be nice if the more traditional Thai dishes were available, but I do appreciate the creativity.
Yeah, super busy at times.  Plan ahead and make reservations.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristine L.,"Overly sweet food ruined my tastebud and experience. We dined inside recently and ordered a bunch of things including their curry dishes, soup, salad, wings, khao soi, and more. We ended up having to waste so much uneaten food. The prices are rediculous high comparing to the low quality of the food. Service during Covid is good with the exception of the small tables! Will not return here.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dan L.,"I highly recommend this restaurant.  Like the other reviews, this is an authentic northern Thai restaurant with a cool vibe and a long line-up out the door, so I highly recommend making a reservation.
The other Yelp reviewers are right, the best dishes are Gaeng Masaman Beef and Khao Soi Curry.  I ordered the Masaman Beef and sampled the Khao Soi and they were both very tasty and good portion sizes.
This restaurant is a little cramped and the seating is not super comfortable but the food is delicious.  Enjoy",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris J.,"Nom, nom, nom. Everything we got was delicious. We had a plate of chicken skewers for an appetizer. It came with two different sauces: one pasty and the other like a vinaigrette. Chef Nuit Pad Thai was tasty. I got it mild, but I think I could have gone for medium or even spicier for more flavour. Green curry that was served in a coconut was amazing. 
The restaurant was crazy busy on an early Friday evening yet the service was pretty fast and attentive. This place is small so it may not be best for big groups. The atmosphere is casual and the crowd is young.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Baber A.,"Wonderful experience overall! 
Ambience - the whole restaurant was great. We sat on the high tops. Perhaps not the most comfortable of seating which they can possibly improve on. 
Wait Time - we went on a Saturday without a reservation. It was an hour before closing. The place was still bustling. The wait was less than 20 mins which is more than reasonable. 
Food - we asked for the soup to be spicy and boy did they make sure that we indulged. It was spicy and we loved every sip of it! The entrees we shared and were just so good that we were tempted to order more but the kitchen closed by the time we came out of the coma. 
Will go again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carolyn H.,"We came here for lunch on a Monday and easily got a table. I know some reviewers mentioned you either need patience or a reservation, but that is probably only true for dinner.
The interior is reminiscent of a Thai street. The lighting is a bit dim and the speakers were blaring, and I kept having to remind myself it was monday at noon and not midnight on a Friday night. This might not be the best choice if you want to whisper sweet nothings into your special person's ear.
Luckily the food was good enough that I didn't mind foregoing in depth conversations as I shoveled food into my mouth. We ordered the pad thai and Panang beef. I've had enough mediocre pad Thai in my life that I wasn't expecting much, but this pad thai had the depth and layers of aroma that most lack. The beef was also quite good, but not sure it was better than other restaurant's.
All in all a good experience, but not sure it quite lives up to the 5 star hoopla that surrounds it. That said, there is nothing quite like some Thai spice to warm you up in the dead of winter.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jonathan C.,Pai is my go-to place for Thai food in Toronto. Their green curry is to die for!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maarz A.,"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  
I had lunch there couple years ago. Because the customer service was terrible, that's why I remember it so vividly.  The food was okay not Exceptional just OK. Here's what happened, I ordered the meal and then I wanted to add something to my order, but the server the way she snapped at me as if it is the end of WORLD for her change my order. Later on when we ordered mango juice and wanted to ask her to hold off the ice, but we were so scared to ask her again. My worst experience of Thai food.",1

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. I made a reservation about 2 months ago and it's been a very very long time since I last tried this place. Starting off we have the grabong which are fried buttercup fritters. I saw everybody ordering it so it must've been a popular choice. And for the main we have the chicken chef nuit pad thai. Let's dive right into the review.
Wow does the appetizer look big; piled up as high as it can go. The crispiness of it lathered with sweet garlic tamarind dip really enhanced the flavour. I was however most excited for their main dish. Don't underestimate the size, once I mixed the pad thai it filled the entire plate. I really enjoyed the texture of the noodles and the flavour was just perfect, in comparison to many pad thai places where the pad thai is pretty bland. I felt like I could taste the texture of each individual noodle in my mouth. My girlfriend mentioned that this place serves pad thai as authentic you can get compared to what they served in Thailand. Now that's pretty impressive! My girlfriend wanted to take the pictures this time because she says I take unflattering photos. I just wanted to mention to not pay attention to the smudge on the bottom left of the pad thai picture. That is definitely not her finger :P
Being as busy as they were, the staff were very friendly and we enjoyed a nice conversation with them. Being an asian restaurant I wanted to see if they would refill my water when I finished drinking it. To my surprise, they did without me asking!
The whole meal came out to approx $60 for two pad thais and the grabong. Generally, I would say this is on the pricier side of Toronto pad thai places, but comparing the portion size and the quality of the food it was pretty worth it in my opinion.
All in all, I think this is one of the best pad thai places in Toronto and I will make another reservation again. I wouldn't come on the weekends though as even on a Tuesday the wait would still be over 30 minutes unless you don't mind waiting. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda C.,Unreal & delicious! Best curry:D amazing food and can't wait to be back. chef Is the best I've ever encountered in Toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Catherine H.,"We wanted Thai when we arrived in Toronto and we knew we should be able to find something good, because TO has so many family run restaurants with authentic home cooking. We found Pai Northern on Yelp and it was a 6 minute walk from  our hotel (even after a day of an now yesterday). We went for dinner last night expecting to just walk in  because with all snow we thought people would stay home. We arrived to a 45 minute wait. Not thrilled, but we had time and figured if this many people are willing to come out in a snow storm it must be good and it smelled amazing. We gave our phone number and grabbed a drink next door while waiting.  We were called back within 30 minutes, still took a few more minutes to get to our table when we got back.  The place has more space than you would think and it's a fun kitchi decor. We ordered Shrimp Chips, spring rolls and some items we couldnt pronounce. I had the third curry from the top in the curry selection on the menu. I'm sure the shrimp chips were very authentic, but I found them a little heavy compared to the cheap almost styrofoam chips you get in other places, but very tasty and came with a nice dip with garlic and a little something sweet. The spring rolls were perfect, very balanced and a nice light heat to the dipping sauce. My curry, with chicken, was the best curry I have ever had, from the curry flavor to the creamy texture and not one rubbery piece of chicken - all perfectly cooked tender pieces of white meat. Even my  son who  doesn't usually like curry said he would eat it again. I would highly recommend this place, great food, fun atmosphere and fast service! Perfect for just before or after a show or game!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,F K.,"Covid times. Items were overpriced and I can't say I will come back for the food. Then menu is found via QR code and through your phone, and the issue we had was that certain items would be Grayed out and labeled sold out, but after seeing other people order the items, we asked our server about it and she said it was available.  I had the pad Thai with beef and I found it to be too tangy. Every Thai restaurant makes their pad Thai differently. Also had the $40 appetizer tray--fried squash was good and the pork skewers, the rest you can pass on. Egg rolls were good. I also had a lychee cocktail, pricey/small but worth a shot.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel Y.,"Get ready to wait in line. Why is this place so damn busy every time! Must have some exceptional dishes, but I've yet to try them.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennefer K.,"we ordered takeout from Pai Northern Thai and we found it average if anything. The food was overly sweet, and the dishes did not offer anything to brag about to say the least. I dont think I would eat here again, maybe it's personal preference but i wasnt a huge fan. But I'll still give them 3 stars, because I have had worse...lol
jennefer",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katie B.,Yummy and arrived quickly. Vegan options available and accommodated my special requests.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lilian L.,"Not your run of the mill Thai restaurant. Interesting decor with upbeat music playing in the background. Not a fan of dimly lit restaurants. I know it's supposed to set the mood but it only makes me sleepy lol. I sat at one of the tables with bar stools and it wasn't very comfortable. There are hooks on the side of the table to hook your bags and jackets to but I think it would have been better to have hooks on the walls for jackets. Weren't a lot of hooks and if you were wearing a long coat, it'll drag on the ground. 
My friends got the Khao pla tawt (fish) and Khao soi, and I got the ox tail. No complaints about the fish and the only thing my friend had to say about the khao soi was that it was a little too creamy for her but if that's your thing then give it a try. 
I enjoyed my ox tail dish very much! The sauce was amazing and there was more meat than I expected. Meat was fall off the bone so very very tender. Haven't tried anything else there but definitely planning to!
It's a nice touch that they added the Wi-Fi password and network on the menu but unfortunately, it didn't work when I was there (Dec 15).",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hannah D.,Excellent food and atmosphere! The food is extremely tasty and unique! Always stop here when in toronto!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carlos G.,"Very lively ambiance and friendly staff.  The food was just okay.  I'm used to a side of condiments but they were very cheap.  One lime wedge, very little hot oil.  Left the dish bland even after I used all condiments.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jim A.,"We came to Toronto for the night and saw Pai on Yelp. With so many good reviews we had to come and try it out ourselves. We were not disappointed. It was Friday night so the wait was about an hour, which is not unreasonable. The host was super friendly. We went to the bar next door while we waited. They also have a little lounge room with drinks and snacks while you wait if you choose to wait inside. Once we were seated we got drinks immediately. We got a pitcher of sangria which was amazing. We ordered a ton of appetizers and entrees, all which were delicious. Our server, Ivy was very attentive and friendly. I wish there was a Pai in New York! Would defiantly recommend this place to anyone who loves Thai food or wants to try something new.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sophie P.,"Ohhh man, I am obsessed with Thai food. And Pai has been the best so far. It's so great I keep telling my partner that we are having take out Thai for both the wedding rehearsal dinner and after the ceremony, not kidding.
The larb was super delicious and so were their spring rolls and the yellow curry and the pad Thai. They also had that iced tea which you want to order at least 3 times. 
To finish off, order the mango sticky rice and you will not regret any over-eating.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Travelling C.,"Hands down my fave Thai restaurant bc they serve up the best papaya salad I've had in the GTA.
I judge every place by their papaya salad and am still so impressed with it.
Have to say that I love the vibe and it has fabulous food for great prices!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tony B.,"I was in Toronto for the Real Estate Forum and decided to indulge in my Thai food cravings so I checked out PAI.
The first thing I noticed were the incredibly friendly staff. From the moment I walked in, to the moment I ordered my first drink. Try their caesar, you won't be disappointed!
It was a Tuesday night and it was busy. I had to wait about 10 minutes for my table. I had the papaya salad, Pad Thai and the green curry. All of these dishes came out one after the other and were all delicious! 
This will be my go-to Thai fix! 5 stars!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hayley S.,"This place is f***ing cool! 
haha! I love the food so much. Got the pad thai with my mom on our way to see a Mirvish show! 
Next time I will remember to come super in advance, as the wait is pretty long, even though the placed is huge, it is packed with people everywhere. It is nice that you can order drinks at the bar while waiting though!
I am also in awe of whoever designed this restaurant. Every nook and corner is beautiful!
Bravo!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roham D.,"We got the set menu, and it was great. All was fine and dandy until we got the bill, got charged around $700 for a table of 8!
Great food but Watch the bill!",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,R S.,"Delicious food. Best Thai food I've found in Toronto. Highly recommend the pad Thai, spring rolls and chicken dishes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ms. L.,"Excellent food, good service, fun atmosphere and the best Thai iced tea I've ever had. I got there 6:45 on a Friday night, my dinner companion arrived at 7, and we were seated at 7:05 because this place is huge! We were seated in the back-back-back room which was full and decorated with rock, funk and jazz paraphernalia. 
I couldn't understand the musical choice: beautiful soul, funk and blues songs chopped in half and replaced with the next soul, funk or blues song. Was it a live DJ? Or someone who thinks of these songs as background created a song track thinking who cares that you only get half to two-thirds of each song? Mistake.
Other than that, a great place. Will return.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina R.,"Killer spot loacted downstairs off Pearl. Intimate vibe with friendly staff and killer food. We got the squash fritters, pad thai with tofu and green curry with beef along with a pitcher of sangria. EVERYTHING was so good. The music was a bomb mix of reggae and current hits. The staff and my fellow eaters were a beautiful melange of young downtowners. This place hit on all counts. It was my first visit but won't be my last.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chong T.,"This review is long overdue. I have taken many of my friends here for their 1st time and/or recommended this place and they absolutely love it (I'll be coming here again very soon...now for the review)
Rating: 4.5/5
I ended up coming here for my birthday (woo for getting older/wiser/closer to retirement?) during lunch with a few friends. Let me warn you now, GET THERE EARLY. In my experience (been there over 5 times) for dinner, get there before 6:00pm if you are walking in and for lunch, before 12:00pm.
Ordered:
1) Garlic Shrimp - 6 deep fried breaded black tiger garlic shrimp served with a sweet and spicy Thai chilli sauce.
- this was delicious, couldn't started off with a better appetizer 
- if you have a large group of say, 4 people, I highly recommend getting the Grabong for dinner, which is freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters
2) Chef Nuit Pad Thai w/chicken
- in my opinion, this is the best Pad Thai I have ever had in Toronto (I had great Pad Thai in Thailand before). Decent-sized portion with lots of flavour, by far, my absolute favourite in the city! 
- another favourite of mine is the Gaeng Masaman with braised beef - tender beef - you will absolutely love itttt!!!
Review:
I can't say enough about this place because I never leave disappointed (I have high expectations and I'm hard to please when it comes to food). If you are looking for some good Pad Thai and/or a place that won't hurt your wallet, come here! Reasonable prices, great food/service!
Helpful tips:
- No Reservations: if walking in, come before 12:00pm for lunch, 6:00pm for dinner (this place is pretty popular and I have seen long lines for dinner during the peak hours from 6:30-8:00pm 
- Recommendations: Order Pad Thai, Masaman with braised beef, Garlic Shrimp, Squash Fritters, they even have REALLY GOOD SANGRIA!
- Seating: lots of tables for 2's/4's. May be a bit tight in the middle since all the tables are close together where it is easy to overhear a conversation from your neighbours. They just opened up some additional space in the back, so they can take more people in. If you have a large party of say 16, they do have a private room hidden behind the bar.
- Environment: good place for a reunion, date, place is hipster",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victor W.,"We found Pai while wandering around Toronto and looking for well-reviewed places to eat. The restaurant did not disappoint. Walking down the stairs from street level, the place was packed with people but we were seated immediately. It's a very relaxed atmosphere with friendly staff, cool decor, and clean restrooms.
The food is insanely good. We started with the Thai Chicken Wings which were crispy and delicious. For entrees, we had the Chef Nuit Pad Thai and the Khao Soi and both were to die for. The food arrived fast, tasted great, and left me wanting to return to try some of the other things on the menu.
If you're in Toronto and want some great Thai, get to Pai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cecilia T.,First time at Pai and I thought it was better than average. Not as good as Sukhothai but the regional flavours are different as Pai focuses on northern specialities. I had some curry egg noodle and the braised beef was DELICIOUS. Would come back and try other dishes.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lynn C.,"I'm torn between giving this place a three or a four star, but i think I'm going to go with four. The food here is good. Like, really good. Apparently the previous chef from Khao San Road is here cookin' up a storm with even more authentic Thai selections. The place is also decorated with detail as well, feeling like you've walked onto an Asian island - even the bathroom doors are made with panels of wood and wooden bolts. There are seatings with beautiful pillows on the floor, where you have to take off your shoes. 
But the place is busy. We went at around 7 to put our name down and waited next door at the bar to be called at around 8. We were seated at one of those floor tables and proceeded to order rather quickly - five dishes for five people: thai green curry that comes in a coconut, pad gra prow with beef (my favourite), pad thai, kha soi, and a thai fried rice with chicken...and at 9 pm, almost an hour after we ordered our food, they arrived. 
I would really like to eat back here again, but my friends who have experienced the exact same timing issue the last time they were there probably would not be too keen on this...so now to con someone else to come with me...",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Peter L.,"Hands down, this is my favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto. Tom Yum soup is quite generous and can be a meal by itself. However, my favorite dish would have to be the pad gra pow.
I think everybody should try this",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Josephine L.,"This place is IT!!! The BEST Thai food I've had outside of Thailand. I'm from NYC which is filled with so many Thai restaurants but sadly I have to come all the way to TO for the best. For appetizers: the grabong- so crispy and savory but a little sweet, the Miang Kung if you want something interesting and very authentic. For entrees: I always have such a hard time deciding between pad gra prow (minced pork) and Khao soi- they are both ridiculously good. I always have been meaning to try the fried fish because it was something I ate so much while in south east asia but I can never not choose Pad Gra Prow or Khao Soi. The pad thai is also amazing. Anything you choose, you really can't go wrong at this restaurant. It's always crowded but 100% worth the wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Deborah B.,Amazing food and good drinks too! The place is loud and the service is slow but nothing beats the taste.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gordon K.,"I thought I posted a review, but apparently not! This is definitely a great place for lunch as well as a date / friends night out. Prices are a bit pricey, but the quality and quantity of food is decent. They are almost always packed during the busy times, so either go a bit earlier or a bit later for lunch. I wouldn't really recommend Pai for more than a party of 4 people as the tables aren't really suited for larger party sizes. For lunch, you can head over to the Pai market (head towards the washroom area) and you can have their dish of the day.
I have not had a bad dish here, but I would definitely recommend the Gaeng Massaman or the Kao Soi. But their pad thai is pretty good alongside of the Gang Kiaw Wan (it's curry...served in a coconut, which is a pretty popular dish).
Service: 4/5
Food: 5/5 (was...cooked enough, i think?)
Price: 4/5
Overall: 4.5 / 5 (Their dishes are always consistent and the kitchen is super efficient.)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Enid C.,"After watching a TIFF movie at the Scotiabank theatre, my friends and I walked to this restaurant, seeing how it has really good reviews. We were welcomed by a really friendly (and cute!) server and seated immediately. The environment, as said by my friends, is very much like Thailand. Lighting is very dim, but sets the a nice mood for being loud and social. Our waiter was very friendly and talkative which contributed to part of our positive experience.
I ordered the green curry in a coconut ($16), mainly because I wanted to eat out of a coconut haha! I asked for mild and it was the perfect amount of spicyness - not too overwhelming but still has that nice kick. I could not finish the whole dish because it was just so filling. The coconut could not fit all of the curry so they put it into another bowl which I barely touched because eating everything out of the coconut already made me full. The presentation of the dish was very appetizing to look at and I had an enjoyable time eating my dish. The prices are average which is why I only gave it 4 stars but the food was AMAZING.
I will definitely come back to try the pad thai whenever I'm in downtown!
TL;DR amazing food, fun environment, average price but would definitely come back",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Harini S.,I had Pad Thai vegetarian and it was sooo good. My husband and I came here for lunch after reading all the Yelp reviews. The service was great! The ambience was very hippie. I liked how they served my dish on plantain leafs over a plate which gave a very authentic feel. I also had a Pai Sangria which was very fresh and colorful. They told us they could make most of their menu items vegan which actually gave us several choices.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tim H.,"Great Thai food and friendly service. Great flavor and freshness in the morning glory vegetable side dish.  The tofu pad thai had tons of fresh veggies in it.  Also had a Northern Thai ground chicken dish that was good.  
I liked that their Thai iced tea wasn't overly sweet. 
Would definitely come back here.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samtha K.,"To start off with, the ambience of the restaurant was lovely on a Friday afternoon. We had to wait for 20 minutes for a table which was OK since we read great reviews about this place. Most dishes had the option to make it vegan.
Dishes ordered: Papaya Salad, Panag Curry, Green Curry and Fried Rice",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin B.,"Did not live up to the hype from Social media and BlogTO. The food on their website and on Instagram looks very appealing and eye catching, but in reality I found their food to be quite disappointing. Portions are very small in comparison to the price you pay for each item. Three BBQ pork Skewers (Moo Ping) costs $12, something you can eat in 2 min as a light snack. Three veggie Spring Rolls costs $10, again something that should be at least half the price. Their signature Khao Soi is similar to an average Indian style coconut milk curry with a small side of noodles (Barely any crispy noodle garnish). To top it off their famous Thai Iced Tea comes in a little bottle that you have to pour in a glass and add your own ice in order to drink. We couldn't enjoy this drink properly since we were walking on the street, we were expecting a ready made drink in a cup that you drink from already made.
Because of COVID and lockdown restrictions in Toronto we are not allowed in, even for Takeout pickup you must wait on the sidewalk and pay outside. They do not split bills on takeout orders for some reason.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tono M.,"Went to this restaurant without reading any reviews and what a great choice. We were seated right away by a very pleasant host. 
The server was great, pleasant,  efficient, and personable. 
We had a curry and soup  (can't remember the name but it had lemon grass). Both were absolutely delicious.
If you're n the area, try this place out.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Farrah N.,"Absolutely the best thai food I've had in Toronto. 
Was craving some authentic thai during a 2 month stay in the beautiful Toronto during winter. This place does it. It's in a super cool spot (although parking is a pain), with a playful menu, but the flavors are 10/10. 
Love the curry noodles and beef stew and pad thai. The shredded pork with rice and egg are a must! Order everything if your wallet allows, portions are not that big. Cocktails are strong and tasty. 
We went late afternoon and there was no wait. Service was a little slow and prices are a little high though but I will be back for more each visit!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Theresa F.,"After dropping off our things at our Airbnb and a quick Yelp search, we were on our way to Pai Northern Thai Kitchen. 
We ordered two Thai iced teas, shrimp Pad Thai, and shrimp Pad Gra Prow.  The Thai iced tea was perfectly sweet (as it should be), and the shrimp Pad Thai was probably the best Pad Thai dish I have ever had. Ever. I didn't try Howard's Pad Gra Prow, but he killed it and then he killed the rest of my Pad Thai.
The Yelp reviews are truth. Come here. Wait for a bit if you have to. It is so worth it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Isabelle W.,"A must try! One of my favorite places to go for Thai food. Definitely for a heavier pallet but so flavorful and not overwhelming /competing tastes. Everything is delicately balanced be it the textures, visual presentation, and tastes are layered. Absolutely delicious when your first taste is delightful and follows with a 2nd taste in that same bite. That's when you know there's true art to the amazing food pieces they serve. 
Environment and ambiance is very warm, always packed, and relaxed vibe. When I have food friends in town, it's always a top of mind place to go and never fails to deliver and awe my guests though that are worldly travelers!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel F.,"Environment was wonderfully decorated. Fast-paced 70's music in the background to rush the customers--long wait time at dinner. On to the food:
Curry was good! Encapsulated in a caccoon of flavor. The coconut bowl complimented it well. I prefer my curry with potatoes but I didn't mind. Thai tea standard. Service was good (shout out to the pregnant lady. You were beast mode and hope you had a wonderful baby by the time of this posting!) 
Word of warning! The doorway doesn't provide clear WATCH YOUR STEP sign and I slipped (shout out to the man I accidentally nudged on my descent)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jack N.,Best restaurant in Toronto! The food and atmosphere was second to none. Their level of their spicy is insane and you will have a fun time if you love spicy food!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mo G.,"My people!! The waitress was so nice and the food was extremely authentic and delicious!! Would def go back!! Sticky rice and mango was legit! Differentiating ""Farang spicy"" and ""Thai spicy""  was def clever and hilarious to me. Their cocktails were amazing as well! Love the place very much!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bruce G.,"This is probably the best Thai food in Toronto. I've never been to Khao San road before they closed, but this one hits the spot.  The decor inside is like a thai backpacking place - very original.  It is in the basement, but very spacious - which unfortunately does not mean that there's always space - more often than not it is completely full and you have to wait.  Bad for people who never wait for any restaurant (like me), so just move on.
Otherwise, the food is amazing.  My Pad Thai with chicken was just right, exact combination of sauce, noodles and meat.  My girflriends veggie dish was also very well cooked and had amazing flavor - a rarity for vegetarian dishes.  They have a good selection of beer and the service is pretty good.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tom B.,Second time I've been here and it's always great. If you can call ahead that's best since there's always a line!,5

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sha Y.,"Ever since I came back from Thailand, I've been looking for a good Khao Soi soup but unfortunately everything paled in comparison to what I had over there...But I'm so happy to say that the one at Pai Thailand comes pretty darn close!! Unfortunately...or fortunately..I don't live in Toronto, or else I would be there quite often. It is a pretty rich soup but so worth it! Def add the marinated veggies, it takes the soup to a whole other level. I wish they gave more though. Next time I'm in town, I will def try the green curry dish as well!",4

Will definitely return!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin N.,"The food is really good. I went during lunch time, I ordered shrimp fried rice. But I ended up getting chicken fried rice. I sent it back and I had to wait until I got the right order. I recommend this place!",4

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Justin M.,"Everything on the menu is blessed. My go-to is the pad Thai but I've tried many appetizers and am always pleasantly surprised at how delicious they are. 
Love the environment and ambience as well. The only downside is that on evenings its extremely difficult to find seating, as expected! Overall highly recommend for anyone that enjoys Thai food in Toronto",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ori M.,"Thank god we finally were able to get a table. This place is busy from morning till night (good for them). I really had a great time eating at Pai. They know how to make authentic Thai food and the make it feel as if you're back in Thailand. One thing I would recommend is make sure you book a table in advance (at least 2 weeks). Also, try the Pad Thai (I know baassicc) but it was delish!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessie H.,"My favorite spot for quick lunch and dinner, it was right next to my office. One of the best pad Thai in town. Love the food and the atmosphere! If your office is near pai or you love ordering out for lunch, don't miss out on their lunch market place. Great bang for your buck, offers a different special every day. Check out my last picture, I forgot what it was called, it was rolled up rice noodles in a stewed pork belly sauce, a very interesting and good tasting dish to try.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ann A.,"Excellent place for Thai food. We had the spring rolls to start, followed by the chicken pad thai, chicken, Khao Pad Thamada, and pad gra prow. Everyone loved the spring rolls, they were hot and fresh.  My favourite was the chicken pad Thai. It's exactly what you expect a good pad Thai to be- heavy on flavour, hearty but not too greasy. I had the mild version but then added quite a bit of their chilli sauce. The Khao Pad Thamada which is more of a fried rice had surprisingly good flavor but left a little to be desired. I would more likely order the noodles again. The vibe was casual and relaxed, and their prices were very reasonable. Will definitely be coming back when I'm in the area!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brian C.,"Overall I really like this place. I LOVE Thai food and I'm very picky when it comes to flavor and spice.
Got 2 orders of the Thai wings to start. And a sangria to drink (delicious)
I ordered the pad Thai with shrimp and a side of crispy pork on the side. There's 5 level of spicy I got the 4th one. I wasn't sure how spicy I wanted it, even though I love spicy I want to be able to enjoy it.
The good was spicy BUT it wasn't too spicy. The server was nice enough to bring me a side of their super spicy chili oil, which then made it super super spicy. which I didn't mind because at least I didn't get it all over my food. I like to control my spicyness if I have an option lol. 
We waited about 40/50mins for a table, which wasn't too bad. I was set to eating here so we waited. Make sure to check in with the host every 20/30 min cuz even though they said they'll text you when your table is ready sometimes they forget.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily C.,"My first experience here was on a Wednesday afternoon right before the Kinky Boots show in Alexandra theatre. The experience was so great that I instantly knew I'd found a good go-to Thai restaurant. 
The interior is bustling with life, with a Jamaican-Thai feel. They even have hooks on the posts beside the tables where you can hang your bag, jacket, or umbrella. It's pretty great!
The service here was exceptional. All the servers here were super down to earth and catered to my needs before I even realized my needs myself. Like one of the servers came and asked us if we needed chopsticks. I didn't know if they had chopsticks and the thought didn't even cross my mind so I'm happy he brought it up.
The beef noodle soup was SOOOO good and so flavourful. I'm probably not well-versed enough in the world of Thai food to be a dependable critic, but the soup tasted more than just salt and broth. It was delicious, and the beef was very tender. Also the portions were great for the price. I split the noodle soup and pad thai with my cousin and we hardly put a dent in the pad thai because we tried to finish all the delicious soup while it was still fresh.
Definitely will recommend to all my friends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Robinn C.,"Pai has a wonderful atmosphere when you enter the restaurant. Much like entering a secret bar that also serves delicious foods. The food is very much like eating in the streets of Thailand, with fresh ingredients and comfortable ambience. When I went, it was very crowded but we were able to sit down in about 15 to 20 minutes. 
I would definitely come back again! Overall, Pai is a great place to go to, and it definitely will make you feel like you travelled to Thailand to eat the food. :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rose W.,Great food at this restaurant - one of our favourite Thai places in downtown Toronto! I really like their Pad Thai!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mandy M.,"I had the Pad Cha Het while my boyfriend had the green curry. We also shared the vegetarian fried spring rolls. Note - we ordered take out so the green curry wasn't served in a coconut. 
The food overall was pretty good however, we were really disappointed about the portions. Not sure if it's the same dining in but we decided to add shrimp for an additional $3 and only got 1 SHRIMP. Considering that the meal came to be $21, the portions definitely don't round up near to that. Just a little heads up if you're deciding to do delivery. We'll definitely dine in next time.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tyler D.,This time I had the pad gra prow (with beef) and I think it has taken over the green curry as my new favourite dish! Also had the squash fritters which were really good!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paul G.,"Not bad.   I have had better.  I did like the ample supply of wasabi. :).  
I would think that people will like the selection",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kurt P.,"Great atmosphere, awesome cocktails, SUPER fast service and delicious food. Win!
Really enjoyed all the food and drinks we ordered!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katie C.,"Yummm. This ended up being a perfect weeknight spot to have dinner with coworkers on a business trip. There was a nice lively atmosphere, good drink selection, and the food was delicious! It was a little busy so would recommend making a reservation, but we got lucky and got a table within just a few minutes. There were a decent number of gluten free options, and I ended up going with the Pad Thai. It was SO good. The sauce was really next level. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal. Would love to come back and try more dishes!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Isaac E.,"This is one of those gems that I like to keep in my back pocket that I keep on talking about.
They've got a solid Pad Thai and their spring rolls were well worth it. I can't wait to use them for a corporate event. Service was great and efficient. if you can get a seat on the patio, I'd say DO IT! It's a little cramped but a great place to hang out.
Well priced too. Can't wait to go back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Miro C.,"Excellent Thai food which felt authentic even when I visited shortly after coming back from Thailand. Make a reservation, it's always busy!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kierstin R.,"If you're in Toronto definitely a place to checkout! Came here with some of my coworkers by a recommendation and it did not disappoint. There was so much delicious food, that I hardly knew what to get. We ordered for the table of 8 of us a bunch of different appetizers to start off. We got 2 of each because there wasn't enough for 8 people if we just got one of each. I ended up ordering the Pad Thai as my entree and it was really good! I can't handle a lot of spice so I got the medium and it didn't really have that much of a kick to it. Sooooo if you want to be tearing up or have a bit more spice I would highly suggest getting the spicier levels. I would recommend making a reservation the day before or if you don't mind waiting for a bit the line is long because everyone is finding out about this hidden gem. I can't wait til I can go back and try the curry because I heard that was definitely a favorite of my coworkers. See you soon Toronto!;)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Venessa R.,"Tried them out today and was completely unsatisfied. Tried it coz of the rave reviews about the food and atmosphere but Food is very meh. Ordered the Tom Yum soup and asked the server if its possible to make it less spicy, he said it's not that spicy but when the food came, I barely ate it. My boyfriend tried the Khao Soi as it is very popular and but he was disappointed with the taste too.
The place is very artsy and pleasant but tables are way too close to each other. Its kinda like a foodcourt setup but with servers. 
I like the fact that despite not having reservations, we didn't have to wait for a very long time to be seated as we came early before dinner rush.
To be really honest, this place is overhyped and I probably wont go back again.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ria E.,"Everything, everything we order was awesome!! The food was amazing, the staff very attentive, the drinks were great and strong (just how I like it)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark Z.,"Definitely ethnic,
Definitely full of flavor,
And definitely something a Canadian has to check out when it comes to exploring modern Thai Food done well and interesting!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wincy S.,"The wait for a Wednesday night was long but understandable given the small space of the restaurant. The place is crowded meaning patrons waiting their table will be (im)patiently watching you eat from the sidelines, so eat quickly and don't hang out after your meal! Overall I had no complaints but nothing stood out as exceptional to me. 
The menu is simple--about a dozen traditional main entrées, about a dozen appetizers, and dessert of the day. The Northern Thai sausage platter appetizer was an unexpected item - it reminded me of steamed Chinese preserved sausages but with more grit and lemongrass. The bean paste sauce that came with it was tasty but didn't tip me over the scale of wanting to order the app again. The green curry served in a coconut was fragrant and satisfying, the option to select spice level suits every palate. The accompanying bowl of jasmine rice was a good size to go with the curry, but on the dry side. 
A decent selection of beers and other drinks are available, which suits the casual and ""ethnic"" atmosphere well. The Thai iced tea is a crowd favourite and many patrons ordered one as they waited for their table - it's on the sweet side but complements perfectly with the spicy menu.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt W.,"Once in a while you eat at a place while visiting a city that makes you momentarily contemplate moving there just so you could eat that food.  This was the case on my visit to Toronto, and the restaurant was Pai.  I got the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup,l and the wing appetizer, but it was a tough call picking something out because so much of the menu looked great and authentic.  The beef noodle soup was packed with flavor complexity - a hallmark of northern Thai cuisine.  Getting this on a chilly night hit the spot.  5/5 for sure",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marina R.,"I was on the phone trying to order with Khao San Road for over 30 mins calling back over and over again. No one picked up. Called here they picked up on the third ring took my order and had it ready in 15mins with a smile on their faces. 
^ that is service worth  great job! 
Will defiantly be coming here more often.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kay C.,"Terrific food, impeccable service.
Was able to walk in on a weeknight (2 of us) and sit at the bar, which I'm sure is rare seeing how the crowds rolled in after us. 
The wait staff looked happy to be there and were helpful in selecting a dish. 
We ordered the squash fries and the beef Kao Soi noodles which was sooooo delectable . (If we were hungry enough we would have ordered a side of rice and poured the rest of the  sweet coconut curry broth over it). Instead we soaked our fries in it. I can't handle much spice, so this dish was just perfect. 
Portions were generous, taste was wonderful, and service was great. Nothing not to like (although you should make a reservation).",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Charlene R.,Every time I'm in town I make sure to come here. The food is delicious. I had the basil chicken dish and it was phenomenal. The sangria was watered down and tasted like juice. The service is a bit slower and they are usually packed so there is a bit of a wait. But it was delicious,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vera C.,"I have been to Pai many times and it gets crazy busy.  There food is amazing as always.  Today my friend and I went to Pai without reservation and it was just the 2 of us, we were told to line up in this line which start from bottom of the stair and to the top then back down to the front reservation booth.  It was extremely crowded at the entrance/stairs to be honest as I see this as a safety hazard.  Basically there was one lane way to go up/down the stairs as people were lining up to get a table. Despite they told us, it would be a 20 min wait for the line to get to the reservation booth but they don't know how long would it be to get a table. I remember they used to give out the buzzer and you allowed to put your name down.  I asked them if we can sit at the bar, then they said its part of wait.  What a shit show!",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adrienne W.,"Pai is amazing.  Based on the reviews you'e seeing, you know it's an extremely busy place.  Going to Pai on a Friday night at 7 pm is probably your dumbest decision ever but it's well worth the wait.  (Try going at 5:30 ish to beat the rush). Here are a few things that we've gotten in the past: 
DRINKS: 
a) Thai iced tea - YES YES YES!!! GET IT.  It is this ridiculously sweet caffeinated, ridiculously yummy tea.  The first time the bf wanted to share it..yeah he didn't get any. 
APPETIZERS: 
a) Grabong - omg YES. YES. YES. Get it.  It is delicious and the one menu item that is actually great for sharing even though you'll not want to share it! 
b) Miang Kung - it was great and flavourful but really it was a very small appetizer.  I didn't think it was worth the $15 we paid for it.  It was barely shareable and just the fact that it was so overpriced just turned me off. 
MAINS: 
a) Pad Thai - this is my ultimate favourite dish of all at Pai.  I could eat this until I died and then eat it after I died and eat it after I reincarnate.  Main point being...yes, it's delicious.  Definitely get it.  It's one of the best pad thai's I've EVER had. 
b) Gaeng Masaman w/ beef - This was good and flavourful but it wasn't mind blowing.  The beef was yummy and the sauce was good.  It's worth a try b/c it's a very traditional Thai dish. 
c) Pad Gra Prow - This was also a delicious item that I would get again.  We had it with pork and it was a good amount of spice and flavour.  It's also another item on the menu that is a must get. 
d) Khao Soi - unfortunately, I was not impressed with this dish.  Maybe it was an off day but the noodles didn't taste good at all and the chicken drumstick was very flavourless.  I would not get this menu from the item and this and the Gaeng Masaman are the reasons why this place is not receiving 5 stars.  
DESSERTS: 
I wish I were not dying of fullness by the end of each meal so that I could order dessert.  Alas, I have nothing for you.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joanne T.,"Amazing food here, I feel in love with the Khao Soi when I ordered it for the first time. I've also tried the rom yin soup which was as sour as I like it. The servers was all kind. Would say it is a great place to hang to either have a drink or share a meal with.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,KyungJung H.,"I visited this restaurant twice during my visit because I had a good memory on my first visit for lunch. Although Panang curry is nothing special with few vegetables, fried rice and thai tea were great with really cool atmosphere. 
However, I was super disappointed and felt sorry for my friend who I brought for dinner. A server was really unfriendly, and it seemed like forgetting our food already ready to be served. Pad Thai, which came after over 40 min, was overcooked and cooled down so it was like a rice cake. When I flipped the food, it was not like a noodle. However, the server did not feel even sorry and asked what is wrong with the food. Additionally, the same fried rice that I had for lunch was also terrible because it was already cooled down with overcooked and hard to chew porks. 
Mistakes could be happened in busy weekend dinner hours, but I was dissapointed about the server's attitude and different quality of foods they served.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sana M.,"Personally i was excited to try this place out as I love Thai food. I was highly disappointed. First of all the wait here I crazy, and after eating I don't feel it was worth it. 
The green curry in the coconut might have looked good but it was very watery and slightly cold. The food overall could have had a lot more flavor. This is a great place if you are not to pushed about food and want somewhere with a great ambiance but if you want good Thai food there are many locations in Toronto I would go to before Pai. 
I do have to admit that the staff and service was very good, it's just the food that was underwhelming.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily J.,"Delicious! Braised beef egg noodles and sausages were both amazing. Spring rolls are also great to start if you're hungry. Cute decor, usually packed with a long waitlist, seats are close together. Come in, enjoy food, and find a nice cafe nearby to chill after.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexis L.,"One of my favourite spots in the city!
In fact, if I could, I'd give Pai a 10 star rating! I've enjoyed many meals at this delicious restaurant, my favourite being the green curry. I have NEVER been let down. 
This place is definitely a spot you want to go a little before you're hungry, though - there is always a wait! But deservingly so! Once you get your name put down on the wait list, they allow you to grab a drink at the bar. I always dive into the culture in which I'm about to eat, and man their Thai beer is good! It's called Singha, which is an easy drinking lager. 
Service has always been amazing here. And the decor is AMAZING! It's tucked away underground and is deceivingly large! Seriously, the restaurant just keeps going! The music is always great and actually has great sound (the perfect amount of bass... not that treble-y crap you hear at some restaurants). This is a place you can come with any kind of company and have fun!
And ps - they participate in UberEATS, guys!
(This place is my guilty pleasure when I'm hungover and on the couch, ha).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Natalie G.,"Damn this is becoming one of my FAV Thai restaurants in the city!
I love the atmosphere filled with all sorts of good vibe quotes and pictures of Bob Marley, vacation photos, and all sorts of other decor that creates a chilled out yet happening spot. It is best to make reservations here as it seems to be quite busy any day of the week.
The service can be hit or miss, but it's usually been a great experience for me.  
I've tried the pad thai, the beef khao soi, green curry and fried chicken wings and all really lived up to the hype.  The khao soi was especially delicious with the perfect flavouring and tender beef.
This is a must go-to spot for anyone who loves Thai food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mansoor B.,I really enjoyed the food. I had the green curry and khao soi. The curry had a perfect blend of spice and flavor. The environment was great and cultural. I would highly recommend you have a reservation because it is very crowded. Many walk ins had to wait. It's a not terribly priced but each dish is around 16-17 dollars.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aaliyah R.,"o m g their pad thai is amazing!!!! i came on a super busy weekend night, got seated at the bar, and still got good service despite me coming without reservations. it is a bit hard to get a water refill tho. everyone is friendly and i love how it looks inside. $16 for tofu pad thai and i got extra peanuts, the whole meal is so delicious and it's a lot! definitely worth it!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zaid R.,"I've been to Pai countless times now. I've tried most of their menu and my favourite item is their pad Thai.
I usually get the Thai Spicy which makes me teary but it's so worth it. Taste wise , this is the best Thai food I have had . The only down side is that the servings don't fill me up ( I tend to eat more than average folks).
For me this place is tied with Sukhothai. Pai has slightly better food by Sukhothai has more quantity. Both places are 5 out of 5 ... and are owned the the same people I believe.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jo Y.,First time i came here was awesome (summer 2018). 2nd time i came here was really average (recently). Agree with the previous posters who said the khao soi was too rich. had the exact same feeling! was a bit disappointing. feel like there're better options for sure.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Darien W.,"Pros: pad Thai choices, variety, staff, taste
Cons: busy and cramped depending when you go
Summary: worth going if you like pad thai! :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vidhi R.,Ordered a Khao Soi online and absolutely loved it! It had the best flavors + noodles + extra spice sauce on the side,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Benny K.,"It must have been good cause we was passed out. My Bae Nikki and I drank too much Chang Beer. 
Seriously now.  There are approximately two hundred and fifty five reviews and an unknown number of pics for this amazing restaurant. What else can I add. I have been their twice and do have plans on returning.  Yea there can be some wait times so go across the street to Byblos (I think that is what it is called) and have a couple twenty dollar drinks. They will call you on your cell when your table is ready. I know what else I can add. Pics that my other Bae Mamy took of me and Bae Nikki all hung up on Chang Beer. Peace out Yelpers!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeremy P.,"Pai is absolutely fantastic!
I've been three times now, and each time has been great. 
The Thai green curry is outstanding and they have the best spring rolls in Toronto.
The service is always great, but be prepared for long wait times during peak lunch and dinner hours. If there is a long line, takeout is also a great option. The restaurant is on Ritual for easy ordering, and a takeout order usually takes 25 minutes or so",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kris D.,"This warm, colorful, and full of life restaurant deserves a five star rating for excellent food, drinks, service, environment, and creativity. Delicious food, fresh, and the atmosphere for a Thai restaurant was totally not what you'd expect. It was more eclectic, but very warm and welcoming.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Betty W.,"I was very excited to try this place after reading all the fantastic reviews. Now That I have tried it, I feel responsible to write a real review.  
A underground small space pub like environment. Extremely loud, comparable to the loudest sports pubs in Toronto, not a family/kids friendly atmosphere (went on a Sunday eve). It's a great place for people in their 20s and under: comfortable with not hearing each other to avoid two-way conversations. It was busy. Service resembled a southern Chinese restaurant on Spadina, except they didn't throw plates at you.
Tried the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Tofu & Veggies with Thai spice level. Food came on time.
Overall the taste wasn't horrible and had a great texture. It was overly sweet, a ton of sugar went into the dish. The Thai Spice level, considered the spiciest level you can order barely tasted spicy. I estimated about 1 thai chilly went into the dish. I normally prefer about at least 8. My home-made pad thai is 100x better, with a ton more flavours and a lot less sugar. 
Will not return for the food, noise/atmosphere, price nor the service.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cyn E.,"Went to Pai over the weekend and got the tom yum soup. Delicious and packed with savory lemongrass flavor, shrimp and veggies.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeanny C.,"This was the first place in Toronto that my friends and I went right after we got off the plane. The decor is very cute and fitting to the setting of Thai food. The wait to be seated wasn't too bad for an afternoon on a Thursday. The wait for the food was a bit long, however when our friend arrived 40mins after us, her food came right out. 
I felt this was a great place for lunch. Is it the best Thai food I've ever had? Hard to say. To me, I am a bit snobby with taste. I don't like things too overpowering or under seasoning, on top of that it must be gluten free (Not by choice, Celiac disease). It was definitely delicious, I would highly recommend it. But it's not mind blowing or life changing. It's yummy Thai food. It's gluten free friendly, lots of options to choose from their limited menu. 
On the side note, Toronto has lots of great places to eat! Some with more creativity and originality than others!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Heather L.,"Delicious! They have a variety of curries and noodles that were all amazing! We went as a large group of almost thirty people and everyone loved it. I would go for the green curry with rice. 
They let you choose the spiciness level as well!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pascal K.,"Based on the reviewed, I though having to try this spot. Especially as I have made great experiences in this area before. 
The restaurant itself is a smaller square footage and below ground (as typical here). The interior is nicely designed and the music adequate for the surroundings. 
I had Tom Yum soup, spring rolls and Khao Pad Thamada with shrimp as a main. Personally I would just come back for the Tom Yum which was out of the world!! Spring rolls were well prepared and tasty as well. The Khao Pad was a recommendation by the staff (staffs favorite), overall it was quiet tasty but have expected it to be more saucy (it was quiet dry) but very great in flavor! Overall the staff was very professional, ingredients of high quality and the preparation great. Can only recommend trying!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna F.,"This place had a huge line waiting just to get in before it opened - it was SO worth it. I highly recommend the pad thai - sooo good. We also got the green curry which was phenomenal. The place filled up quick, but the service was fast. One of the best thai restaurants I've eaten at. Also grab a thai tea if you like a little sweetness. I do wish they had coffee, but the thai tea held me over. Also seems like a cute date location ;)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vickie S.,"Wow! What a surprise to get some of the best Thai food of my life in Canada. I ordered the Pad Gra Prow, which was a little out of my comfort zone as I'm a Pad Thai kind of gal. After I ordered I saw many of that same dishes being delivered throughout the restaurant. Obviously it's a very popular dish. It was absolutely delicious! Perfect amount of chicken (you can also get beef, shrimp or tofu) and perfect veggies rice and sauce. Very uniform. The sauce was amazing, but I ordered mild to be in the safe side. They gave me an additional container of chili sauce to adjust it my liking. I ended up using it all. So I would recommend medium spicy. I was a bit apprehensive about the egg. Boy was I wrong! That really made the dish! I know I will be dreaming of this dish for a long time to come.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura C.,"A huge disappointment. I went here with high expectations due to the Yelp reviews. The atmosphere was very rustic and happy with wooden furniture and a raptors stuffed animal, colourful lights, etc. I first ordered the thai milk tea, Im glad we shared it. It was expensive and it was so sweet to the point that it tasted like chocolate milk. The chicken khao soi was lukewarm and had so little egg noodles and chicken relative to the broth itself. Taste of curry was fine but unappetizing as it wasn't hot. The tom yum soup was also lukewarm despite that it was on top of a flame. It was so sour and spicy with zero complexity in flavour that we didn't finish most of it. The few shrimps were fresh and cooked well.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,A. K.,"What else is there to say, I agree with the hype! We split a few apps and drinks, and I highly recommend the khao soi. I've always been kind of eh on crispy noodles, but theirs are sooo good!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex W.,Best pad Thai and chicken satay I've ever tasted bar none! Haven't found anything even close in Los Angeles to PNTK. Love this place.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Charles D.,"If you like Thai food and you're in Toronto, go here.  I don't care how far away you are...you drop everything and go here.  
On the bartender's recommendation I went with the Tiger Shrimp (something I would never choose for myself) and Thai Green Curry with Chicken.  
The shrimp were crunchy and full of flavor - unlike most tempura shrimp.  And the Green Curry...I might have to fly back to TOR JUST to eat it again.  I think I'm in love. 
A little busy at lunch...had to wait 10 min to even get a bar seat but I was by myself, so NBD.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brandon Z.,"Amazing Thai food! This place is legit! It has become super popular so the wait is a little long so usually I go a bit earlier and they text you when the table is ready. 
The food is amazing! We had the squash fritters and spring rolls to share. I had the green curry in a coconut...wow! The coconut inside is amazing, don't forget to eat that part! 
The staff are super friendly. The Thai ice tea is one of the best I have ever tasted (including in Thailand)
Can't wait to go back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Betty N.,"This is one of my go to places for authentic Thai street food.
This location gets very busy for supper even on a weekday, but it is large enough to accommodate a lot of patrons.
My fav dishes are:  crispy basa filet (khao pla tawt), Pad thai, butternut fritters (Gra bong)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karys J.,"Hands down. Best Thai in Toronto thus far. We had the coconut green curry and chicken pad Thai, both medium spicy. Both dishes were amazing!! I particularly enjoyed the curry, which came inside a coconut bowl. The point is to scrape off the insides of the coconut by spoonfuls and devour along with the curry. Also, the portions were very good. 
In comparison to Khao San (which I also like!) Pai has a much larger seating space and scores higher on my favs list. I liked the food better here too. Also, the service was exceptional! 
Will be back soon. Way to go Pai!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kate S.,"Truly the best Thai restaurant in the city. 
We arrived around after 7 on a Wednesday night which was prime time. They do not take same day reservations. The wait was just about under an hour and decided to wait. You may sit by the bar and there is also a bench in another room that you can sit and wait. We waited about 45 mins unil we got to our table.
The vibe is very loud and they played great music. The decor was very cozy as if you are at your friend's house for dinner. I loved all the photographs on the wall.
They have daily drink specials. 
I ordered mango juice and and my bf ordered a beer. We could not decide on an appetizer so we had asked the server their favourite dish to which she suggested the battered squash. 
BTW unfortunately I do not remember the Thai names.
When it arrived, it looked like fritters and shoe strings. The dip was like a mixture of sweet chili sauce and fish sauce.  It was so delicious. What a great start to our dinner.
For our mains, we ordered the Khao Soi and or course, a curry fiend.. the Coconut Green Curry. It is served in a coconut.
My Coconut Green Curry was definitely the BEST in the city that I have ever had. 
I can also scrape off the coconut which soaked in all the flavors.  The Khao Soi was also so delicious.
I cannot wait to go back and try the other dishes. Also an awesome place for after work drinks! !!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anne S.,"Dont be late! The line is huge and the wait time is long! But the food is amazing! We order the grabong for appetizer and green curry in the coconut and pad gra prow for dinner. Both very good! Although I request my green curry to be mild, it was quite spicy. But the rice helped to balance it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bernadette D.,"Whats going on Pai? The serving of pad kra pow keeps shrinking. As i was eating it, i didnt get the same great feeling i used to get when eating here-- that of having a generous, homecooked meal. The serving of the meat has shrunk and i had to, at one point, just eat the eggs with rice. My friend ordered extra curry sauce and was charged $3. I dont know Pai...i just hope you bring back the restaurant we used to know and not let fame pull you down.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patrick D.,"My new favourite Thai resto!
This place is awesome. We had to wait 45 minutes to get seated as it was a Friday night and we (stupidly) didn't make resos. But they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready so you can actually leave and do things.
No wonder this place is busy. The ambiance and decor is fantastic - feels like you're actually in Pai, Thailand. The drinks were great, service was fantastic, and the food even better. We had deep fried squash to start (obviously) and I had a curry dish that was served in a coconut! (see picture).
The management like the Toronto Raptors so much that they actually have memorabilia up and the drink menu is named after players.
The Good:
1. Food. Amazing and fresh. Mad bonus points for the whole coconut.
2. Service. Our waitress was unbelievably friendly and even gave us tips on our upcoming trip to Thailand.
3. Decor. Great decor and really mashes with the vibe of the place.
The Bad (only because I gotta):
1. Queue. Make sure to make reservations - they are super busy and for good reason.
Recommendation: go here many times and try all items.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason W.,"This place was suggested to my wife and I by some foodie friends on a recent trip to Toronto. Give yourself plenty of time. We waited about 30 minutes to check-in and another 30 or so to get seated. We were able to find a corner of the bar to grab some drinks for the wait. Great atmosphere and decor. Be sure to read the story behind Pai that is in a few places of the restaurant. Our food was really good and we left with full, happy bellies!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vicki Y.,It's the worst service I've ever experience. I kindly ask the server for order but she just ignore me and give me a supercilious look. Other table all served water except us I have no idea what's wrong with her .  We had our lunch with no water and no dishes.  When my friends was ordering she's like taking the menu away and being impatient. I went Pai many times and I love the food but after today I will NEVER EVER go there again. This waitress ruined my day.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren H.,"A thai restaurant on King west with full of tasty dishes that are a little pricey. I've been here a couple times and I'm satisfied every time! It is almost always busy and the service isn't bad either. Pak boong fai deng (Morning Glory) was a little salty but good, Chef nuit pad thai is good too but I was never a huge fan of pad thai because of the little sweetness. Pad gra prow with crispy pork (Moo Grob) was my favourite! Had it made spicy and it really was spicy but enjoyed it. As for the Panang chicken curry, it was good but I'd still stick to my Pad gra prow!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maya L.,One of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto. The flavour in each dish is complex and visually appealing. I've been numerous times with friends and the quality of the food there never disappoints. Some of our favourites are the Khao Soi and Panang Beef Curry.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jane S.,"Great Thai restaurant in a superb location! 
My friend and I were walking along the lakeshore and when our tummy's started to rumble I knew just the place I wanted to try! Even on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm this place was BUSY but not too busy that there was a lineup. The interior may not be to some people's taste as it is very kitschy but I loved the decor and the staff are super friendly. 
I had a beef pad thai and my friend had a green curry. We asked for mild spice and it had just the right amount of kick. I also went for a lemongrass iced tea which was far too sweet for my liking. I would suggest staying away from the drinks if you are not a fan of sugar. Overall the food here was great! The flavours were strong and everything tasted pretty fresh. I would just suggest going during an off time to avoid the line ups and get faster service.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dario S.,"Wow...2400 reviews with a 4-1/2 average rating.  Now I know why.  Finally after hearing and reading all about Pai I got to experience it for myself.  Absolutely no doubt the best Tai restaurant I have ever been to.  Went for lunch with my wife and a friend of ours on a Friday afternoon.  This place was buzzing and was very busy but fortunately for us it was only a five minute wait.  We opted for traditional seating which was fun and really enhanced our dining experience.  For appetizers we shared the Kung Tawt (friend breaded black tiger garlic shrimp) and the Thai Chicken Wings (with crispy shallots, lemongrass and crispy chillies).  Both were excellent.  Fantastic flavours and great start to our meal.  For my main I had the Panang Beef Curry (Panang curry, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, red chilli and coconut milk served with jasmine rice).  What a fantastic dish.  It was a wonderful flavour explosion.  The staff was friendly with excellent service.  Definitely will be back again.  I highly recommend this place as it was an outstanding experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,gift y.,If you want good food - PAI is your best bet. My forever go to is the chef's Pad Thai! It's phenomenal and is always consistently great. I have never had a bad experience with PAI - always great to go in person as well as order in. The place is fun to visit due to it always being packed!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Simran J.,"UPDATE: 
Favourite thai place in Toronto. I came back with a few coworkers and decided to try the green curry, and the squash fritters. We all loved the squash fritters. Easily enough for 4 people. The tamarind sauce that comes with it is sweet and tangy - goes really well with the fritters. 
The green curry was amazing. Served in a coconut with a side of rice. The curry was sweet, a little spicy and perfectly creamy. Vegetables were still a little crunchy and a few tofu pieces. 
Service was friendly and quick, although we came in around 5PM. Highly recommend coming in or making a reservation the day before! 
 
This place fills up fast! Luckily I got here and got a seat with my friend at the bar! We got the sake bombs which I highly recommend them if you want to get decently drunk. I also the pad Thai which was pretty delicious. 
What I loved was the service. The bartender and server were very nice and we got our Food pretty quickly, which was awesome.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mel T.,"This is by far one of the best thai restaurants I have been to in Toronto. Their curry and pad thai are extremely flavourful and authentic. Coupled with their friendly staff, it makes the experience all the better. I personally have not seen noodles tied in a knot to be served in a dish before and thought that it was very pleasing to look at and eat! 
The reason why this place would lose a star is because i waited for almost 2hrs for a table for 5. To be fair, that is a relatively large group, but 2hrs does seem a little bit too long of a wait. 
I would definitely come back here in a smaller group or make reservations beforehand. Overall, the food, atmosphere and service was great.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda S.,Every time I have a bite of the pad Thai I can't help myself from making an audible mmmmmmmmmmm,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adrien J.,"Nice surprise to find a traditional thaï restaurant, same savors and delicious as in Bangkok finest places. It is less spicy than in Thailand but it is still too much for Toronto locals.
Beware of the crowd during lunch time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt D.,"Came to Toronto for a business trip and saw this place was highly rated and near my hotel. I decided to brave the cold and walk over after ordering online through the maegan app which was a breeze, and the food was ready before the specified time.
For a starter, I got the spring rolls, which were excellent. You would never know they were vegetarian because the inside was super savory and the outside was fried to crispy perfection. Highly recommend these as an appetizer.
I decided to keep it simple with the Chef Nuit Pad Thai for my main, and it did not disappoint. It was a bit sweeter than expected but that's OK, the chicken wasn't dry (which is a victory in and of itself) and I liked the thinner-than-usual noodles. 
My only complaints were the spice level and dinner menu selection. I ordered ""Foreigner Hot"" because I was a foreigner and love spicy food but there was basically no spice at all. If you call yourself a spicy food fan I'd opt for the Thai Spicy level. I also wish the dinner menu had some of the choices from the lunch menu, but this is just personal preference.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Celina L.,"Pai is one of two popular Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto. It's difficult to get a table, so I would recommend coming early, putting your name down, and then walking around the neighbourhood because the space to wait inside the restaurant is not very large.
A group of 4 of us waiting for approximately 45 minutes to get a table on a Saturday evening around 7/8pm. We ordered the Grabong ($14) to share among us four. Comprised of freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters lightly coated in red curry paste batter, deep fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with nuts, its a light dish that's enough to get your appetite ready for the main. 
I ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai as the main ($16.50) and it was a large serving that could have lasted me two dinners! It includes stir fried rice noodle in a home made tamarind sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts. Choice of Chicken, Beef or tofu and veggies. Don't forget to get extra limes and peanuts on the side- I find it helps bring out the flavour!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stacey S.,When I arrived the line was out the door so I was a little nervous about the wait. The line moved fairly fast and I was to the from in about 10 minutes. I was then given a buzzer and told it would be 15 minutes. This didn't seem too bad considering the line. I was sat at a table within 5 minutes. The food was really good and reasonable priced. I would definitely go back if I'm town again.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Junjun Z.,"Love the chef special curry, just wish they can have more spicy level to choose from.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew M.,"Hot damn, the official challenger to Suko Thai for Thai food supremacy might just be located on Duncan St in downtown Toronto! 
As part of what is regarded as the big three of Thai food restaurants in the T. (Suko Thai, Kao San Rd, and Pai) I had heard of but never been to Pai. Until today. And man, am I ever glad I went.
Located in the split basement level of a trendy downtown building it might not resemble the heavyweight contender it is on first blush, but after you go inside it gets a lot more serious. Heavy wood tables with powder steel adorn the inside which is decorated with Thai accents and wood detailing. There is a bar to the left for singles and those in for a quick drink or bite, and the table section is on either side of the bar. The staff is friendly, greets you right away and has you seated and with menus within minutes of your arrival.
The Food:
As mentioned, for me, the benchmark for Thai excellence is Suko Thai. But I have to say after eating at Pai, we've officially got a tie (Get it? I know, terrible. Moving on!). I ordered the Pad Thai which had its own homemade tamarind sauce, which is excellent. The portion is ridiculous. It's a mammoth pile of noodles, bean sprouts, tofu and chicken (You choose between chicken, beef, or veggie. Shrimp is $2-3 extra). It comes with a side of dried cabbage (I think that's what it was). And it's all good. Like, really fricken' good!
Next, the spring rolls. Artistically plated and delicious to a criminal degree, they are served with a sweet Chilli sauce which is on its own pretty damn good as well.
Service was attentive, food arrived quickly. Severs were friendly, too. Were a little slow with the bill at the end, but this was after they got incredibly busy (the restaurant naturally fills up during dinner service). 
Atmosphere, service, food: Incredible. GO!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jim U.,Not what I expected in terms of atmosphere but I liked it. It seems more like a North woods basement bar than a Thai place. Very busy which is always a good sign. Service was spot on including a few recommendations. Nice to see a full list of drinks including local beers. My only complaint is being seated right next to another 2 top while there were several other options. By the time we left the place it was full though. The small tables are awfully close and I know WAY too much about the ladies that we sat next to.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica K.,"SOOO GOOD!!
Make a reservation beforehand it gets quite busy... 
Try the chicken fried rice with the braised beef soup thing -can't remember the name! But sooooo creamy with perfect flavour. Oh yeah and don't forget to get the squash fitters for the appetizer!!!!  
Food came quickly:) 
Service was also great!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eileen C.,"When I was in Toronto last summer this was a place that I really wanted to try because of the yelp reviews and the line outside the door. This summer I ended up making a reservation and there was no wait. I was really excited to finally try this place. We were seated very quickly and got drinks quick too, only issue with our table was that it was sticky. My party and I decided to do family style. We ordered the Khao soi, Tom yum soup, gaeng masaman with braised beef, and khao pad thamada. It took over 45 minutes for our food to finally be ready. When we finally got our food the khao soi was tasty but lukewarm- we couldn't get the attention of the waitress so we just ate it. I think overall I expected too much out of this place and probably will not be back.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Annie G.,"Waited 40 minutes for a table, got a drink at the bar while we waited. 
We ordered so many dishes because we were MARVED! Service was friendly and on point, atmosphere was like a Thai/Hippie/Hawaiian/retro vibe, pretty cool stuff on display! Good vibes, great service!
We got all the salads on the menu, the beef salad was delicious! Beef was perfectly cooked and the flavours were insane. The papaya salad was also packed with flavour and freshness. 
Sticky rice is a must!
The laap salad was my favourite, before we took a bite we were debating to ask the waiter if it came with a sauce to put on but we bit into and realized with that much flavour it was definitely not needed!
*****!!!!!!Their oxtail is to die for!!!!!!!*****
The green curry came in a fresh coconut and it was probably one of the best curries I've had. Light and creamy with big chunks of chicken.
The pad Thai was my least favourite, it was good and we only ordered it because we wanted to compare to other Thai places we've hit up. 
Definitely worth the wait, go now!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Branden S.,Heard the food was good and definitely didn't disappoint. I have only 1 spot I go to for Thai and this restaurant makes it 2. The price point for Thai food is a bit on the higher side in my opinion. The phad Thai portion was a bit small. The flavor is so rich and the bean sprouts are a great balance. I was able to try the chicken fried rice that  was mistakenly given which had more flavor and the chicken was more moist compared to the beef. Recommend the chicken rather than the beef for the fried rice. The Thai chicken wings are very good. The crunch from the fried garlic added a nice touch. Important tip. Kill the wings while it's hot. The atmosphere is loud and fast paced. They have a large selection of beers and spirits so great for a night out. They also have curry which I believe they're known for that I didn't try.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patricia Y.,"So happy that Yelp led us to possibly the best Thai food in Toronto! There is definitely a ""vibe"" in this restaurant - the music was a little loud, the tables were very close together, and it seems to cater to younger people, but we had no problems with it. It was packed during lunch time, and I expect probably during dinner time as well, so plan accordingly.
The menus were colorful and descriptive -- my boyfriend has a deadly shellfish allergy, and they were able to accommodate his allergies by taking out oyster sauce and shrimp paste (with no detriment to the taste), so A++ for that. We ordered the chicken pad thai (YUM, BEST EVER!), and the braised beef Khao Soi. I've never had such good Khao Soi -- they said that they were sold out of chicken drumsticks, but I bet it's even better with the drummies. The prices are a little expensive for lunch, but it is SO WORTH IT. Would absolutely come back again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kaixin Z.,"Hands down one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto, as I'm sure you'll come to see from the usual lineup out the door! 
Everything on their menu that I've tried has been great but I highly recommend the beef noodle soup! Better than most of the food I actually had in Thailand!
The atmosphere is definitely pretty vibrant and loud as the place is usually packed but the prices are very fair and the dishes are definitely worth.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,S J.,"One of the best Thai food restaurants outside of Thailand we ever have had! Judy was an excellent waitress who also gave us Toronto other foodie locations. Coming from Los Angeles, we have really experienced why Toronto is considered one if the premier cities in the world.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sameer B.,"My favourite Thai restaurant in the city! The Kao Soi is by far my favourite!
Really authentic, fresh food. The 5 times I have gone over the past year, I have not been disappointed. Unfortunately, they don't have Singha anymore, but that shouldn't deter you from the food!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kathy C.,"The place is always packed. It took a more than 3 attempts before I had the opportunity to try Pai. I turned away the first 3 times because the line was too long. 
The food was flavourful. However, I found the price to bit a little pricey for Thai food. There were also a little people crammed into a small space. It was hard to have a good conversation.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Frances D.,"I've wanted to come to Pai for a while now after hearing such rave reviews. Having tried places like Sukho Thai and Khao San Road, I had high expectations since I love Thai food but Pai did not disappoint in the slightest! 
We got there a little after 6pm to beat the dinner rush and luckily we did since after we were seated, the line grew two-fold and you can feel the room getting increasingly louder. It definitely has more of a party atmosphere so not the best place if you are someone looking for a quiet dining experience. 
But it's fun, lively, and full of personality. They even have a small marketplace in the back where you can get some food items to go and other knick knacks. 
We ordered the squash fritter as an app along with their signature pad thai with shrimp and chicken. Everything was absolutely delicious. The pad thai just got better and better with every bite! The quality was definitely the best I've ever tried. All the dishes are jam packed with flavor and left us wanting more. The squash fritter (which they also have at Khao San Road) were so well seasoned, crunchy on the outside and sweet inside. Highly addictive! I recommend checking this place out and coming early to snag a table!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Charley N.,"Pai is the best Thai food restraint in toronto. Hands down. They have great flavourful dishes and ask you how spicy you want it. Pai was the same chefs as khao san road but one big difference - they treat you like they want your business.  Even appreciate it.  Stop by for a good meal any time, pro tip, take out and you'll eat faster!  You can get their food on Uber eats too, but it often comes cold so pick it up yourself if you can!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle N.,"Love the layout and feel of this place, it was very charming basement restaurant.
Some of our faves:
-Tom yum soup, served 4 just fine. We ordered medium but it was pretty spicy for a medium. Good shrimp and veggies in the soup
-Chicken pad thai - nice and large portion, not clumpy or greasy at all
-Grabong, piles and piles of fried squash goodness - with a tasty tamarind sauce. Server recommended this as it was their most popular app
Service was great! We highly recommend this place for a quick lunch!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rina K.,"Came here at 6:00pm on a Wednesday night. We didn't have a reservation but they were able to seat us right away at the bar. Overall the food tasted a notch better than any Thai food I've had in the past (never been to Thailand though). The interior was cozy, but loud. Must order with any meal is the Thai iced tea--it's excellent here!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andy D.,"Amazing food! To busy all the time though. We had to wait some 20 minutes for a table of 4. It's my favourite Thai restaurant. I've enjoyed everything I've ordered. Super delicious and full of flavours in each bite. Their khao soi is my favourite in town 
The service was attentive and they got us drinks to start and kept refilling our water throughout the night. 
Must try if you love Thai​ food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steven F.,"Pretty hipster Thai restaurant in Toronto, reminds me of some of the places found in LA. The restaurant is dimly lit, but definitely noisy, and looks to be always crowded as my friends and I stopped by on a Wednesday night. 
We all decided to share a couple of plates; beef salad, khao soi with chicken, pad thai with beef, and pad gra prow with crispy pork. All in all, they were all pretty delicious, the beef salad was cooked medium rare, and was very tender. The Khao Soi had that nice coconut taste, noodles were pretty al dente and the broth itself was rich and thick. The pad gra prow is definitely a must with crispy pork! Pad Thai will taste exactly like it should.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Q R.,"One of my friends suggested that we have a dinner at this place as they offer excellent Thai cuisine. As soon as I got here at around 6 pm, I was first pleased with their exciting and fun decoration, then the friendly greeting and services from the staff members.
I was surprised to hear that they were fully booked on early Tuesday evening, but my friend and I didn't mind the bar seats as it was spacious and clean. 
We both got Khao Soi, which had great curry flavor with creamy texture. I really enjoyed the dish, and would recommend this place to any of my friends. I almost feel like they deserve 5 stars, but I'm settling with 4 because the place can be quiet noisy without any loud music playing in the background. It definitely would be a fun place to come with a large group of friends, or a date who you don't mind sitting very close to.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arianne M.,"I work on Bay & Adelaide and always come right when it comes to make sure I get a table. The lines are crazy long but with good reason. Everything is so yummy. I have basically tried everything on the menu and have never been disappointed with my order. 
I just wish I could order the crispy basa fillet on it's own! It's so nice and crispy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny Y.,"Decided to visit Pai with a few friends. Note that we have high expectations for Thai food, and this place pretty much nailed it! 
We were all pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was, and how authentic it all tasted! The restaurant atmosphere was a bit on the noisy side, but with the unique decor, friendly staff and good food, it definitely made up for it! 
The northern Thai sausage is a must try! The hint of lemongrass in it was just perfect. We also got the papaya salad which was good although I would have liked it to be a bit spicier. For those who have never had a Thai papaya salad, note that they have a bit of a fishy smell due to the dried shrimp. Otherwise it's something new to try! 
My main was the green curry chicken which was delicious! It was nicely spiced, with just the right amount of the coconut flavour. We then had dessert- the mango sticky rice. It was okay, but it was bit too sweet with the overload of coconut milk. It could have also tasted better with some sesame seeds on top. 
Overall, I was impressed with the authenticity of the food. I wish we tried the morning glory (one of my fav Thai dishes), but that will be my excuse to come back! Definitely a bonus with the good service, 4/5!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ben S.,"Average Thai restaurant. Prices are way too expensive. Pad Thai should not be $17.50, and it's greasy. Not worth spending this much money on takeout food.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ji T.,"my party and i arrived hungry after escaping from the terminal island, we sought after libations and refreshments for our famished stomaches..
we walked cautiously underground and placed our names down for a number...
""an hour wait"" the door goblin said. We've faced worst hungers before and we're not backing down...
so we waited, half a moon past, the bellows of our hungering stomach echoed throughout the underground cavern....there must be something we can do, thought Da Vid, our rogue..
Using his powers of trickery and deception, Vid negotiated with his tongue and our party was magically bumped to the next in line
i asked for the chicken pad thai, a classic staple in goblin thai cuisine. The dish arrives, i also ordered a sake for my thirsty throat
everything was great, the food was satisfying and the drink quenched my thirst. We never saw the service goblin after placing our order and delivering our refreshments...but then again, i do not expect much on a busy night
after placing a bag full of coins down to pay for the meal, our party walks out ready for our next adventure. Vid was already exhausted from previous exploits at terminal island was desperately seeking shelter by the riverbanks of mississauga",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Iris A.,"I love this place so much, its my Top Pick for Toronto.
Food is sooo good - can not describe it with words, you need to try it!
We went there for lunch, there was a huge line and wait was approximately 20-25 minutes. My daughter loves loud music so she enjoyed waiting in a cute waiting area. Guys if you have a stroller, do not bring it - because it is basically walk down the stairs type of place. Interior is decorated in modern way. Nice staff, even if there is long wait the food and cocktails are out in no time!
I ordered Green Coconut Curry and sangria, oh my goodness it was beyond good! :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rita K.,"I've been here twice and it's always packed! The thing I like about Pai that's different from Sukho Thai and Khao San Road is that they take reservation (unless that has changed recently).
As a party of three, two of us got chicken pad thai with medium spice and my other friend tried their Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. We also shared a thai iced tea which was comparable to authentic thai iced tea you could get in Thailand (according to my friend).
Overall, I thought the food was quite delicious and flavourful. 
During my other visit, I tried the Pad Gra Prow which I actually really enjoyed as well. I will definitely be back in the future.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny K.,"Best food I've maybe ever had. My husband and I visited for a weekend over Labor Day. We went Sunday around 5:30 and waiting in line to get a table, told them we'd be willing to sit at the bar... glad we did because we were sat immediately. I had the green curry (comes in a coconut) and my husband had something else. Great flavor. Excellent service. I'll be back to Toronto just to eat here. Recommend it a million times",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marie M.,"Was here on a Friday evening for dinner, waited about half an hour for a table. The area beside the main bar is now a waiting area (was wondering why at first). Then after realized, the restaurant expanded. The waiter brought us to the other side of the other side of the restaurant which is the quieter side. The decor was really nice with the lights and the space is bigger than khao san road. As for the food, I think it went downhill compared to before. Maybe because the space is bigger now? Ordered the spring rolls--3/5, not freshly made. The Satay Skewers- 3/5, the meat was too soft. The  Beef Pad Thai- 3/5, not as much flavour compared to before.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dani M.,"The best Thai restaurant in Toronto!
The green curry with jasmine rice is just perfect and makes you want to come back for more
I usually order in, the food arrives well packed and warm 
My favourite dish is the fish but it's not always that it's available ... so if you see it's on the menu, grab it while you can and make sure to add some spring rolls!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel K.,"Had the green curry. Presentation and atmosphere  was astounding, the place was huge and packed. My family enjoyed their meal while I did not. The bamboo shoots, tofu and vegetables I had and tasteless, the only good part of the meal was the curry and the rice. In my opinion it is too expesive for its price point; the green curry was 17.50.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris M.,"So much hype around this restaurant and all totally justified. Given the crowd of people lining up outside, we were expecting at least an hour wait for the 3 of us but were told it would be around 25 minutes. I figured that was a gross underestimation but turns out it was pretty accurate. The restaurant has a lot more seating than I thought and they do a great job moving people through. Service is excellent!
I ordered the Khao Pla Tawt (crispy fish fillet with 2 sauces) and it was simply perfect. I have to say the atmosphere makes this place just as much as the food does. The entire restaurant is covered in decor that I'm pretty sure was taken straight out of Thailand. I'm trying to describe the vibe but I know my words won't do it justice. All I have to say is come here to experience it yourself!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Justin V.,"OVERRATED!
After a broken queue system (where I saw numerous people cut because there's no clear answer as to where the line starts or begins) and a long wait, we sat and began with some drinks: a thai iced tea (good flavor, not too sweet) and PAI Sangaria (quite tasty but maybe a little pricey for what you're getting unless you order the pitcher). 
We ended up going with grabong which was interesting and pretty addicting. It was a pretty large portion for two people but we ended up finishing most of it before our other two dishes came. We followed up with the khao soi with braised beef. We both found it very similar to your typical curry but maybe slightly thicker. We went with the medium because my girlfriend doesn't do that well with super spicy but it was essentially mild. Looking back, we should have went a little hotter. The beef itself was quite boring and and tough in terms of texture.  Next came the pad gra prow with crispy pork. The texture of the rice was off; dry and cold, borderline stale. I didn't find the flavor and style of the crispy pork to be too different from Hong Kong style roast pig which you could get for a lot cheaper elsewhere. 
All in all, I didn't the experience at Pai to be a ""bring me back to Thailand"" experience. Perhaps it is because I have been spoiled with a plethora of authentic thai restaurants in Los Angeles. To be fair, if Pai was in Philadelphia, I'd probably go more often. If it was in LA, I don't think I'd go as much as I'd go to Night + Market.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dan M.,"I'm obsessed with this place. I'd go all the time if I worked closer but my coworkers and I order from Ritual there once a week.
The Khao Soi with chicken is perfect. I love the crunchy stuff they put in it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,RIchard B.,"Just love this place.
Must go place on friday night with frnds.
I had pad thai, and it definitely satisfied me.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arjun A.,"One of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eaten at in North America! I might even go as far as to say this is the BEST and I've tried Thai food in Thailand. If you're in Toronto, you have to stop here for a meal. 
We ordered the chicken satay, crispy garlic shrimp, grabong (the crispy stringy thing you see in the pictures), and the khao soi braised beef. The flavors were out of this world. The soup in the khao soi was spicy and intense with coconut and Thai flavors. Almost every dish we ordered was phenomenal. The grabong is an awesome appetizer to start because you literally get a big bush of it, and everyone can just start grabbing at little strings and dipping them into the spicy/tangy sauce. 
As others have said in their reviews, the wait time to be seated is very long. But that's not a problem for me. I'd rather wait 45 minutes and eat some of the best food in the world than be rushed to a seat. It shouldn't detract you from coming here either. Just plan ahead. Also long lines are usually a sign of high-quality food, just saying.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Huda A.,"Good good and GOOD! 
This place is the closest thing to an authentic Thai food!
Their pad thai is amazing and their pad kra pao (thai fried basil) 
If you love SPICY then get the 'thai spicy'
I have also tried their masaman which is good (but pretty creamy and fatty) as well as their 'kao soi' Let's just say most of the food on the menu is GREAT!
The prices are a a little high and the wait time can be extremely long but the wait is definitely worth it! The atmosphere is very loud and a little dark (might not be great for younger kids)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie C.,"Amazing experience at Pai! The place was much larger and busier than expected; however, the food gods were in my favor and we got sat right away at a shared table in the back. It was nice to have a slightly quieter atmosphere to talk but walking through the entire restaurant I couldn't help but notice how bustling it was. It did remind me of the busy street markets in Thailand. Service was great. Food was excellent! The perfect amount of heat and sweetness in the curry. Definitely would go again and recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kaitlyn R.,This restaurant is a MUST! One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto and it's the best Thai food hands down. I got the Chicken Pad Thai with medium spice and it was delicious! The restaurant is busy but the food and service was great. I'll definitely be going back for sure!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yvonne L.,"The atmosphere, the ambiance, the lively aspect the interior everything about it was great and mostly the food was impeccable. I'd definitely come here again for a lively night but prefer for next be dinner and would love to sit at at the tables with pillows!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James K.,"Excellent and casual, fun Thai spot. Very busy though, food is very good for the most part.
The coconut soup comes served in an actual hollowed out coconut, that's impressive!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara S.,"Ordered the Tom Yum Goong and Pad Thai for take out for the first time. Very authentic and generous portions, and food was prepared earlier than expected. 
The restaurant itself is chaotic and packed, so I wouldn't eat there if I wanted a nice quiet meal. Great for hanging out with friends and having drinks with your food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yanky L.,"The place is decent, good atmosphere, a bit crowded meaning there is little space between you and the next table.  Much larger than it appears from the front.  Service was lacking a bit, even water took 20 minutes on a weekday evening.  The food was fine, its not like it was mind blowing better than the next mom and pops Thai place. Ox tail being on the menu was a pleasant surprise as it was not a dish you see often which is what I ordered.  Taste was fine but then quantity wasn't there to be filled.  Ox tail has alot of bone which was expected but then I also expected them to have more pieces in there to make up for that.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jorge L.,"I'm not completely impressed, but I wasn't disappointed either. There's a lot of tapa-style dishes with tape-like portions. To be completely full, you need to order a lot of food. Many people seem to like it, so it could be just my orders. We got two appetizers and two main dishes along with two servings of rice.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anita A.,"We really enjoyed this restaurant.  We had the squash fritters for appetizer, which were amazing.  For dinner, the beef curry dish was one of the best we've had a Thai restaurants.  The pai Thai was fine, not as good as the curry dish.  The kids had the spring rolls, chicken wings, sticky rice and jasmine rice and all were very good.
The service was very good and the music was great!
Ps.  The iced tea is nestea.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alison Y.,"This very well may be the best Thai food I've ever had! This was the first place that I had marked when I started planning my vacation to Toronto and I can easily understand how this establishment earned it's nearly 5 star rating with 1000+ reviews. I came with a group of 4 and everything we had tasted amazing. We tried the kung tawt (tiger shrimp) and tom yum soup for appetizers. Both were super flavorful and cooked perfectly. The tom yum was the tastiest that I've had in my life!
For entrees, we tried the pad thai, pad gra prow with beef, and green curry with chicken. Everything was spot on in terms of flavor with the pad thai being my favorite. It (like the tom yum soup) is the most flavorful pad thai I've ever had. If I could rename the dish, I'd change it to crack pad thai because I just wanted more and more of it. I actually ordered this pad thai again to go on my way to the airport because I just had to have it again before I left Toronto lol! 
The place is well decorated and really emulates the ethnic culture of Thailand. It's got a lot of trinkets to look at all over the restaurant making this an ideal place to take anyone coming in town to visit or a place to have an ethnic food adventure! This for sure will be one of the first places I hit up when I come to Toronto again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Warren B.,"The sweat is still pouring off my brow as I effortlessly lick the bottom of my coconut curry bowl. My damn tongue isn't long enough to reach the bottom!
This food is SO good! The best Thai cuisine I have had ever. 
I'm Ukranian, so I know Thai food!
Trust me. 
It's good. It's priced good too.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tong J.,"PAI is Chef Nuit's latest venture and we were excited to sample the menu for their soft opening.  The menu has our all time favourites, Squash Fritters, Red Flame Morning Glory, Pad Thai and, of course, Khoa Soi.  The new items include, Moo Ping [Northern Thai sweet grilled pork on skewer], Gaeng Hunglay [pork belly curry with ginger and roasted peanut].  
Everything was delicious, like a home cooked meal in Northern Thailand.  Chef Nuit has high standards for her food and this new restaurant is no exception.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jesse L.,"Known to be one of the top Thai places in Toronto, it did not disappoint. In addition to the menu of Thai classics, Pat has an area for quick-serve dishes that are great for people looking for a fast grab and go.
Great food, excellent service and interesting decor. The only area of concern is the pricing, which runs higher than expected. Guess that's downtown for ya! (The minimum wage hike probably didn't help either).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Itanni B.,"I have come to the realization that I know very little about Thai cuisine. Only recently did I begin to read about Thai cuisine and about how dishes are 'supposed"" to taste like. For example, pad Thai is not supposed to be pink! And it is not supposed to taste like tomato - and certainly not ketchup! Have I really been living under a rock all these years? Wow.
So, having a bit more knowledge on the subject, I decided to check-out Pai, a Thai restaurant currently getting a lot of media attention. Though I really don't think anyone is surprised since Nuit and Jeff Regular, the owners of Pai, are also the team behind Sabai Sabai and Sukhothai (they were also heavily involved with Khao San Road - a hugely popular restaurant in Toronto until 2013). I have yet to visit Khao San Road, Sabai Sabai and Sukhothai, but believe me, a visit is in the works.
Let me tell you what I thought of my experience at Pai...
What I LOVED
They take reservations!
The prices are reasonable - every main is under $20
The portions are good - even took some to go for lunch the next day
The staff was friendly and service was efficient
The music was awesome! We all agreed that if they had the music for sale, we would all have purchased it
They do separate bills
They are accommodating when it comes to allergies or when you want an ingredient omitted. For example, I hate onions so I did not want onions in my food, one guest has a gluten intolerance so she has to stay away from food that contains or touches gluten, and a second guest was allergic to shellfish - the three of us were able to enjoy a delicious dinner with the items we cannot have omitted from our dishes
And the best part...
The food was fricking delicious! As in ridiculously good!
I ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai ($14) sans onions with chicken and holy hell, I don't know what crap I had been eating before, but whatever it was, I could never eat it again. This Pad Thai was made with fried rice noodles, home-made tamarind sauce, beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts. I think I am going to have to figure out how to make the tamarind sauce so that I could slather it on everything! Put it on my toast? Sure! At one point I turned to my neighbor and offered her some. First she said she only wanted a small bite, and then she asked for a second, and finally she called our waitress over and asked for an order of the Pad Thai to go.
What I did NOT love so much
Beer options are limited and not very good. Not a single IPA on the menu
The seats are not very comfortable and when you sit down it feels like the chair may break
The space can get crowded and loud - though I noticed that the chairs in the main dining area (we were seated in a more private part of the restaurant to the left), were sturdier looking. :)
When sitting with a large group, as I was, it felt like we were almost sitting on each other's laps
My guests complained about the spice levels being off. Specifically, several of my guests wanted their food super spicy and ordered the Farang Spicy (foreigner spicy), and did not find it spicy at all
Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Pai, and after experiencing what real Thai food should taste like, I am eagerly anticipating my next Thai food adventure. Now I just have to decide which of these restaurants I should check out next: Khao San Road, Sabai Sabai or Sukhothai?",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ali G.,"Pregnant girlfriend and I both got mild food poisoning the next day after ordering takeout. Had chicken pad Thai and green curry. 
Don't know if we'll  risk it again.  Disappointing to say the least.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Payal D.,"The hype is real
I've eaten Thai quite a few places and nobody comes close to this joint. Make sure you get there earlier than lunch/ dinner rush starting otherwise you will wait. 
Chef Nuit had outdone herself. Dishes made to perfection. No complaints. 
Best. Thai. Ever. Believe it.
We will be back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily C.,"Since my trip to thailand a few years back I've been looking for a great spot in Toronto! Found it! i went on a Bumble BFF meet-up and it was perfect! 
Good Thai food and friendly service in downtown Toronto. Get down the stairs and feel transported to a little part of Thailand. The decor is nice and charming, and service was efficient. My meet up was on a saturday & it was busy but the staff were still super attentitve.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carissa G.,AHmazing!!! The massaman was beyond fantastic!!! Worth the long wait! Can't go back to try other menu items!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea F.,"Best Pat Thai that I have tried! 
The only drawback is that the space is very small so ideally, you need to book in advance to avoid long waits.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alice Y.,"One of the best Thai food place in town. There are hit and miss in term of food quality. But overall I like this place.
-Curry rice is delicious. it is used a real coconut as a container, which is quite unique. 
- OX Tail is my favorite dish. It is a non spicy dish. 
-Thai ice tea is very sweet. It is too sweet for me and my friends. They could not do less sweet because they are premade already.
-Kao sai- I am very disappointed at this dish even tho most yelper love it. It is very thick and heavy. Coconut favor is too overpower for the rest of ingredients. 
--There  are always lineup if you come after 6pm. However, if you choose to sit at non alcohol area, wait time is less.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joseph H.,Very good thai food! The chicken curry is very creamy and tasty. Definitely recommend!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex Catherine L.,"DELICIOUS! i would come back to try everything on the menu. The curry is flavorful, the prices are really good for everything you get. It looks like there's not much but it's really filling. The decor is dreamy ans the service is great!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lilly C.,"I actually had a few good PAST experiences with this restaurant. I guess it's true that one negative experience trumps any number of positive experiences, leading to my writing this review.
Most recently, I ordered on Ritual the green curry and pad thai for some friends and I. The ones who had the green curry were food poisoned. It wasn't fun, I can tell you. I imagine we weren't the only ones, as the restaurant looked really busy - unless this is just the luck of Ritual.
Needless to say, I will never return to Pai again.
Good luck, fellow restaurant-goers, on the diarrhea roulette.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gelli A.,Best Thai restaurant in the area! Food is delicious and service is great. I love the green curry in coconut.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ellen C.,"I give Pai a 4/5 simply for their pad thai. It's out of this world! By far, the best pad thai I've ever had in Toronto! It's better than Khao San Road and their's pretty good before they changed their menu. 5/5
The chiang mai beef noodle soup was okay. The braised beef wasn't as tender as I would have liked it, but the soup had a good mix of sweet and salty. 3.5/5
The Khao soi was flavourful, but the sauce was too thick for my liking. It was very heavy so I just ate the noodles separately from the sauce. I think I liked Khao San Road's better. 3.5/5
We also ordered the thai ice tea. It wasn't as sweet as Khao San Roads, which I liked, but my only beef with it was it had too much shaved ice ! 3.5/5
I'll be coming back for the pad thai no doubt!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elsa C.,"This is my go-to Thai place in the city, my favourite for sure! I've been to all the other Thai places but Pai has THE BEST Pad Gra Prow dish. It's a rice dish that you can make mild, medium, or spicy. I usually get mild and it's tolerable with just a little kick of spice. I've tried medium once and you can taste the spice at that level so if you don't take spice very well, you will not enjoy the medium spice level. I usually order the Chicken Pad Gra Prow and it never disappoints! I've probably ordered this dish 15 times now. I've tried this dish at other Thai places and they don't make it as good as they do here!
As for the other dishes, I've also tried the Pad Thai which I think is average and the Green Curry which I think is made really well here too!
The line can get super long during dinner time so best to make a reservation if you can. Otherwise, there's usually a walk-in wait for about an hour during prime dinner time. You can leave your name and number though if you do end up walking in and just hang around Queen street and do some shopping until they give you a text.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Athena T.,"Delicious!! 
Service was okay -- but it was a busy Friday night. 
The food is some of the best Thai food I've had in Toronto.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Justin T.,"While on my way to my favourite pita place on Richmond for lunch, I saw the signs for Pai Northern Thai Kitchen and remembered that it's on my ""to try"" list. I couldn't resist!
I ordered take out and while the food takes a while to come out (15 minutes or so) it's fresh and delicious! I ordered the Panang Chicken (although I ended up getting beef instead due to a mistake with my order). It was fresh, delicious and very flavourful.
The restaurant is ideally located and is just off King Street on Duncan. I work in the area and it's actually not too easy to find a decent takeout option in the area. I will drop by for dinner soon as it looks like a fun, friendly place to have a meal. The decor is really cool and combines traditional Thai decor with a modern twist.
Considering they are only open a short time, the staff have really gotten on their feet already and are fast, efficient and friendly. Four stars despite the food mix-up, I can't wait to try the dinner menu.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer Z.,"Best Thai food I have ever tasted. Came here several times and it's super busy. You're lucky if you get a table. I love their shrimp pad Thai with extra shrimp and peanuts. It is the bomb. I cannot find another Thai restaurant with better shrimp pad Thai than here. 
Their cocktails are amazing too. 
The service can be a bit slow here. Me and my guests have waited almost 45 minutes for our main courses one time. Again.. you're lucky if you're not standing on the staircase waiting one hour for a table.
Also, parking is right in front of the restaurant. I've never had an issue with parking when I come here even on weekends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny L.,"An amazing restaurant. Waited around 5 minutes to be seated and another 20 minutes for the food to come but the wait was not bad at all. Ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai w/ Chicken and I absolutely loved it! ""Foreigner spicy"" added a great taste. Ambience and decor of the restaurant was unique and lively, and our server was very friendly. Loved this place!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniela A.,"Amazing food and experience! I love trying new dishes and I am so glad I found this place! It is not cheap, but it offers you the best service and the flavours are just amazing, so it worth to pay ""extra"" ! I would change the ""$$"" rating to ""$$$$"" but it still my favourite Thai in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nayoung R.,"Terrible service at Pai today. I've made a reservation for a table weeks ahead for a special occasion. Otherwise, I've always done walk-ins and and no problem waiting as it is my favorite Thai place. I was so looking forward to enjoying a dinner with my parents and it turned into a huge disappointment. 
We were seated at a tiny table right behind the host's stand, within arms reach of their phones and computers and no ceiling light above us. I don't even understand why they would even place a table there. 
When asked to move, they said there were no other tables available and told to stand and wait with the rest of walk-ins if I wanted to wait for a different table. 
What made me even more mad was that in 5 minutes TWO tables became available around us! So I asked again. This time, I was told those tables were for larger number of guests, while they were seating groups of two people in those tables as well as already seated group of two in another table that were big enough for six! 
Rather than ruining our dinner, we decided to just sit in our table and have a good meal. But it got worse. Their on tab beer was warm and our Pad thai appeared to be sitting for a while after it was cooked. The server was not apologetic at all when we said the beer was warm and made a face when I asked for a spoon which she previously took away by mistake! 
Don't get me wrong, I love their food. But I don't think I'll be returning for a while. I hope they realize that they'll be losing customers fast if their quality of customer service doesn't match up with their quality of food.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle K.,"Amazing find in Toronto! 
Sat at the bar and ordered a few beers while enjoying curry, noodles, fried shrimp, chicken skewers and the best sticky rice with mango I've ever had! 
Note: this place gets packed around 6pm. Make reservations or arrive prior to 5:30 to get a seat. 
Another note: part of the restaurant does not have an alcohol license so depending on your plans for the night, it may be faster to sit there!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joellen S.,The best Thai food ever. We had a sweet potato appetizer that was yummy and the split some fried rice and curry. All of us at the table were eating like there was no tomorrow. The food was so scrumptious. Flavor just right. Nice sized portions. Servers were prompt and friendly.  Divine.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Teresa K.,"Nice place.  It's huge, and you have to go down a big set of stairs, as it's below ground level.  The wait For a table, though, was atrocious.  The host lied to us, and said we'd be seated fairly quickly, but it was 30 minutes later that we finally were led to our table.  
That was also a bit weird 'cause we were put in a separate, private room, but seated at one long table with another party.  
So, my first impression was not positive, but I felt better after the good came.  Everything was really tasty. Portions were quite large.  I only ate half my portion.  Service was good too.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katty T.,"Great food great atmosphere. We tried their betel salad for the first time today - nicely done! Service was meh this time, other times have been better - but we will come back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sae Rom J.,Love love love their pad thai. Very saucy and flavourful. Best pad thai I had in Toronto. Also ordered green curry and fried rice. Fried rice had a slight sticky texture but it did not stick to my teeth which I liked. Green curry also above my expectation.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arthur L.,"A pleasant restaurant for a relaxing date for valentines day
I can see why this restaurant is often compared with khao san road due to its similarities in the menu and its location. However, the taste of the food, environment and service are completely different. 
I found that Pai Northern had an amazing atmosphere compared to khao san road where the waiters do not provide polite service and dont even get me started on those lineups for such a tiny restaurant. Its freezing outside! 
Once inside, the lighting and mood was a lot more relaxed. I liked how every table had their own little candlelight and everything was clean. Couple had their own table and I could hear my girlfriend without having to shout. I ordered the Pad Thai and she ordered the Khao Soi (I think that's how its spelt) and both of it came in great portions. 
The flavour was amazing my pad thai had perfect combinations of spice, sweetness and crunch that it wasn't overwhelming but balanced. This was very filling and I can imagine many people not being able to finish this dish on their own. 
For the two dishes, we paid somewhere around $33 dollars and I would love to come back and try the coconut green curry. All in all, I felt that this was definitely the better alternative than khao san road.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andy C.,"My new favourite Thai restaurant hands down.
Came here on Friday around 7. The place was packed when we walked in but we immediately loved the vibe. It was a 30-45 minute wait so we left out phone number and they texted us when our table was ready. Make a reservation and save some time.
Service was fantastic. Our waitress was so friendly and gave us tips on our upcoming Thailand vacation. She gave us a ton of attention even when the place was packed.
I filled my Pai hole with Grabong (appetizer) and Pad Gra Prow (main). Both were out of this world. I wish I could eat it everyday. The cocktails were okay in my opinion but they did name their drinks after Toronto Raptors player because the owners are big fans.
Finally the decor made this place. I felt like I was actually in a Restaurant in Thailand. Everything from the washroom to the take out stand was perfect.
Don't go to this restaurant because it'll make it harder for me to get a seat for dinner the next time I go! Avoid at all cost!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Loraine L.,"The food was good but small quantities for the curry that comes in a coconut. The fried swash appetizer was a meal
In itself. The special tea with condensed milk was yummy but heavy. Filling on its own. Also had the pad that which was average.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rosemarie S.,"Best thai in the city! I always get the pad thai, papaya salad and fried fish. Love the casual vibe and welcoming staff.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emma E.,"Great atmosphere, friendly and chill service. The first time I came here I tried the pad gra prow with pork and the chicken wings. The pad gra prow was absolutely delicious. It's so simple, but full of flavour. The chicken wings were pretty good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce. My most recent visit I was going to order the pad gra prow again, but with hesitation decided to try the green curry and I was not disappointed. The curry was creamy and sweet with a touch of spicy (ordered mild). It was perfect since green curry is usually so spicy it makes me sick. My husband ordered the pad Thai and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't my favourite. Would definitely come back and try the other dishes on the menu.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa L.,"We had returned from Thailand in October 2016, and we're feeling a bit nostalgic, so we heard to Pai Toronto for some Northern Thai.  
The restaurant is busy,  and I'm glad we got there early.  The menu seemed authentic.   The Thai Tea was delicious, and spot on.  
We both had the Khao Soi with chicken breast.  My husband found it perfect, but I found it a but too heavy on the curry.   The portions were generous for the price!   
The restaurant could be more comfy - the chairs and tables were cramped and uncomfortably so.  Waiters were friendly and efficient.   Definitely would recommend.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aymen K.,"Does Pai need another 5 star review? No. Yet here I am writing another 5 star review. I would recommend Pai to anyone visiting Toronto because I want them to experience the diversity of food our city has to offer. This is one of the hidden authentic gems. Easy on the pocket, big on flavour and experience. The green curry and pad Thai are done right. Their Thai iced tea is amazinnngg but ask for less ice. If you're not feeling curry or noodles I would recommend the fried basa fish. Its heavier than the other dishes but it's SO good!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jey R.,Very chic place. Kinda cellar vibe. Food is on point. It has a kinda hip hop urban tease to it. It's now on the list of places for TO. .,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sawlat T.,LOVE he coconut flavour of the khao soi. Kinda sad they weren't able to increase the heat on this but still delicious!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ruben C.,"Reservation is recommended.
I reserved a table for a party of 11 on a Friday afternoon. The place was literarily packed even at 3:30 pm. And formed a short line outside of the restaurant when we left around 6:00 pm. 
We basically ordered almost the whole menu and shared. But the tom yum kung (mild) was the highlight of the night. And the khao soi was just made right. We even ordered a tom yum kung to go. Highly recommended.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kay K.,"This was one of the best chicken Pad Thais I have ever had. It was so flavorful and delicious and came almost instantly. Every vegetable and ingredient in the dish was super fresh. I would highly recommend this dish. The service was also extremely quick and everyone was super friendly. I swear that my food came within 5 minutes I could hardly even check my phone before I heard a super friendly cute voice that actually THANKED me for waiting (I literally didnt even think she was talking to me at first), when I had hardly waited even 10 minutes for the food. My only small complaint would be that my water had no ice, and my thai iced tea was filled to the top with very crushed up ice that made it really hard to drink and also made it so that there was only a tiny bit of tea actually in the cup :(. The small amount of tea that i did get was very good though! I would rate the presentation/look/feel of the food a 10/10 but the drink (even the cup was not so pretty) would fall a lot lower on that scale. All of the people that served me and took my order were super friendly and attentive and it was a good experience overall.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,See Jun A.,"One of my favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto! Their cocktails is also surprisingly amazing! Pai Sangria is must try. Also I highly recommend their mango sticky rice (only down side is that sadly, it's not always available.)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Reena B.,"Came here for lunch on a weekday and this place is packed. The wait time for two to eat is only about 10 minutes and well worth it.
Food: SOOO TASTY and unique. Seriously - really flavorful and well presented.  Come hungry!
Service: For a place this busy, it is what it is.  You aren't going to get a beaming waiter - you are going to place your order and hope they get it right.  They did for us and that was the most we could ask for.
Price: Not bad for what you get.
Decor: It is really really cramped in here.  Tables are on top of other tables.  I was hitting my elbow against the next table as I tried to eat my noodles. But its clean enough. With the wait, you're just happy you got a spot to eat.
Noteable extras: None",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Naveen S.,"I love Thai food, but its always been dificult to find places with good quality meals. 
I went to PAI today for lunch after being recommended it by my cooworker. As soon as we entered, we made our way down a few steps into a warm yet lively environment, where they played reggae in the background. The place was clean and acrually looked nice. We got seated quick.
My friends ordered said Pad Thai was delicious. I ordered my usual medium spiced Pad Gra Prao. It was sooo good. Excellent quality, and great amount - didn't over fill me.
I definately recommend this place to everyone!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joe J.,"Amazing, flavorful food.  Get the Betel leaf appetizers.  Very busy, great atmosphere.
Service could be improved but not the food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia H.,"This is by far the best Thai restaurant in town! There's always a line up here so be prepared to wait but the it's worth it! 
I've been here a couple times and my favourite is the tong yum soup . I also like the chicken wings and skewers! All their curries are delicious and the pad Thais are amazing too ! 
Service is prompt and friendly even though it's always busy there.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt C.,"At the time of this review, I had heard that the original owner of Khao Son Road had sold his franchise and started from the ground up with Pai!  As a big fan of the original, I decided to check this place out.
We started with the usual sweet potato Fritters and was surprised to see a very generous serving.  My next bench mark for any thai place, is of course, the Pad Thai.  A very reasonable serving size of Chef Nuit's Pad Thai w/ Chicken set to 'medium' hotness gave it a pleasant kick after taste, which I washed down with, once again, another classic bench mark the Thai Iced Tea.  The Pad thai's distinctive flavour was evident and not overwhelming, and I was happy to taste that the medium spice level didn't take away from it too much.  The Iced Tea was velvety and sweet, but I could've done without half the glass being filled with ice shavings.  
Overall, Pai is ""facelift"" on the old Khao Son Road, but with the same nostalgic taste.  The larger seating capacity and reliable food quality will have me coming back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris A.,"Hands-down best Thai food. We have picked up takeout from here more than a few times and it's always been great. I usually grab a Pad Gra Prow with the crispy pork and the rest of the family typically Pad Thai. Spring rolls and the squash fritters are a must!
Decided we wanted to try eat-in last weekend. Arrived at about 4pm and were seated immediately :) 
Started with chicken satay, spring rolls and squash fritters. The fritters are good for takeout, but they are MUST HAVE fresh! So good. 
The wife and I both ordered the Khao Soi and boy oh boy, so good. The flavour of the curry is incredibly deep and rich. So delicious. Braised beef was tender and delicious. 
Overall, one of the more memorable and enjoyable food experiences in the city to date! Highly recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hadil A.,What a perfect place to walk in to after a flight. I was amazed at the space and food. We were quickly seated once we walked in and danced our way to the table as the music was so good. Menu was simple and flavorful. We had the soup from the starters list and it was super flavorful and super spicy. My mom and I loved it. We shared the pad Thai with chicken and it was superb. Will def be back when I'm in town.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Noah M.,"Pretty long wait but at least you can grab drinks and apps by the bar (but it was a bit cramped). 
I ordered the pad Thai and honestly.. it was really good (perhaps the best pad Thai I've had) but something about pad Thai in general feels lacklustre. I wish I had ordered a curry instead.
I also tried the Grabong as an appetizer. I was hoping for more squash flavour but it mostly just tasted like the fried batter coating (which was tasty...).",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lorraine L.,"Line up seemed long but it actually moved quickly. They don't take day of reservations but if you call in advance, they will accommodate. 
Staff were friendly and the ambience was energetic. The food came really quickly and were all really yummy. The only downfall of the night was that they misplaced our order of chicken skewer which and the order of spring rolls weren't crispy.
Overall, I would recommend PAI as it is one of the better Thai restaurants in Toronto in my opinion.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Evelyn T.,"Great dinner before watching Book of Mormon.  Good ambience, fantastic food and friendly staff. Love thai food and this place offers the best flavors. Ordered Grabong, red curry chicken and crispy pork which are all exceptionally tasty.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David C.,"Had pad thai for take out. Heat would depend on your proximity and overall timing but other than the temperature of the dish, everything is as good as the quality you get in-house. However, there is a large large large discrepancy between the spiciest spice level and the second spiciest. One might deem the second spiciest level to be mild, I really want to warn anyone who dares to consume it as I couldn't even finish the spiciest level!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edward C.,"Came for famous pad Thai at $16.
Sauce was a bit too sweet but portions generous. Packed even in mid-afternoon 
Tom Kang soup packed with veggies and shrimps",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aht S.,"It was my first time visiting this restaurant and definitely not my last. The ambience is ""hippie"", they play good choices of music and the staffs are friendly too. Anyway, I ordered Khao Soi which is a Thai Coconut Curry Noodle Soup with Chicken Breast (or you can have a choice of Braised Beef or Chicken Drumstick). Honestly, the aroma of the soup makes you want to dig in right away and the soup base is flavourful. On the other hand, my friend recommended the Thai Iced Tea so I gave it a shot and its taste is legit 10/10",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vanessa L.,"Great food, great service, great ambiance.
I've been to Pai two times and both times I was delighted with my order! The first time I went was on a girls night out with coworkers and I ordered a Caesar to drink and the oxtail (I can't quite remember the name of it). It was basically a ceramic bowl with an oxtail stew. It came with a side of jasmine rice. I was very satisfied with this order. My meal had a lot of strong flavours and the need was braised well, the meat fell off the bones. And the rice was cooked to perfection. 
The second time around I went I had the same experience in terms of customer service. I ordered the beed noodle soup this time. A must try. If you like noodles and beef, this is your dish! It was basically a bowl of pho, but a very elevated version that had different levels of flavour. It was very filling as well. Near the end of the bowl I was eating for gluttony as I couldn't stop but slurp up that soupy goodness! I generally don't drink the soup but this soup base was excellent. A lot for meat and a lot of noodles. 
The prices here are also very reasonable and its a great place to just hang out with friends after work. But go early before 630 because that's she. It gets packed. And the added bonus here is that you can make reservations. A lot of the more popular Thai places downtown don't allow you to do so. 
I will most likely return :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Deidre G.,"The food and atmosphere at Pai is awesome! The beef in the green curry is so tender and delicious and the sauce is so yummy that it was so hard to stop eating. Also, it comes served in a coconut! 
The pad Thai is one of my favorites! The sauce is the perfect balance of sweet, savory and spicy. The cabbage on the side gives it a nice consistency and is a welcome change from the regularly added bean sprouts. 
Make sure you read the spice level guide on the menu before ordering.  The spicy is very, very, very spicy!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,S M.,"Terrible service at take-out. The guy handing off the food tonight needs to correct his attitude. I regret tipping.
Food was not up to the hype.
Disappointment,  overall.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Annamarie M.,"Good food, but definitely of the hipster variety-- this place definitely doesn't feel nor does it taste (what I imagine to be) authentic.  
Ordered the pad thai noodles per their spicy scale... believe I got *local* spicy which is supposed to be the hottest level they have.  Not really that spicy, and tasted a bit different than other pad thai I've had before. More savory, less sweet.
The pork skewers were good, tastes wood fired almost.  The fried rice was good too, though nothing to write home about.
Service is a bit on the slow side, but friendly none the less.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Harmeet M.,"Great place for lunch or dinner 
Never disliked anything on the menu! 
I'd recommend trying any of these items 
1) starter tom yum soup with shrimp 
2) chef unit pad Thai 
3) green curry
4) pad gra pow (chicken)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matthew L.,I finally found some time to come to this restaurant and found the food absolutely fantastic and the pricing was definitely affordable I would definitely recommend it. Great ambiance too,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy S.,"Came on a Sunday night around 7pm and people were lined up out the door! Fortunately it didn't take too long to finally be seated for a table of 2 - only about 25 minutes. I was surprised how big it was actually because there's a whole other section you don't even see! Service was very prompt throughout the night, with our orders being taken, to the food coming out, and even having our waters filled throughout the night. I would have given Pai 5 stars if not for one of the dishes we got. The one that was a disappointment was the Green curry (in the coconut). It was extremely salty tasting and the portion is very small. Even though they gave us a side bowl of curry it was really just curry sauce... I think we got maybe 5 pieces of beef total for the order and I'm not talking big pieces either, they were relatively small portions of protein. The curry also was too runny, overall didn't enjoy that dish. However we really enjoyed the Chef Nuit Pad Thai (with chicken) and the squash fritters! Both were delicious. For the pad Thai we got the level just below Thai spicy and it was perfect. The portion was good and I enjoyed the chopped cabbage that came with it to mix. The squash fritters appetizer was huge! Definitely a good sharing dish between 3-4 people. It was a lot for just my hubby and I but we enjoyed every bite of it lol I'd definitely come back to try some of the other dishes!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aj T.,"We came for a birthday party and the line-up was 45 minutes, we have been here before. I ordered Grabong, the size was great and the sauce was amazing with the app. . Two of my clients that I brought along ordered Pad Gra Prow with Beef. They have been there before and said the taste was off. We advised the staff and not mention effort was taken to fix it. 
I think it will be tough to keep up with the mass demand.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Margarita M.,Delicious food at great prices and the servers are pleasant and patient and knowledgeable. The drinks are spot on and the service was quick.  Great atmosphere although a little loud to have a conversation,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ali S.,"I came here with a group of friends and we split some chicken satay and battered shrimp.
Great atmosphere, apps were very tasty. Loved the peanut sauce with the satay, and there was a nice sauce with cucumber and chillies with it that was also very tasty. The shrimp was perfectly battered and crispy... Really tasty, and I'm not usually a fan of ordering shrimp unless it's part of dim sum. :) 
I will definitely have to come back here for a proper meal, so this review is just a placeholder for now.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carlos T.,"The place was interesting and really enjoyable, the waiters are very nice and súper cool.
The thing that I didn't enjoy was the food nor the bevrages. However, the concept of the restaurant is cool and everything in the menu is pretty unique, but maybe it just wasn't for me.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anne W.,Stumbled upon this restaurant as it was near our Airbnb and it was FANTASTIC. Best Thai food we've had. Fun drinks and atmosphere! Incredible food! Impeccable service! Many people waiting for tables when we got there at 5pm so get there early!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ann N.,"We ordered the Khao Soi with braised beef - the presentation itself was really cool. The braised beef is really soft and tender and the curry is really flavorful. It's a bit spicy and they can make it spicier but not totally without a bit of kick.
We also ordered the Pad Thai which can be ordered as not spicy at all - also very flavorful and tasty.
Gaeng Kiaw Wan (green curry) was spicy but very good. If you're into spicy dishes then their curry dishes is for you. 
Grabong (battered squash) was crispy with a hint of sweetness to it and the sauce really complements well with it.
Their dishes are about $15 on average which is not cheap but also not too expensive.
We went as a group of 5 adults and 1 toddler. They do have a high chair to accommodate my niece. It was not really good for mingling as it's loud at the restaurant. You have to shout to get heard. 
Also, the service can be very slow. Not sure if it's because we are a bigger group though. 
They also have a really presentable washroom. A bit tight but clean. 
Overall, I was very satisfied with the dishes but the service could have been better.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dave G.,"Best take away Thai that I've had since Thailand. The only ""negative"" is that I expect it to be more spicy when ordering Thai spicy. Beside that everything is fresh and delicious.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hailey P.,Hands down one of my favorite spots in Toronto! Staff are super friendly and the venue is super cute. The food is on another level of amazingness. Seriously one of the best Thai places in the city :),5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ruvim G.,"Fantastic Thai iced tea, and some fairly tasty entrees. I went twice, but sadly the second time was not as good. The fried rice entree is dry and massive, but the curries are flavorful and worth getting. 
The interior is huge, crowded, and noisy, and the servers both times seemed to be in a rush (can't blame them, but perhaps they could use an extra colleague or two). Service is fairly inattentive, as a result. 
I like the internal waiting area, where they serve you snacks and drinks as you wait for a table to open.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thomas C.,"Pai (@PaiToronto) is a fantastic Northern Thai restaurant in Toronto that serves authentic cuisine with sophisticated flavours. Without reservations, you can wait up to an hour on weekends for a table, but it's worth it.  Some opt to sit at the bar when seating is scarce in the main dining area, but others request to sit on the floor without shoes in a traditional setting and larger parties can book private dining.  But, my favourite spot is a nook that offshoots from the main area where vintage vinyl album covers from the likes of Al Greene, Clapton, Queen, and Bob Marley decorate exposed brick walls.
My drink of choice has always been a Thai iced tea at Pai.  It consists of a robust tasting tea mixed with plenty of ice and condensed milk, a great combination to tackle the Phet Mak Mak (thai spicy) spiciness level that you can foolishly choose for your appetizers and mains.  
I typically order a main as an appetizer since they are priced similarly, but my last visit, I ordered the plah nua  (beef salad).  It featured tender grilled beef cooked to medium with shredded cabbage and a tangy lime fish sauce.  Delicious! 
You won't find an inferior ketchup-based pad thai here (think Springrolls).  Instead, you get these bouncy rice noodles mixed with a flavourful tamarind-based sauce.  In addition to your choice of chicken, beef, pork or tofu and veggies, all the usual suspects are present:  crunchy bean sprouts, egg, tofu, aromatic chives, fragrant coriander, roasted peanuts, shredded cabbage and slices of fresh lime.  All of the ingredients mingle together to create depth and layers of complexity.  I love how the dish excels by balancing savoury and acidic elements while not having to rely heavily on sweetness to satisfy ""foreigners.""
The pad gra prow is deceptively simple.  It's just stir fried ground meat (chicken, beef or pork) on top of rice right?  Wrong.  First, it is essential to add the crispy pork belly, which is a delightful accompaniment to the ground meat .  It's so sinfully crispy that it must be fried twice.  But don't worry, the cucumber is there to cut some of the fat.  The fried egg usually has a runny yolk, which is used to combine all the ingredients into a cohesive whole along with the oyster sauce.  The chilies on the plate and in the tangy nam plik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, lime) give the dish a nice kick! 
The khao soi here (with a choice of braised beef, chicken breast or chicken drumsticks) is one of my favourites in the city!  The deep fried crispy noodles always tower into the sky and the tender egg noodles absorb all the exquisite flavour of the golden curry below.  The curry is rich and creamy but not heavy enough to prevent me from consuming it with rice after I am done all the noodles... Why waste good curry?  My only complaint is that I don't always receive mustard vegetables with my khao soi, which is essential in creating the ultimate experience.  
Rice is an excellent canvas to capture all the bold and full-bodied flavours of all of Pai's curries but also their soups!  The gaeng masaman tamarind curry is a terrific comfort food dish for its tender braised beef, starchy potatoes, and crispy shallots.  The gaeng kiaw wan green curry served in a coconut is ordered more for its novelty than taste but you get superb taste from the kaffir lime and basil leaves.  The gaeng hunglay is a sweet and sour ginger curry served with either pork belly or oxtail.  The fall-off-the-bone oxtail was unbelievably tender!
In all, with aromatic Thai herbs and spices at their arsenal, Pai successfully finds the harmonious balance between sweetness, saltiness, and acidity in their dishes.  It's a must-go restaurant in Toronto!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tiff L.,"This may be the most authentic Thai food I've ever had, and Pai has perfected the experience by creating the cozy ambience that brings you back to Thailand. 
First off, I am so glad they take reservations unlike Khao San Road and the service here is much more friendly - every visit has never disappointed me. The seating area is much roomier and you don't need to yell into each other's ears to hear one another. 
My favorite dish here is the Pad Gra Proa with crispy pork. I have to stop myself from ordering this everytime because there's way too many items to try! The Khao Soi is served in a stone pot - you don't even need to taste it to know it's delicious. Just inhale the creamy goodness!
The squash fritters are a must-order appetizer. They're broken into sizable clusters so you don't need to pull at it awkwardly when sharing with a group. 
The only improvement I would suggest is their alcoholic beverages. The cocktails here have witty names but taste very watery. I'm not a drinker but my friends weren't too satisfied with their drinks. The Thai ice tea on the other hand is delicious, another must-try.
I'm in love with Chef Nuit's dishes and will forever be a regular here as long as she's working her magic in the kitchen!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,L K.,"Good authentic Thai spot with amazing energy - classic dishes are great and won't disappoint your craving. 
It can be a bit crowded and noisy - staff is hit or miss on service as it gets busy.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mitch R.,A true lover of Thai food this restaurant blew me out of the water I've been hearing about it for many months and years and finally had the opportunity to go to it and I was not disappointed food was delicious service was great and atmosphere was exactly what was needed for a cold December night,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sharon L.,"Pai Toronto is comparable to Khao San Road, if not better because of the overall experience.
Food: ordered the green curry chicken in the coconut: it had a nice spicy kick and the curry was full of flavour
Atmosphere: much better than Khao San Road as there was an abundant amount of tables and a full serving bar; it had a very casual modernistic feel
Service: the restaurant was busy on a Friday night but the servers were friendly and efficient
I definitely will come back here again and try their famous pad thai. Make reservations in advance if you plan on coming here for dinner.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arcadian B.,"It's another one of these thai places that serve khao soi, heard one of the chefs from khao san road opened this place which is literally like a couple a blocks away from it....pretty neat atmosphere, it's in the basement, loud and dark 
Prices are pretty similar like $14-$15 for the pad Thai and khao soi
Do not order the pork pad Thai unless you like ur meat to be overcooked and rough...I was being adventurous since I always order chicken or beef so I thought I try pork....other than the pork the noodles were good, similar to the other places....girlfriend ordered the beef brisket khao soi that was good, similar to other places but just that they place it in a clay pot bowl, good portions....beer is kind of pricy here so I tried to hold off, the spring rolls were nothing special, it's basically a veggie spring roll that you can get at any chinese place
Service was good Altho they kicked us out cuz we were there for 3hrs
They could have used some better chairs, found them to be quite uncomfortable, wouldn't mind coming back to enjoy the atmosphere and food",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ziqiu Z.,"Great ambiance. Friendly staff who would ask if everything is fine. 
Loved the Thai iced tea! Even tho there is lots of ice, the taste doesn't get diluted.
Green curry with chicken is not contained in a coconut shell for lunch cuz its cheaper. 
I would return to find the Wow factor
update:get-together wiz friends, perfect dinner! love northern Thai sausage. Must try thai iced tea.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shayne M.,"The music was loud, Had a hard time hearing my girlfriend.
Normally I hate environments like this, surprisingly I had a good time under the circumstances.
Expensive, but great presentation.
It's worth it for a nice outing.
I like booths to sit at for privacy, the seating here was super close and tables small, again not my taste, but again had a good time.
The food tasted really good, very good.
Service was great, I highly recommend this place for a nice outing, price is high 80 for me and girlfriend to eat and drink and desert after tip.
More of a younger upbeat crowd.
Ohh and I loved the music they played, I think that's why I didn't mind the loud music, it was my kind of music, I was bobbing around for a few songs.
Do try this place, Great thai food, great service.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karen K.,"Amazing!!! Sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait long. Loved the coconut sake and the recommendation from our waitress. So yum! If I'm Toronto, eat here!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hernan A.,"Second time here in equal number of visits to Toronto. Again, PAI goes not disappoint, even now, even now that I became vegetarian, they made a Pad Thai vegan for me and it's delish. Coupled with good rock music playing, this place is a must for Thai food lovers.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Albert S.,"Seriously one of the best (and more authentic) pad thais I've ever had...
There seems to be a wait for dinner almost every time I've been here (20-30 min.), but the staff is efficient and definitely makes an effort to make sure that you can get a spot once. There's a small waiting ""bench"" and bar inside, but you can also leave your number and they can give you a call or text.
I had the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with both chicken and shrimp at the ""medium"" spice with a Singha beer. They actually have 5 levels of spice (ranging from none to ""thai spicy"" - the one before that being ""foreigner spicy""), and if you haven't had authentic thai food before, this stuff is super spicy. I don't handle heat that well, but medium gave it enough of a kick without giving me too much trouble downing it with the beer.
For dessert, we had mango sticky rice. Pretty simple, no-frills and well done.
I will definitely be coming back here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joanna L.,"This place was amazing! I was in Thailand in November and the flavours of the food here brought me back. I went on a Thursday night at 8:30 and it was packed with people. The wait for a table was 1 hour! But hearing so much about this place I was willing to stick around. Next time, I definitely need to look into making a reservation.
The food: 
Thai iced tea was nice big cup and just the right sweetness. We ordered a papaya salad which the flavors were spot on but only wish was there was more salad and less of the fried pork skin and noodles around it. Next was the Sai ua (northern thai sausage). Not as spicy as Thailand which is great but flavours were the same. Came with a side of veggies and sticky rice. Usually called nim prik where you take pieces of the veggies and eat it with the chilli dip. This dish was good but I think for the 8 slices of sausage it was a little $$. Lastly, we got khao soi and it was good. The curry soup was nice and creamy, the egg noodles were perfectly cooked and the crunchy noodles on top completed the perfect combo.
The service:
I had no issues with the service. Our server was very nice and gave us recommendations. We didn't have to wait too long for our food. And they came back often enough to check on us.
I am definitely going back to try the rest of the menu.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mortaric M.,"The food here was a little pricy but good. We ate family style, ordering multiple dishes and everyone shared. This is a good option to try a variety of flavours without getting tired of one plate of food. 
We stared with a Northern Thai Sausage, a very nice pork sausage appetizer with lemongrass overtones, sticky rice and what I think was cabbage leaves.  After we shared two mains. Gaeng Masaman, a mild spicy tender braised beef curry stew with potatoes in a rich savoury peanut broth along with a side of rice. It was just the right amount of peanut flavour for my liking. This was paired with Pad Cha Hett, a vegetarian dish of oyster king mushrooms, snow peas and purple jasmine rice.  So we got our meat and vegetables. The portion size is generous and this was enough for three people to share the one appetizer and two mains. 
The fruit drinks were Rubicon brand juice, they add too much ice. I recommend asking specifically for only a little ice, or none at all. 
The restaurant is packed on a Saturday night so try to make reservations. We had no reservation, but our wait was still reasonable at about 20+ minutes to be seated. The bathrooms were clean.  The wait staff were nice, fast and attentive.
I would eat here again, and maybe try the Panang Beef Curry next time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kimiko P.,"Yummy food! Loud and lively atmosphere (maybe even too loud). Very quick, friendly service. Altogether an awesome place to stop and grab a bite to eat!
I ordered the green curry and loved that it came inside a coconut! Scraping off the coconut flesh that was soaked in curry sauce was so, so, so good. I think the coconut cooled down the curry though because it wasn't too hot when I got it. The flavour definitely made up for the lack of temperature heat - it was the perfect amount of spice. There was lots of meat and veggies inside of the curry and it was a decent portion. I left feeling full, but not too stuffed.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin W.,"One of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto. Great service, fast, and food is so tasty!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maria L.,"One of my go to spots for Thai food downtown. Great atmosphere and staff and always love their customized drinks named after some of the Raptor's players. 
The grabong or squash fritters are addictive and come in a large serving perfect to share. The gaeng masaman curry was a nice subtle flavour with tender braised beef. 
The pad Thai here is what I keep coming back for. Perfectly cooked rice noodles cooked in tamarind sauce, not ketchup!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,AJ K.,"Funky, cool, and delicious! We loved our visit to Pai and wish we could come back to try everything. We stick with the classics - Pad Thai and Tom Yum Soup - which were both flush with flavor and fresh ingredients. Since we were attempting to walk in, we had to make multiple attempted until finally grabbing a seat (with no wait) at 5p on a Sunday.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amirtha U.,Definitely a fan of this place! The atmosphere is just amazing. The service can be a little slow at times but its definitely somewhere you need to check out. I had the thai iced tea and the chicken pad thai and both were absolutely delicious. The spice level is definitely quite high here so beware!!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen G.,"Not sure what more I could add about the food (which is awesome), but I noticed one interesting fact while I ate here Saturday night. Every employee seemed to enjoy working at Pai Northern, and they're all very courteous.  That tells me a lot about the integrity of the establishment.  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mailin C.,"Best Thai food we had in years!! So delicious, so many flavors! Brings back memories for our Thailand trip a few years ago :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura L.,"I LOVE THE FOOD HERE. I would give this place a 5-star if the wait wasn't so long.
Menu here: 
http://www.paitoronto.com/menu/
What we had: pad thai, khao soi, pad gra prow, green curry (this was over multiple visits, we don't eat THAT much)
Taste: 10/10
I love the pad thai here. It's so flavourful, it's salty, sour, sweet, and spicy and their use of chives really complements everything. I usually get it with beef or shrimp. It tastes different with chicken, I tried it once with chicken and prefer beef or shrimp.
I found the khao soi kind of gimmicky. It was very heavy, the beef wasn't particularly tender, was kind of overcooked. The crunchy noodles were interesting but at the end of the day it's just fried noodles with boiled noodles and overcooked beef in a heavy peanut soup. I would not get this again.
The pad gra prow here is super tasty. This is my favourite dish from Pai right now. I tried it with pork, chicken, and beef. It tastes best with chicken; it really brings out the flavour of the sauce. Depending on the type of meat you get, this dish could taste vastly different. It's topped with a sunny side up egg, which multiplies the yum factor by 1203980954798. I usually don't like eating rice but I have trouble holding back from practically inhaling this dish.
The green curry is fragrant, and it's not overwhelmed with coconut milk. The flavours of the spices really shine. If you get this for dinner, it comes inside a coconut which is cute. Would highly recommend if you like curry dishes.
Value: 5/10
Steven usually can't get full from a main dish here. It wouldn't hurt if they increased their portions... most of their ingredients are inexpensive, like rice and noodles... 
** Average cost per diner: $20 after tax and tip (just mains, nothing else)
Service/Convenience: 2/10
Eating here is super inconvenient and you have to have the patience of a saint. First there's a line... to get a spot in line in their system. Then when you're on the official line, you wait until they call/text you to get a seat. Once you are seated and you place your order, it takes a long time for your order to arrive. We've timed it once. Our food took 40 minutes to come. I strongly recommend just getting take out...
Also, you cannot make reservations on the same day so if you want to reserve, do it well in advance!
Would go back? Maybe when the line-up is not so long once in a blue moon.
Would recommend to friend? Yes but would recommend they get take out.
Similar places: SukhoThai but then again they're by the same owners
**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Havi R.,"My girls and I visited Toronto during Christmas/NYE week a few months ago and we decided to check out Pai while we were in town. Now, I'm a die-hard Thai fanatic - it's my favorite cuisine ever! Imagine how extremely disappointed I was after my unpleasant experience at this establishment. 
For starters, the food wasn't extraordinary - it's exactly what I expected. 
Our dining experience was horrible! We were seated around 2pm-ish on NYE and were served our drinks and apps in a timely fashion. We had to track down our waiter though to put in our entree orders and to our dismay he never passed it along to the person taking over his shift. We waited for a ridiculously long time to be served our food. If I remember correctly, we were in the restaurant for about two hours and our food had yet to be delivered to our table. 
I was so appalled at the lack of customer service that I spoke to the Manager and explained what happened. They apologized profusely and offered complimentary apps and 50% off of the check. I appreciate the effort that they took in trying to resolve the issue and our disappointment; however, it wasn't until later on that I realized we didn't truly get 50% off the check. Of course, the restaurant calculated it to their advantage. I still left a tip because I'm the type of customer who doesn't let one bad experience dictate future ones.
I do want to advise other customers to have minimum expectations when dining here and speak up if you're not happy with the level of service.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jess W.,"One of my favourite Thai restaurants in downtown. Been here multiple times and every dish I've tried was delicious. Their various spice levels are great! I can usually eat very spicy foods and their highest spice level (PHET MAK MAK) is quite authentic to how spicy the dish would be if a local in Thailand asked for their food to be spicy. 
The only thing is, there is always a line up here even right away when the restaurant opens. Best to make reservations in advance to avoid long waits.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Josephine P.,"Having tried this restaurant a long time ago, I have been thinking about this ever since I booked my weekend bus tickets for Toronto. 
This place is a must go, the vibes are amazing. I can't stress enough how amazing the food is (that explains the insane line up). The staff is helpful and gives good suggestions. 
They don't have many vegetarian options, but the vegan Pad Thai is amazing. 
We went last weekend and ordered the same dishes we love so very much (Pad Thai and the Pad Gra Prow). This Thai restaurant is so wonderful that I want to be best friend with the chef and learn how to make the dishes. 
This place is quite packed in the evenings so I would suggest going for lunch. I haven't had that delicious Thai food in Montreal (if anyone knows- please tell me) but the food here is flavourful, fresh and I believe quite authentic. 
Best Thai food I have had so far, hands down. Highly recommend this place to everyone who is in Toronto or visiting.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sheena O.,"EDIT: This is actually meant for the other restaurant down the road. Khao San Road is the name, I believe.
I was visiting from out of town and really had a craving for Drunken Noodles. Though there were many Thai places around the area, this restaurant seemed to be the most inventive and had great reviews. It was during Caribana and it was also a holiday weekend so the line was to be expected but seeing as I was ordering my food to go, I was hoping that the wait would not be as long. 
The wait took a long time and there was no place to sit and wait. Literally had to go to the sub store next door to wait. The hostess was also very rude to people as they waited to be served. She almost got into a heated argument with a patron as well which is why I'm giving them 4 stars.
Otherwise, the food is AMAZING and I love how you can be very specific about the spice level. I ordered drunken noodles with chicken and a pad Graw po (sp)which had chicken and the egg on top. Sooooooo good and soooooo flavorful. Would definitely order both again but I would call ahead first. They also take cards with chips which is great for International travelers. 
Overall - best thai food I have ever had!!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Heather P.,"Came all the way from Detroit to try this place. Must say it was worth the travel! Excellent food and service. Ambiance is pretty rustic / casual and flavors are authentically delicious! Diverse set of people walking in and out of the establishment. 
Of the many dishes / drinks that I ordered these three stood out: 
- Thai iced tea (had me deceased) 
- Chef Nuit Pad Thai 
- Green Curry 
- any Red Curry dish will also have you deceased 
ALL are must-try's!!! 
Thanks Pai Northern Thai Kitchen for an amazing meal and keeping to those authentic Thai roots!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jassy M.,Very average and overpriced. Didn't think the flavours were that great and found the portions to be small. Similar issues as with khao San road. Love sukhothai so much better!,2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Naureen D.,"Amazing Thai food. Delicious and fresh! A small menu that offers a good variety! We ordered the pad Thai, papaya salad, and beef panang. Service was a bit slow at times but otherwise an enjoyable experience.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Teresa V.,"Make sure you come here at least an hour early before your preferred time because that's how long the wait is. I've been here 3x and each time, we waited for at least an hour, regardless of party size. the food is amazing and so are the drinks!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Seth S.,"Simply phenomenal backpacker-style Northern Thai food. Everything was on point: cool interior (felt like a backpacker hostel, in a fun and good way), service (fast and friendly), food (amazing). I felt like I was back in Thailand and had just found an amazing spot to eat.
Try the green papaya salad, khao soi, and a Thai iced tea. And don't forget mango sticky rice for dessert.
If you want Thai food in Toronto and don't mind paying a bit of money, stop thinking and just go here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina C.,"AMAZING! Great atmosphere and even better food. A friend recommended this place to us and we were SO grateful that he did. The Khao Soi might easily be one of the yummiest things I have ever eaten. My boyfriend ordered the Pad Thai which was also delicious but almost boring in comparison. We will be back to try every single other item on the menu, as long as I can tear myself away from the Khao Soi... I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!
COME EAT HERE! If I could give them 10 stars I would. 
bonus: affordable too and great service!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Essie N.,"friendly relaxed service very chill attitude but you can see that they take their jobs seriously 5/5 service
The food was very declious and yummy. Many items I never thought I'd try but im glad I did. 
Ill definitely be back. I choose medium spicy thinking I could handle it... I could not lol. So for all you softies like me thinking you can handle medium.. I suggest you just stick with mild their spicy meter is higher than the usual place. XD",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Singhfoodie J.,"Good food, loved the cocktails. The ambiance gives a pleasant feeling with dim lights, lake side sitting and music.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brad D.,"love this place! well, its cool, especially the Tom Yum Soup. You must try this and you will taste many absolutely delicious. The quality is very consistent.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Seema S.,"Love this place. The food was delicious on both occasions that we dined here. 
The pad thai had good tangy flavour and chewiness to the noodles.
The green curry came in a hollowed out coconut husk and was the right balance of coconut sweetness and green curry spiciness.
The squash fritter (app) was a huge portion and not what I expected. Lots of crunchy battered strands of squash. I was in crispy-crunchy heaven and the garlic tamarind sauce paired with the sweetness of the squash took me to my happy place.
We actually ordered the same set of dishes on both visits - something that we don't normally do - because they were that yummy! We will be back to try other items from P's menu. We also enjoyed P's sake selection!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Casey D.,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Decor is reminiscent of 70s Vietnam era with records on the walls, pictures of presumably Thai Military men and other hipstery things.
Had the squash fritters as an app which were fantastic, lightly battered and enough for 3. Ordered the Pad Thai for a main which had a reasonable portion size but didn't really seem like anything special. Other Thai places give you something similar for less money as this was $15.50
Last, the service wasn't great. We arrived right around the peak of lunch time and by the time we finished our meals our section had died down and thus we were ignored for 20 minutes while we tried to find our server.
This is definitely one of the nicer Thai places in the city, but you seem to pay for it as it seems roughly 40 percent pricier than other Thai places.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Albert M.,This is probably my favorite place for Thai food. The Khao Soi was so flavourful. The ambience was rustic and warm.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jon C.,"So I've been here twice now, once for takeout and another dining in.
I've had the Grabong, which i think is one of the best things on the menu. Squash Fritters which are amazing. Kinda of a take on fries or rosti, but with squash.
We also ordered the papaya salad which has great flavor, two small circles of noodles which were so sticky and made me wonder why this isn't loose. Cause I'm supposed to dip it into the papaya salad and then it comes apart. There are some shrimp chips on the side which I like but not a fan of the pork grinds. This is larger than you might think. We also added the salted crab which sounds like a good idea but man those are small crab legs, so small I couldn't see it.
The pork skewers with stick rice is nice too. I really like the sticky rice, it goes great with everything.
So here's the thing, I wouldn't say I'm as in-love with the food as I was the first time I went to khao san road. However, the service is pretty good here. We were outside when i started raining and they made an effort to move the tables inside so that we could sit inside and not in the rain. Well-done!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie C.,This place was a fantastic surprise. You aren't sure what to make of the place. It's kind of off the beaten path and it's in a basement as well. But when you get to the end of the stairs you are immediately put at ease seeing that the place is packed. The curry broth was rich and so delicious. Highly recommend this place.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shirley L.,"Came here during a weekday for lunch. There was a bit of a wait but it wasn't very long, maybe around 10-15minutes to get a table for two. When me and my friend sat down, it took a while to get service from our server. Our first server came to ask us for drinks and we requested water but the water never came until we waived the server again.
We placed our orders for spring rolls, kung tawt, tom yum soup, pad thai, and fried fish. The appetizers were great, especially the kung tawt. It wasn't overly battered and I love the sauce that it comes with. These are highly additive! Moreover, the tom yum soup was nice. I thought the spring rolls were okay, I probably wouldn't order this again. 
Onto the entrees. I love the pad thai, it was tasty but I was expecting more given the high reviews. Don't get me wrong, it was great but it did not wow me. The fried fish was good with the curry that it comes with. Again, nothing from the entrees ordered really wowed me. 
Overall, PAI has good thai food. However, the service was really disappointing. I had to go through 3 different servers to request for chili flakes. (Me and my friend asked two servers for chili flakes but they never came with it, until we reached our third server) Our entrees were getting cold as we wait for the chili flakes.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ardalan A.,"Phenomenal! The best Thai food I ever had! 
This place is a must go for everyone (Torontorians or if you are visiting). The food is from heaven!!!
Ordered plum mule for drinks ! Surprised! Exotic is the best work to explain it.
For food appetizer we ordered the Kung Tawt (fried shrimp) which was good. Main dish, Gaeng Klaw was in coconut with chicken and Khao Soi with beef! 
The best food I had for a while I can even say the best food I had in Toronto!
Will definitely come back (looking forward to next time here!).
khao soi with beef is on my list as my last meal!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tasha L.,"The locals were correct on this one! We made a reservation and got right in, 5 min wait tops but there were a lot of walk-ins waiting. Reservation is the way to go. It is definitely a busy place, rather crowded. Although it's huge they have table upon table crammed in the space so much that you  are eating, conversing with your neighbor which can be good or bad. There were only 2 of us, maybe a larger party would have better seating? The food was really good, my only complaint is that my Pad Thai was fairly dry, flavorful, but dry and when I asked for a sauce to add to my meal the waitress said there was nothing to add. I like that you can adjust the heat in most entrees, good portions, heated well the next day. I'd definitely go back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark S.,The food was good. Had oxtails that were cooked great. They were very tasty and would probably order them again. Had saki bombs which were surprisingly good. The saki was good but the beer they paired it with was even better. The prices were normal so it wasn't bad at all;I would definitely come back to this restaurant.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tory I.,"I went on a Sunday evening in October with friends before we saw a movie at the TIFF after dark festival. I was with 2 guys, one came later than we had planned so we waiting for him to order.  I ordered the fried fish (with rice and 2 sauces) and the sweet potato tempura. Both came quickly and were extremely delicious. 
Some things I would improve: 
-the initial service (when ordering drinks) they asked us 6 times in 15 min. 
-when we ordered drinks it took them that same about of time to bring it 
Other than that I liked the atmosphere and the vibe. Would def go back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Miss Explore R.,"I love the braised beef from here I haven't been inside the restaurant but I do order online. It takes a little longer then most places but that is expected for a place with such high quality food standards! I also love that you can order just a side of green curry as a side sauce since I usually like to order a few menu items it gives me the feeling that I still got the whole
Curry meal! Delicious and can't wait to eat within the establishment.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tulin A.,"Very busy and hip Thai place in downtown Toronto. Great quality Thai food, good portions and very cool ambience (dim lighting and live colors)! Totally recommend their Pad Thai. 
You'd definitely need a reservation.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bernie C.,"Heard great things about this place, but slightly disappointed overall.
For a start, the service was great and our waiter was very attentive. Appetisers wise, we ordered the squash fritters, the chicken wings, and a starter bowl of tom yum soup. The chicken wings were amazing, and I especially liked that the tom yum soup was slightly sweet instead of being too sour like it is at most places. The squash fritters were tasty, but the portion was huge - way too much for 2 persons, and more suitable for a party of 4 or 5. 
For mains, we ordered the green curry in a coconut and the basil pork. The green curry was great, but we waited about 30 minutes for it. We also specifically requested it to be served piping hot, but to our disappointment, the curry arrived to our table at room temperature. This was the same for our tom yum soup, which was unfortunate. The basil pork was good, but I have definitely had better. 
Sangria was great - refreshing and tasty. The Thai iced tea was way too sweet, but not too bad. 
Restaurant had a trendy, eccentric hipster vibe, and was overall not a bad dining experience. More towards a 3.5 stars.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daya G.,I like the way they serve the food. Ordered Thai green curry and they served it on coconut shell. Experience n food was great,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy W.,"Luckily, I got here at 11am, as soon as it opens, because it fills up super fast. The ambiance is so cute and the food is just as good (which means it's amazing!!). I had the pad thai which was flavourful and really hit the spot. 
This is hands down my go-to place for Thai in the city. Will be back! :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hannah Y.,"Best Thai food I have ever tasted. Came here several times and it's super busy!
Tip: Come right at the opening hour! This place gets packed in the first 30 minutes!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sababa S.,I had ground pork with jasmine rice served with a fresh citrusy sauce and fried egg on top. This was amazing. The ground pork was juicy and the amount was just about right. The spice level was perfect. I would love to have this dish again.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erika F.,"This place was freaking amazing! From the courtesy of the hostess and servers. This place was one I loved. The art was so awesome, nostalgia for old school music with the albums hanging on the wall to the way the lights dangled overhead. Two dining areas and you are still looking at a 35min wait but trust me it was worth it!! Make your way here!!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paul A.,The food was amazing. The energy and ambiance was incredible. The art and album covers in the walls combined with the story of the origin of the establishment made the place feel more like a welcoming home than an actual restaurant. Which was great.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jack C.,"I visited a few times in the last few weeks and Pai has never failed my expectation! Its truly an authentic Thai food experience and the right price and portion. Best of all they take reservation:). 
My last visit was with my whole family, and I consider them to be tough critics since they don't like to try new things. I was worried what they will say about My choice of resturant. Thankfully they LOVED every dish that came their way, and I was spared. My new favorite dish is the pork strew, it literally melt in your mouth with a explosion of flavor!
I will definitely be coming back here....just hope the line up won't become like Khao San Road and have to wait 2 hours for a table...but I guess its inevitable.
BTW, its better than Khao San Road IMO. And that's says a lot !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Natalle C.,Friendly service. Staff did not rush me to order as I waited for my boyfriend to show up (and he was laaaaaate) even though the restaurant was getting packed. Both drinks ordered cojo and something else were delicious. Also tried the Thai fried rice and beef noodles soup. Very flavourful and generous portions. Would come back another time and try their other items.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leanne W.,"We came here for lunch as this is usually my go to for Thai dishes, the food never seizes to disappoint and service is always quick and friendly. We ordered the classic beef pad thai with the green curry in the coconut. Presentation was splendid, but food was even better! Definitely worth the drive downtown",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mei L.,"Definitely a go-to spot for us.
They are celiac safe and also have vegan options. The food is great and also priced well for what you get. Good quality and taste and service has always been really good.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,The Z.,"Reservation recommended. However, the line for non reservations moved fast and we were seated quickly. Good ambiance. The food however was lacking. Maybe spoilt by the New York food scene. The Tom Yum soup was good and had good flavors. The PAD GRA PROW was disappointing. Overall, decent, but not impressed with all the hype.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grace L.,"I hate to give anything but a five star review to this famed place but I have to say I did not leave wowed or even feeling satisfied. The ambiance is amazing first of all, but it went down from there :(. The food tasted good but it was honestly nothing special. Per the recommendation of the very nice bartender I had the Pad Gra Prow which turned out to just be some minced pork over rice with a fried egg on top. Not a big portion, three slices of cucumber on the side, honestly I felt ripped off. The sauce on the side was actually the best part. It was not worth 16.5$. I was still hungry after that. So I ordered chicken wings which was also a disappointment. They were so tiny and the flavor wasn't wow. I left and got ice cream. I was still not feeling satisfied and went to loblaws and got some sushi. So sad.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris R.,Love this place!!! Fun party like atmosphere and excellent food. I have like everything I have ever ordered. I use Pad Thai as the measuring stick for all Thai restaurants and theirs did not disappoint!!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Neet D.,"My favorite Thai spot despite the long wait. I can always wait in their 40-50 mins queue to taste the deliciousness. We ordered thai style chicken wings which were amazing, wish I had order 2-3 extra pieces. For the mains I ordered Gaeng Masaman curry which was the best I've ever had and my husband ordered Khao Soi which was as good as it can get.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Philip C.,"Everyone comes to Pai for the Green Curry and Khao Soi but tend to neglect the other items on the menu. The Laap Salad was not what I had expected. The salad was more in the form of lettuce wraps than an actual salad. The mixes of spice along with the ground pork, veggies and sticky rice wrapped in lettuce had an explosive amount of flavour to it,  but in a good way.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rawan M.,"I can understand why people are raving about this place, the food is wonderful, fresh, quick and authentic. You can choose your spice level so there is something for everyone. The price is very fair and average for thai food. It gets very busy so reserve or come in early.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,KC A.,"i have been to thailand. i have an asian taste buds and i'm so hard to please esp when i correlate it to the price but this restaurant is the bomb!!!!
not even sorry for the exaggeration on the introduction cause thats how much i loved the food.
we had:
skewers for share
pad thai
kao soi",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex L.,"Visited Toronto for the weekend and stumbled upon here after getting recommendations for friends. The wait was around 30 minutes on a Friday night which wasn't too bad, we were able to kill time at the bar. I got the Khao Soi which was very tasty but the proportion of broth to noodles was off putting to me, wish they gave a little more of both as the portion was really small. The Asian inspired sangria was the best drink I had all weekend though, it had lychee and some other fruits inside with a blend of juices/alcohol that was really refreshing and enjoyable.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Crystal T.,"Its hard to find a really good thai restaurant in Toronto. Pai has really good pad thai, their taste of it is a little different than others, but it's over priced.
Thai ice tea is a must to order!!
I'm not 100%sure but seems like their use of meat for all the main dishes are the same frozen meat from thai express or teriyaki. Not going back for the curry but only the pai thai.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela L.,"Khao Soi was flavorful.  Atmosphere is incredibly crowded, loud and fun.  Our group of 12 was in a room near the bathrooms, which I loved as the main area was much noisier.  I had the mango rice dessert which I do not recommend.  Everything else was well done and reasonably priced.  Extremely long lines so we are glad we made a reservation weeks in advance.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clara Y.,"It's actually been a while since I've gone back to Pai. There were a couple years that I went quite often and would get the same thing almost 99% of the time: Chiang Mai Beef Noodle. It's so flavourful and the beef chunks are so tender. 
I really like their Thai iced tea as well, just as good as the ones in Thailand. 
It's a bit hard to get a table without a long wait, so if you know you want to go, I suggest making a reservation well ahead of time on their website.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica F.,One of the best Thai restaurants I've tried in the city! It's been pretty busy every time I've been though so maybe consider a reservation before going!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bonnie L.,I love Pai! I always go here with my friends when they come from out of town. Delicious tasty food. It does get busy after work though but the place is pretty big. I love the curry and pad thai.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,A.J. S.,"I ate here with some friends who work close by. I really enjoyed eating here. They had good food. I had the Pad Gra Prow. I have only really had this in Toronto. I highly enjoyed eating it here. It had a great balance of spices and flavors. I also love the menu! It was super tasty!!
I kind of felt lke the place used to be like a pub, and was converted in a thai place. I enjoyed the decor, and i like that they had places to hang your coat, You aren't too close or too far from the people that you are eating next to, thus you neither feel crowded nor abandoned. The service is good. I recommend it.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Will T.,"Yum! This place rocks your socks! Excellent Thai food. They recently opened and have a small patio with a downstairs venue. Pro tip: there's a secret group room on the left when you go in. Pretty amazing with their  khao soi curry with egg noodles. However, in comparison to Suko Thai, their portions are a bit smaller in terms of both noodles and chicken. I prefer Suko Thai to this place for this particular dish. But their pork kabobs were heavenly! I could eat a million of them! Come here before it gets ""popular"".",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hetal M.,the BEST Thai food I have ever had! their service was great and the food was delicious! I will definitely be going back again. I had the chicken pad Thai with the peanut sauce (additional charge) and the person I went with had the coconut veggie curry that came in a real fresh coconut!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura K.,Get the beef Khao Soi!! Most Thai places don't have this dish so it was an absolute treat!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tim C.,Best Thai in Toronto!!  Get a beer and spring rolls.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joey B.,"This would be my other recommended thai restaurant other than Khao San Road. Taste great and really can't go wrong with anything. The restaurant is pretty dark and loud, speak up if you want to be heard!
This time I had the ox tail curry while my S.O. got the thai fried rice. The curry is flavorful, though it does kind of remind me of Jamaican ox tail (nothing wrong with that though really). The thai fried rice great as well. Similar to Chinese style fried rice but with the addition of shrimp/crab paste. Squash fritter good as always especially the dip, though I wish it was a bit crispier.
The only odd thing that happened was the entrée came out pretty much right after we started our appetizer. Felt like we had to rush eating before the good gets cold.
Atmosphere - 4/5 
Food - 4.5/5
Service - 3.5/5",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Qian C.,"I've been here 3 times already since the summer. Never disappointed. I would come back to eat in a heartbeat if I'm in the area. 
I ordered the Chiang Mai Beef Noodles,  Gaeng Kiaw Wan  and another curry I forget now. ""Foreigner spicy"" was too spicy for me, but medium is nice. The drinks are decent and the service is pretty good.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve H.,"Good. Mushroom not my thing as I seek out more dense vegan protein. However, this was pretty darn good. I would say closer to a 4 star than three but a bit too much oil. Again, good though. The servers were outstanding and very nice with smiles.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Simon L.,"Loved this place.  Price is decent.  Maybe the portions for some dishes couldve been bigger but the quality is what counts and it was amazing.  The waitress told me they will be opening one in Vancouver.. Which is where I am from. I am going to go to that for sure. 
Love this place...and I'm going to Thailand in a few months so I'll see how it compares.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dil R.,The BEST THAI restaurant in downtown Toronto!!!! Amazing food amazing service only the wait was a bit long but definitely worth it. Favourite dish was the soup and beef Mussaman curry,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paul S.,"Had a late (2pm) lunch here on a snowy day.  The food was excellent, obviously high quality and fresh ingredients that was well prepared.  Service was quick and friendly.
The music was excellent.  Not so far in the background that you couldn't make out what it was, not at all loud though.
The menu is limited - which is more of a benefit than a hinderance in my experience.  
I would love to go back next time I am in Toronto and would advise friends to visit.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tristene B.,"Would miss it if you were walking by but once you're inside and see the line up, you know it'll be worth it. Order pad Thai and it was great. Enough for lunch but for dinner you'll need an appetizer. Each day they have a drink special which is great! Laid back environment. Good if you like good Thai food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Moe S.,"They have near-perfect reviews for a reason. It is one of, if not, the best Thai restaurant in Toronto in terms of food, atmosphere and service.
Expect to wait for 45mins-1 hour if you don't have reservations. You can always chill by the lounge until you get seated.
Great spot for a date or just with friends. Very casual place and the servers are easy going.
Highly recommended!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sondra P.,"They have Khao Soi, which I've only ever seen in northern Thailand, so that excited me. So delicious! They also make a great Thai milk tea. Nice atmosphere. Baby friendly. I took my 7 month old with me. No high chairs but they had a change table in the bathroom.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Janet S.,"Very delicious Thai cuisine. Food price range is reasonable (around 15-20$ per dish). The restaurant had a really cool vibe, I like their menus which were very cute and hand written. 
I personally prefer PAI to khao san road, taste wise. 
The service here is quite slow. It took almost 20 mins to get our bill and maybe 40 mins to get our order... Definitely make a reservation before going or you may wait a while!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Helen J.,Always good. Always get the squash fritter to share. Thai ice tea never disappoints. And any entree will do. We love coming here.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jurenda J.,"The flavours are on point. The closet you are able to get to actually eating in Thailand. They have a wonderful private room with a great family style menu. The portion sizes are amazing and everyone will leave stuffed. I wish I could recommend my favourite items...:but they are all spectacular in their own way.  
It is a perfect location for birthdays, first dates, anniversaries. You name it....this is the place to celebrate it. 
What are you waiting for? Go check it out!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rach N.,"I went in Oct 2014 for an early dinner with a girl friend around 5:15 pm on a Saturday night. She had been raving about this place & this was my first time going. 
We were seated immediately and given a choice between an area tucked away or the main room. We chose the main room. 
We started with their specialty/signature cocktails which were pricey ($11-14) but delicious. 
I deviated from my friends suggestion for my main. I was in an adventurous mood and I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with extra crispy pork on top of the ground pork on a bed of rice with a Thai style egg cooked on top ($16$. I went for Fareng Spicy which had a little bit of a kick but didn't require I drink a lot of water to cool my tongue. Overall, the dish was average. I wouldn't order it again. The portion size was really good however and I was pleasantly full after eating all of it. 
We also ordered the starter of fried squash fritters called Gabong ($10) which my friend also recommended. They were good although I was expecting something different. I also can only handle a little bit of fried food so my friend took the leftovers home to her husband. The tamarind dipping sauce was disappointing and boring. 
The waitress wasn't very friendly even though the dinner rush hadn't started yet. She didn't give us much time to look at the menu to order drinks. 
The ambience was chill and cool. I liked the dim lighting. 
I plan to go back for dinner tonight and stick with something safe like pad Thai which I hear they do well :) it's a good location and I'm hoping the service will be fast again as I'm seeing a play at The Royal Alexandra Theatre @ 730 pm.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina P.,"Great food! Very Authentic Thai food. 
I brought my 3friends here to have an eatly dinner but the service we got last Saturday was a bit unpleasant. We came there, walk in no reservation, as there online reservation was not flexible, the only time available was 3pm which we can't make it so we did the walk in. It was quick and  got seated right away. However, the they put us on a very corner. So we asked if we can be moved as we can see that there's more space available and the girl whose serving us said that she can't because if there's 2 people coming they can seat them there, while 4 of us all cramped up on the corner. Then we saw an Ice coffee like drink so we asked if they have If we can have an Ice coffee  and she said ""no we don't serve that it's not in our menu"" not polite. So we pointed out the drink and she said ""Oh it's a milk iced tea"" then my friend asked, which is on the menu ""ok I'll just have the coconut water, please."" And the server said ""oh! We ran out of it"" so ok fine we went with our orders then after few minutes we saw 4 people coming seating on the table that we asked to be moved. Just right beside our table! Right enough to be right on our face! It was a very bad service I must say, I understand if it was really busy with really no spot available but there is a spot, we wouldn't have asked if its not possible. And for that I give 2 star. I would give 4 but but the customer service was foul. Service is important to me. customer's last impression to a restaurant and how restaurants make their customers feel after leaving their place is important. Aside from the taste of food a good customer service would also do the magic. Would i eat here again? maybe because the food is great, but I will second thought of bringing my family or friends just because of the bad service, and by the way this is my 2nd time eating here and service is almost the same but even worst this time.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Timothy D.,"Excellent!  The wait was not as bad as it looked food was wonderful (Tom yum soup) mmmmm! 
Go there!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hema F.,Get the khao soi!!! No questions asked. Best khao soi in town. Slightly more expensive compared to other Thai restaurants though.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kiranjit B.,Liked this spot. The decor is pretty cool. I wanted to take pictures of it but felt kind of weird because there were so many people crammed in the tables around us. But not SO tight that we felt like someone was sitting at our table. I had a thai dish from the menu. It was pretty tasty but just thought there were too many vegetables and they were cut way too big (but that's my personal opinion). Oh and I also substituted their chicken for tofu and the tofu was just right!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Milad R.,Simply the best Thai food I've ever had in Toronto!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia L.,"We were at the Destination Thailand Festival and checked out the food booths. What made Pai stand out was the story board of how the restaurant came to be. We decided to not buy at the stand but check out the restaurant because it was freezing. Also because someone commented that Pai was the best Thai resto  of the 5 booths lined up there. Walked to the resto and didn't expect such a big place. The interior was so fun with the exposed brick and vintage record albums. Not what I would expect a thai resto would look like.
Service was great and asked for recommendations beyond pad thai - tried this shrimp appetizer - very fresh with great flavors! Check it out :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer N.,"I have been here twice now and I love it! The food is amazing with the spices and other flavours just perfectly complimenting each other. There is always a line up, so get in early or ever better book! For a table for 4 on a Friday night, we had to wait for a hour but we just went to another bar for drinks until they sms'd us that the table is ready. 
The curries are a must try - chicken breast curry with noodles - get on it! Paired with a lychee drink, just ends a hot night into a pleasant and relaxing night out.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie Y.,"Super tasty, has definitely taken over my past favourites of Khao San Road or Sabai Sabai. Suhko Thai is the only other restaurant that compares in taste. 
It's super busy all the time, but the food is definitely worth it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jen A.,"Went here Sep 2020 for dinner. Food was good, service was alright, nothing to complain about. Not the best Thai food in Toronto (in my opinion) but a solid choice",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wing P.,Came here based on the great reviews when I was visiting Toronto. There was a long line to get in (30 mins line to put your name down and another 30 mins to wait for a table after). This place has great vibes. Never thought of mixing Thai food with Jamaican music. The food was great but it was a bit too spicy (we asked for mild).,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Beatrice N.,"Meh. I've been twice and both times the line was long, service was average, and food was ok. 
I love Thai food, and I feel this place doesn't deserve the hype; it's decent, but given how expensive and time consuming it is (for Thai) I really don't understand the rave reviews. Both meals I had were simultaneously too salty and kind of tasteless. It's fine, but there are much better and cheaper Thai places in the city.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Holly M.,"I lucked into this gem unplanned and was so glad glad I did--trust the hype! I arrived at 5:30 on a Tuesday, which was, apparently, just the right time because there was maybe a 70 person wait when I was leaving, and I was sat at the bar and served right away. I ordered the Laab, Green Curry, and Mango sticky rice and it was easily the best Thai meal I have every eaten with enough left over for another entire meal. Do yourself a favor and stop in. It's worth whatever the wait is.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,H L.,This place fills up so quickly so better go when it's open. The dishes are delicious but I found the size on the small side. The menu has limited selections. It's more of a pub feel rather than a traditional Thai restaurant.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kiran S.,"We got here around 5:30 on a Friday and there was a lineup to get a table but we ended up getting seated after 15 minutes. The atmosphere inside was very inviting and and busy. Since there were so many people and pretty loud it was hard to speak over the crowd. We started off with the spring rolls followed by the shrimp pad Thai, Khao Pad Thamada with chicken (rice, egg and chicken) and Khao Pla Tawt (Basa fillet in red sauce). Everything tasted fresh and not something that was a day old. The flavours were rich and delicious. Enjoyed all the dishes. I would definitely come back to try other menu items. As we were leaving there were still lineups to get in! Can't wait to come back!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anthony H.,"Very delicious food. Highly advised to book a table in advanced. Although we did not and the mines were long, the wait itself after being placed on the wait list for 2, was quite short. The curry here is just amazing and I love the coconut taste in it. Must try :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex L.,"Amazing Thaifood. I have been here multiple times! Line ups can vary. From an hour to 15 minutes at its best. The Pad Thai is to die for! Honestly, anything on the menu is amazing.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Malik C.,"The long wait was worth it. The food was fantastic. Make sure to get there a little earlier than you planned if you do not have a reservation as this place gets packed. If you're stuck waiting for a table, no worries! Simply walk over to their bar and they will get you handled with a tasty drink. Food was great and if you are spice fanatic make sure to let them know!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ruth H.,"My favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto... probably one of my favourite restaurants period. Pai was recommended to me a hundred times before I visited myself and found that it lived up to the hype. It's tucked away in a trendy little basement and is usually pretty busy, but the servers are all very friendly and welcoming - it doesn't have that snooty vibe some of the busier, more popular restaurants have. Most importantly, the food is amazing. I love that you can choose the spiciness level that you prefer. I need to come back to try everything on the menu.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aya E.,"I am giving this restaurant 3 starts due to wait time. As my family and I arrived to the restaurant, we were quickly seated - to which I was surprised as it was a Friday night. After ordering our food, we waited 40 minutes for our food to come out, while we saw people who were seated after us and received their food before us. 
The food was good. But I'm not sure if I was biased because I was hungry or if it was actually good...",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kyle C.,This place is really cool. I came in for lunch and sat at the bar. The service was quick and so was the food. I order the chicken pad thai and a beer. The pad thai was very good with the right amount of heat. My only complaint is that I felt like the portion sizes were small. Maybe it was a lunch portion and I didnt realize it or maybe I have a skewed opinion on pad thai portion sizes but it just felt small. Good either way though.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kathy N.,Food was spot on. Always great. Been here many times but service was by far the worst. Gave a 90 minute seating meeting limit but was forgotten for 30. Didn't bother bringing us the water we asked for and dessert which was then cancelled. Had the audacity to ask how the service was after.,2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,K C.,My first dinner of our Toronto Downtown Trip!! Love the Ambience!! And all the dishes is equally great!! The best pad-thai I had in North America!! The only downside is the waiting time! Go early!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sofya P.,"This is mine and my friends' go to place for Thai. The flavours are always great and as mentioned by our Thai friend, quite authentic. I've tried over 5 dishes there and I can say everything has been great. My favorite is pad thai but other dishes like tom yum, khao soi, pad gra prow, mango sticky rice, thai ice tea have been really good as well. I always go for 'thai spicy' level as I like spicy food I'd say it's around salad king's level 10 maybe a bit below. The place is super busy though so if you come during dinner time there's usually a wait. They expanded the back so there's more space but fyi they don't have a liquor licence there yet.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bo J.,I like Thai food but it's not my favorite. Paid Thai is easily the best I've ever had and the Pad Gra Prow with shrimp made me a believer and crave my next visit.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carrie F.,"Pai is my absolute favourite spot in Toronto for amazing Thai food. For a first timer, you cannot go wrong with the green curry, red curry, pad thai, or pad see ew. For dessert, I recommend the mango sticky rice. Their atmosphere, while a bit dimly lit and loud at times, is incredibly lively and authentic. Their success has led them to expanding the floor, which was the right choice. Great for date nights, lunch with coworkers and friends alike. I will be a regular at Pai for years to come!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eliscia M.,"My frst time here and I wasn't disappointed...the line was long but quick and there is a devoted following given how busy and big the place has become. 
Everyone who worked there were cool as cucumbers and friendly. The section we were sat in is under construction  (not that we were in the middle of it) but because of that we weren't able to order drinks.  So we just had water (it was warm out, the water cool and I didn't mind)
I ordered the beef Salas and egg rolls and my friend ordered the pad thai. My salad was crunchy, spicy,  sweet, sour ...overall a Symphony in my mouth. The beef was lightly jeweled in the middle but had this delicious crust on the outside...it was majical and in didn't share (wouldn't and couldn't cause I wanted to be greedy).
The egg rolls were great the added black pepper in the filling made them dynamic and something that wasn't heavy going down.
To end the meal we shared a coconut sorbetto....it was more like ice cream and in the dish was uber,  peanuts, rice crisps, tapioca  and few other things I'm sure I'm missing. It was cold,  creamy and very strong and lovely flavour of coconut. 
All in all a great meal  and I'll be coming back soon!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,YX Y.,"My friends and I have been loving this place, and we always go there for dinner. However, after we ate there again last night, both of us have been diarrhea and vomiting, so I decided to update my review.  
We ordered two Thai milk ice tea, two curries (which we always order) and Pai sausage plate for the first time. Both of us thought the sausages tasted a bit suspicious(it was sticky and raw), but none of us could tell why....  I hope the management of PAI finds out the reason...",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Delta B.,"Awesome restaurant. I always sit at the bar. Had a couple items and always impressed with the quality. Portion size is fair, which doesn't leave you hungry, but don't plan on left overs.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Doug N.,"I'm an out of towner and this was no ""traditional Thai. It is an experience, packed, every bite is an explosion of flavor. Check them out",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dorothy F.,"One of my favourite thai restaurant !! The vibe, Ambience , music and food is just amazing! Only thing is.. it's really popular so try to make reservation. :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Madison M.,Great Thai food in the heart of downtown Toronto. A definite dinner favourite but the lunch market is not to be overlooked as they have pre-made some of their best dishes so you can walk in and out in under 5 minutes.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dudley F.,"Came here while in Toronto for a conference. Managed to get a table on Sunday night without any wait but the place was definitely busy and there was a line out the door by the time we left.
Ordered the Khao Soi with drumsticks and it was phenomenal. Enjoyed my dinner with a Moscow Mule as well. Overall, a very good eat in a fun space.
Can be crowded and can get quite loud when it's busy. But overall, well worth a visit.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Viet L.,"Pai is great. Not just great but one of the best places to dine in Toronto in terms of deliciousness. Their authentic pad thai is a must try. The sweet-salty-savoury flavour they have developed surpasses all expectations within the city limits. Their Thai Iced Tea is so complex with flavour. Do not be discouraged with the amount of ice they put inside. Drink it slowly. The flavours change with the ice melting. 
The ambience is always busy and for good reason, the food and service is delicious. Expect a bit of a wait if you're dropping in.
Speaking of the service, once they accidentally made my (now fiancee's) Pad Thai mild when she asked for no spice (she's a lightweight when it comes to Scovilles) and they took it back immediately. The owner came out to profusely apologise and also comp'd us 50% of the cost while rushing the order through so we can still eat together. 
The quality of the food and service justifies the price (and it isn't that pricey).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kimberly M.,"Very popular. Lined up. The food is good but it's not outstanding and worthy of the hype. We had the squash fritters and they were not great. Green curry with chicken was flavorful. Pad thai was a bit sweet but noodles were well cooked. I have been to lots of thai restaurants and cook it myself, good but not great.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,BabyGirl,"The flavor is a bit too sweet for me, although I usually do like sweet and salty mixtures.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Autumn C.,"I have been looking for Thai food like this for a long time. The Pad Thai, my personal favorite was delicious, but the chicken Panang was out of this world - so rich and creamy. I am only in Toronto for 5 days and am definitely planning to come back before I leave.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Trang N.,"Went to Pai when I was in the neibourghood with my boyfriend and we were craving some tasty Thai food. Pai was an easy choice as my friends and I have been here many times before. We arrived at around 5:30 pm on a weekday so a queue hadn't formed yet although the restaurant was quite busy. Got a table inside after 2 mins of waiting.
Food: For two people we order 3 appetizers, 1 main and find ourselves comfortably stuffed. The tom yum soup I had was a small one but very tasty, not like the watery serving you usually get at other Thai places. Perfect size for an appetizer. We also ordered Gaeng Panang - chicken skewers with peanut sauce and fish sauce, and Laap salad. The skewers were flavorful and moist and go perfectly with peanut sauce. Laap salad was also great but might be too spicy for some. For main we shared a Pad Gra Prow which is basil stir fried pork with rice. The basil pork is soo yummy I swear I could have finished it all by myself!
Drinks: Thai iced tea is always our go to drink at any Thai place, as we love spicy food the tea helps to re balance your taste bud and ease some of the heat that makes you cry :"") My bf tried the Thai mojito which was nice but he didn't think it goes well with the food we ordered.
Ambience: the place has a young and cheerful vibe and quite noisy, very relaxed.
Service: it was quite busy so was kinda hard to get our server's attention
Price: total damage came to $96 for two so yes it's a 2 dollar signs
Giving four stars only because I've had lot of exposure to authentic Thai - used to go to Bangkok every year just for the food. The food here didn't blow me away but in the Toronto food scene Pai is one of the best Thai restaurants.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeff H.,"This place has amazing food. I work nearby and so I frequently get takeout for lunch. My favourites: Pad Thai (not the usual ketchupy crap but something on a completely other level); the massaman curry (hearty, rich, full-bodied in its flavours); the green curry (luxuriant). The dishes don't pound you with heat -- they're flavourful and nuanced. 
My only issue is that the price point is a little high -- $13.50 for the Pad Thai.  That said, it's very, very good and so I don't mind spending the $$ to have an excellent dish. I just don't do it as often as I might otherwise!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chloé P.,"We were a group of four and came on a Saturday night at around 8:00pm. It was mad busy. I'm guessing this is a popular spot for pre-drinks and grabbing a quick bite before heading off to enjoy the vibrant night life of the Financial District. (I might be wrong. I only go out like twice a year.) 
Anyway, Pai was suuuuuuper crowded. We were told there would be a one hour wait before getting a table for a group of four. In the end, we only waited about 20 minutes since they gave us seats in the no-drinking area (it was fine by us, but if you're looking for drinks, you're gonna be waiting a while). 
There were a lot of things we wanted to try, but the kitchen was out of a lot of ingredients, which was kind of annoying. It was a constant back and forth of ""we'll get item X"" and ""sorry we're out of that"" between us and the waiter. In the end, we went with vegetarian spring rolls, som tum tad (papaya salad), khao soi (egg noodles in creamy golden curry), gaeng kiaw wan (spicy green curry), and pad cha hett (king oyster mushroom dish).
The spring rolls were average. Everything else was great! The papaya salad was perfectly spicy. The green curry was supposed to come in a coconut but they had run out of coconut (lol) so it came in a regular bowl. It was super spicy and I personally had a really tough time with it (I'm hella weak when it comes to spicy food), so if you can't tolerate spicy then definitely avoid. The khao soi was soooooo good. It was super creamy and just all around yummy. My favorite was the king oyster mushroom. Definitely something I would want to re-order. 
Anyway, despite the fact that they were out of a lot of items, the food we got was still pretty darn good! Would definitely go back for more oyster mushroom.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kareem R.,"I'm now hooked. One of the top Thai restaurants in Toronto. The Khao Soi is my go to here, although I haven't had anything on the menu that was bad. Their cocktails are also solid. They used to have more Thai beer but it seems it's whittled down to just a few now. 
Can get pretty busy at lunch and right after work. Music is always on point.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristy A.,"Delicious!   I absolutely loved this place and was completely stuffed when I left.   We headed out a little before 8pm on a Friday.   The place was packed.  There was a line to get in line for a table, which was expected to be an hour.  Normally, I would have bagged it and gone somewhere else, but it smelled amazing in there and I couldn't leave.   
We decided to stick it out and try for a bar seat in the hopes of eating sooner.  Word to the wise - that won't work.  We spotted some people at the bar paying and snagged their seats, only to be told that the bar was considered part of the dining room and that the waiting list applied to it as well.  We were directed to a small waiting bench around the corner, where we had a couple of drinks before our table was ready.   
Once seated, we ordered 3 thai wings and the grabong - both were delicious.  The grabong reminded me of everything I love about funnel cake, but without the overly sweet powdered sugar that I don't like.  You could taste the squash and it wasn't greasy at all - a winner for sure.  The dipping sauce added just the right amount of sweet and salty.  
I followed that up with chicken pad thai (spice level 3) and the boyfriend got the massaman curry (spice level 4).  If I had a criticism about the food, it would be that there is a very large gap between these two spice levels.  Level 3 was perfect for me, but not spicy enough for the boyfriend.  His level 4 was crazy spicy.  I couldn't have eaten it and even he struggled a bit (though he did thoroughly enjoy it).   
The final dish was a mango sticky rice, which was delightful.  Warm rice and cool mango - the perfect ending to a really great meal.  Prices were pretty reasonable as well.   Service was a tad slow, but the place was packed, so I can see why.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raymond W.,"Came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and had a great experience.
Boring stuff: Food was excellent - had squash fritters for appetizer, and shrimp pad thai and basa fillets for entrées.   Lots of space at this location compared to khao san road.  We will definitely come here first before khao san and sukhothai.
Good stuff: Amazing 90s hip hop playlist featuring pharaoh monch, gangstarr, odb, and I think brand nubian was playing when we left.  5 stars for this alone.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen S.,"Pai is probably our top spot for Thai food in Toronto (close race with Sukothai). The serving staff is excellent, and the food is always delicious. 
Highly recommend the Pad Ga Prao, and Chef Nuit Pad Thai - but keep it mild if you don't take spice well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Neo G.,"Fantastic food. The restaurant is bigger than it looks and is in the basement of the building. A full bar with great drinks though the food menu is a bit limited. It's offered as ""northern"" Thai and not what I'd say is a traditional Thai menu but the food is great. Everything is house made AND they are very accommodating of food allergies. They were able to slightly adjust some entrees to accommodate multiple allergies in the same dish. This is rare and I'd go back just for this reason PLUS the food is delicious.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Louise W.,"We had the Penang curry, green curry and a noodle dish that were all out of this wed. We had the Thai Mint mimosas and they were also terrific. They had us sit on these cool pillows on the floor and it was fun. Check it out! It's super for people watching too.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Krista P.,"Delicious - fresh and flavourful. 
I love the food at Pai and the space is also fantastic. 
Do make a reservation unless you are prepared for a long wait (though it is worth it)
Soups are amazing - especially on a cold night .",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rainie L.,"Yum! Okay this place doesn't need any more reviews. It's got tons!!! Just make reservations, get your butt over here, and order the lemongrass iced tea and chicken pad Thai. Awesome meal for $20. So good! Love the chill vibes too. Place gets crowded and busy so if you don't like noise or people, you may not like the setting. In that case, get delivery!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ana H.,Great and delicious food! Long wait though since it's really popular. I thought it was worth the wait though!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diana V.,One of my most stops anytime I'm visiting from Halifax. Everything is so delicious but my go to has to be the pad Thai !! It's all so yummy. You won't be disappointed.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maddy Q.,"Friendly servers, great food, very filling. 
Khao Soi with Braised Beef is a must try. The pieces of beef are tender and the soup/sauce is rich and decadent thanks to the healthy dose of coconut milk. It comes with a chili oil, a few pieces of pickled veggies, and a wedge of lime. There is a twisted deep fried noodle crisp in the dish, which adds a great dimension of crunch. 
Usually there is a line for lunch, especially on weekends, so either come early, make a reservation, or come at atypical meal times. 
Only complaint: water was not refilled during service, but it is understandable as there were a full house.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David J.,Good Spot! Love the 80's / 90's Pop Culture stuff a d the food is tasty. Good location as well,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yuri P.,"We arrived later in the evening and found the restaurant very busy. We decided to wait anyways. The staff were very accommodating and got us seated in less time than expected. You have the option of sharing a table with others, which we did. This is a good way to be seated faster. We ordered the spring roles and shared a plate of pad thai. Both dishes were amazing. The atmosphere was very eclectic and the guests ranged in age as well as blend of cultures. Would highly recommend. The food came out very quickly and the service was very efficient considering the large crowd. Don't miss this place if you're visiting Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Liv K.,"Very busy restaurant but so worth the wait! In Toronto for 3 days and my husband are here twice and I joined for one meal.
Super chill vibe, tables are close together and some  shared spaces. 
Recommendations include: Khao Soi (braised beef), Pad Gra Prow (Holy Basil with Crispy Pork), ??Curry(coconut curry eggplant with fish) and a starter of Tom Yum. All highly recommended.
We also had two cocktails ... decent flavor but not a lot of kick... I wouldn't do a specialty cocktail again but you are there for the food!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark L.,It was fantastic! Had the papaya salad and the pad gra pow. Cool looking place with a great atmosphere. Highly recommend.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,YL L.,Super delicious and flavorful food! I usually don't like Thai but this was really good. Their sangria was great too. There was also cute traditional seating with cushions.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alina J.,One of my fav Thai places In the city! The place can get very busy and showing up without reservations could have you waiting for a while. The restaurant is bigger than it looks as they have a whole area In the back. The food is very tasty and quick service.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melissa N.,"Awesome!!! Difficult to get a table here, great underground place, just in downtown Toronto, atmosphere is so cool, nice music, good service.. but the food is to die for! Love it",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jalal C.,"- Definitely in the Top 3 restaurants at this price point
- While waiting for your food I highly recommend enjoying their specialty sangria. 
- The decor and ambience one of the many factors contributing to the overall feel of the place. 
- Must order : Khao soi with shrimp, Pad Gra Prow with Beef, papaya salad, 
- The chef personally came by to ask how everything was. Great touch that puts the restaurant in elite territory",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy J.,"This was one of the first restaurants that popped up around the area when I searched on yelp. Saw the amount of reviews and decided to give this place a try. Did not know how hyped it was until we got there. It was a Friday night. The restaurant was PACKED! For a party of 2, it was about a 45 minute wait. You put your name down and they give you one of those light up boxes to signal when your table is ready. Our server was very nice and attentive. We recommend the pork skewers! We tried the Tom yum soup (entree size) and pad Thai. The Tom yum soup was the highlight of the night. It was served on a pot and they have fire on the bottom to keep it warm. The soup was definitely good for a cold day. The pad Thai was good as well, very flavorful. We tried the thai mojito and fresh coconut juice which were tasty. Overall, I totally recommend this place but definitely get there early and put your name down if it's a weekend night!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arnold H.,"I ordered the chef nuit pad thai with chicken and also the gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut for dinner; both were wonderful dishes.
Chef nuit paid thai chicken - both the chicken and noodles were cooked and flavoured really well - the only improvement I would make is that there was too much chicken compared to the noodles (which is a rare thing for a restaurant to have more meat to noodle ratio). It felt like it was almost a chicken dish instead of a pad thai dish. Nevertheless, it was a delicious dish.
Gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut - the dish was pretty cool in that it comes in a coconut. The curry was very creamy with flavours of coconut and basil; I highly recommend this dish. Again, the curry to rice ratio was a bit off (there was too much curry compared to rice). However, it's much better to have too much curry than too little.
Overall, the dishes were delicious, and I highly recommend them for your next visit!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha X.,"First off, just want to clarify that I got my meal off DoorDash so there will be no review of the actual restaurant, service or ambience. 
What I ordered: Chef Nuit Pad Thai, with Beef, medium spice
Everyone raves about this dish so of course, it had to be the first thing I tried from Pai. To say the least, it was absolutely delicious, and I think Pamika's version in Montreal is very close if not just as good. Just straight up devoured within 10-15 minutes. 
The bad: I got an allergic reaction after eating this... but not to the peanuts (I got tested), so there's definitely something in here that's setting me off but man, I would definitely endure it again just to eat it. Also I wish it was a bit spicier, there were no descriptions of spice levels on DoorDash app so I assumed ""Foreigner Spicy"" meant toothpaste-level spicy (haha??), but I guess that's on me for not looking at the website menu 
Now just debating whether I should try it at home again or go to the restaurant for the full experience...",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela K.,"Everything about this place was great. From the hostesses to the servers, the funky vibe, and especially the food. We had the Grabong for an appetizer, and then Pra Grad Prow Shrimp and Chef Pad Thai for our entrees. Both plentiful, tasty and perfect spice level.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole L.,"Food alone maybe would be a 4.5.
The basil ground pork dish became my favourite thing to eat when I was in Thailand, so I had to order the Pad Gra Prow. Although not as much basil flavour as I was used to, it was still great . I had it in Thai spicy, which was perfect for me. Super flavourful and addictive. My friend had the khao soi which she loved. I tried a bit of her dish and found it to be rich, super coconuty and delicious. I loved the food there. That being said, I wasn't too hungry when I got there,.so it was just enough food for me. However, me and my friend both found the portion to be a bit smaller than expected. If I was hungry, I probably wouldn't have been satisfied. 
I also ordered a sangria but the bar gave me the wrong drink. I had already taken a sip of it so I told them it was fine when they asked if I wanted the drink i ordered. I have no idea what drink they gave me, but I hated it. I really wish I had gotten my sangria.....
Also we came here around 6 on a Friday n
ight and had to wait 40 minutes for a table. This place is super popular....I still just want my sangria!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah M.,"I have frequented this establishment and I must say I have never been disappointed. I have tried majority of items on the menu and they are all flavourful and unique. I really like the descriptions on the menu because it makes it super easy to bring guests who have any dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten free) which is rare for Thai restaurants. The atmosphere is fun and laid back and I would highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for some amazing Thai food !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Janille R.,"Amazing khao soi braised beef. Beef was so tender and amazing and it went so well with the noodles. It was amazing. And let me tell you, medium spice was perfect. It added enough kick. It was also very creamy and overall a great meal. 
My boyfriend ordered the green curry in coconut and that was bomb as well. The curry was the right kind of flavor and the coconut was fresh and added something a little sweet to the taste - which was refreshly delicious.
Service was great because we reserved prior. If you don't reserve, be prepared to wait because the line IP is always long on the weekends. The servers were quick to their feet and the friendly. The overall atmosphere was great -always packed but intimate enough to have a conversation in the dim lights. 
Definitely coming here again to try out more food. The mango with sticky rice was something that I really wanted to try but I was too full. The food is great, very filling and amazing for the price.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roxy J.,Excellent food! We ordered a wide array of items- and NONE disappointed! I actually felt beyond pleased with everything I tried! Go in a little early to beat the dinner rush- cuz it is CRAZY! Plan accordingly!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ruby S.,"LOVE PAI. Everything from the atmosphere to the food. Always a line up, but SO well worth it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jonathan L.,"Very popular place, as evident from the line that you will face if you did not make a reservation. The wait was around an hour, so my friends and I decided to just get take out. They said it would take around 40 minutes, but it came out a lot faster than that, which was great!
Food was pretty good. Nothing really mind blowing or extravagant, but it wasn't bad at all. Portion size seemed pretty reasonable for the amount you are paying for. Also the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful.
If I were to visit Toronto again, I don't know if I would visit Pai. It was good, but not to the point of making me want to go again. But overall, I would recommend if you're in the area. Probably best to make a reservation, unless you are okay with waiting or getting carry out.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rey N.,"GREAT food! Got the Oxtail & the Minced pork with rice and was delish.
TERRIBLE service. Waiters are overworked and inattentive, host is overwhelmed and rude to guests. Kitchen forgot to send our appetizers before our main dishes so we got stuff in reverse order (but not spaced out so we had to scarf down our food to make room on the table).
Would go here again just for the food - it's worth it. But don't expect to be catered to!
Also FYI the dishes are huge, just get 1 main dish per person.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adrian C.,This place is popping! Super lit but not actually it's dim lighting. Be prepared for the high key line. It's worth it because you'll be saying bless up with DJ Khaled when you start chowing down. Ya man. Food is moist. Broth is for real and chicken is clutch. Stay classy my food snobs.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristine D.,"Wow!  An amazing authentic Thai restaurant with a fun bustling atmosphere.  We arrived around 6:30PM on a Wednesday evening and the line was through the door.  Wait time was quoted as 20 minutes and we enjoyed a drink at the bar.  Great ambiance (fun to look at the photos/stories decorating the walls). Tom Yum soup was phenomenal.  Spring rolls, Pad Thai (signature dish?) were great.  Service was excellent.  Must do if craving great Thai",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Isabel L.,"I've been to Pai twice now and both times were amazing. I try to bring all my friends here. If it's Thai they are craving, it's Pai we are going to! The menu is straight forward and very cute. Their Khoi Soi is rich in flavour. I couldn't finish the entire portion so I packed to take away and mixed in rice and ate the rest for lunch the next day. 
I've also had the Pad Gra Prow. Personally I thought the portion size was a bit smaller than any noodle option but nevertheless still delicious. I need to try more on this menu, and maybe get dessert (Mango Sticky Rice) next time too. I will be back for sure!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dolly K.,My favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. Really delicious food. Always busy so you need to go during off peak times if you don't want to wait.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lesley L.,"Entering through the unassuming doors of Pai Northern Thai is a welcome reprieve from the freezing Toronto winter, where the red brick, wooden interior, and assorted souvenirs greet you like stepping off a plane and to a Thai street food stall. 
Very fair pricing for great portion sizing, no skimping on the ingredients or spices, which means no watered-down curries or soups but full-on flavoured dishes instead. Lunch offers even better deals, averaging at about $12 per entree, but even the regular dinner prices are more than fair.  If were ever a fan of the old Khao San Road, you'll be happy to see that many of the staff have moved on over to Pai with all the same friendliness, knowledge, and passion for the food. 
Standouts to me are: The spicy tom yum soup, crispy fried fish served with a little green curry on the side (smart, to keep the fish from becoming soggy with sauce), the sweet masaman braised beef, mango sticky rice dessert, and the milky sweet Thai iced tea.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Madison M.,"My favourite Thai place in Toronto by far. People know how good it is, so make sure to book a reso a day in advance, otherwise you'll be waiting about half an hour. The atmosphere is really laid back, has great music, and hip people. Their Springs rolls are to die for. Also a huge fan of their coconut curry and their pad tai is incredible. They have customizable spice levels, so people who don't like spice to people who like their mouths on fire will be happy. If you haven't tried this place yet you're missing out!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Umesh W.,"I was really surprised with Pai.
I didn't except this place to be this good. Most Thai food places around Toronto have not been authentic, and/or up to par.
We had several plates for lunch, they were all great (Pad Thai, Pad gra prow, Green Curry chicken/tofu). Couple of us were having Vegetarian plates while the rest had fish and chicken. They were all great. The wait staff was kind enough to let the Vegetarians know that there was fish sauce in some of the dishes.
The staff was also very nice, very friendly, very helpful!
The ambience is very pleasant, trendy.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David C.,"Delicious food, Can definitely have a wait. Fun staff and good drinks. One of the few places in downtown to get a good meal before a game within striking distance of the ACC & Skydome. When working downtown, try and get there between 11:30 and 11:45 to get a table for lunch.
I don't normally like pad thai but at Pai (and sister restaurants Sukhothai) their pad thai is pretty awesome. Delicious chili oil is a nice addition to a lot of their food which allows you to order a bit less spicy and adjust according to taste. I like to share my food but I also like it crazy spicy which makes the chili oil great. The Khao Soi is certainly one of the favorites but be forewarned about ordering it on a work day in a suit or if you're going to an event after. Curried noodles are not the tidiest of dishes especially when their this good and you want to slurp them down as fast as you can.
Generally good, authentic thai. Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork or Khao Pla Tawt are yummy. Good food to share all around. Try everything.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yawen Z.,"I went to there around 2p.m. but there were still many people inside!! The food was reaaally delicious!! Although the seats were a little crowded... The distance between every table was very small that I can hear about other people's talking ( sorry about that, I was not deliberated..) However, the stuff were all very nice. One girl asked us about the taste and even helped to adjust the spice degree of my friend's curry. 
Ok, the most important thing should still be the food, right? We ordered a Pad Thai with shrimp, a bowl of Tum Yum soup and a chicken curry. 
--The pad thai with sweet and sour sauce was the best! The peanut made it very aromatic and I love it so much! 
--Tum yum soup was much sour but I enjoyed it too. BTW, there were many shrimps in a small bowl.
--Curry with the Thai spice was a little spicy for my friend but just suited for me.. Definitely go back and try something else.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maxime O.,"No wonder there is always a line to get in. This Thai restaurant consistently blows my mind. My favourite dish is the pad gra prao. I could have it everyday.
They have a very nice drinks menu which makes it a fun and enjoyable place to eat.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bray E.,Tasted like dog food. The wait was long so it must have been good but I did not think so and nor did my taste buds. I would recommend you getting anything besides chicken broth.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Inbar R.,"We arrived without reservations and were sitted on the bar after around 10 minutes (on Sat around 3).
We got:
Moo Ping (Sweet Grilled Pork on a skewer) - fantastic!
Spring Rolls - great, light and not that industrious crap.
Chef Nuit Pad Thai - AMAZING. one of the best pad thai's I ever had (including those we got in Thailand)
Pad Gra Prow (ground pork with holy basil, on fried rice with an egg on top) - honestly, it was bad, but nothing amazing. just... OK.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy C.,"Excellent food, service and ambience. My only complaint is that it can be difficult to get seating as the restaurant is so popular!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fabrizio C.,"Came here with my fiancee, and ordered the yellow curry for the first time. Needless to say that I am now addicted to it. It came even in a coconut!! We had the large mojito which was ok, and our neighboring table told us not to get the sangria as it was mainly juice. Other than that, long-ish wait as it is so popular but definitely well worth it!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tina L.,"PAI
A different change of scenery - warm, romantic countryside - from Khao San and Sukhothai without any compromise on the street style . Our server was lovely. It was a great spot to chill on some Singha's which was followed by a challenge with the unfinished wooden washroom latch that really made me feel like I was in a place away from the city. One of my favorites.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amrinder S.,"Spring roll was tasty, Chicken wings were ok. Khao Soi was yummy but little sweet. Thai Iced tea was amazing.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cara K.,"One of my favourite restaurants!! There's often a wait, and it's worth it. We put our names on the list and go for a drink next door.
Must haves at Pai are the Moo Ping, green curry (in a coconut), pad graw pra (beef), beef cheek soup.
They also make an excellent Moscow mule.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adam F.,"Amazing food, wonderful service & staff, and an authentic vibe which wreaks of classic rock and roll and good times.  Wish I lived in Toronto so I could enjoy this place more.  I just left and want to go back again already.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sanna M.,"Must try the green curry and the beer! Love the vibe of the place, feels like a community of happy people. The wait is a  bummer but you gotta wait for good food!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rebecca G.,"In the mood for some good food, my friend and I went to Pai Northern Thai Kitchen for dinner last night. Because we arrived late (9:30), we were immediately seated at- still- what appeared to be the only table available, and we quickly placed our drink orders.
Choosing a Singha and a Tom Yum Caesar respectively, we continued with shares of the Moo Ping and the Pad Cha Hett. The pork of the Moo Ping was both tender and flavorful, and the Pad Cha Hett, or a vegan Shimeji mushroom stir fry, was delicious! Prepared with homemade red chili paste, snow peas, bamboo shoots, basil leaves, wild ginger, and peppercorn, and served directly over steamed jasmine rice, it was the perfect main to accompany the pork skewer appetizer.
The service was both friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was hip. Pad Northern Thai Kitchen is an excellent representative of the diverse dining options that Toronto has to offer.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Becca S.,Amazing Thai food and a funky urban vibe! Had the chicken Pad Thai and spring rolls and it was the BEST I've ever had!! Cool music and hip ambiance. A must try in Toronto!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mohamed M.,Braised beef is Halal there so people like me who eat Halal meat can try Braised Beef Khao soi. It's very nice.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Judy W.,Best Thai restaurant in Toronto. Can't believe it was fully packed during lunch time. Beef curry and Kao Sai were awesome,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole F.,"Went to PAI on 12/29/18 at 4pm. ""Warm"" was our server and came back after 30 minutes to let us know she forgot to punch in our order since she lost the sheet she wrote it down on. We got two appetizers, two meals and take out. Horrible to hear when you're starving and looking forward to a nice date night out. The food arrived after another 15 minutes only for the spicy green curry to have no flavour and be lukewarm. The fried rice we had was ok. Our server never came back to check on us.
We then paid (nothing comp'd) and had to wait for our take out again. We did not see our server since we told her our order a second time. 
Won't be returning.. poor customer service and tasteless food.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jasmine J.,"Soooo good! My friends and I came in hungry and looking to sample as many things on the menu as possible. Everything was amazing! 5 stars for the starter soup, grabong, spring rolls, Thai fried rice and the green curry. Let's not forget the mango and sticky rice! Yummmm!!! The pad thai was just ok- wouldn't order that again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Irina A.,"Really good vibes and fun place with good food. The second time there, the food was a bit disappointing..",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katherine P.,"My husband and I loved this restaurant! The Thai food was amazing, and drinks were great!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ra S.,"I don't know anyone who doesn't love Pai. Great Thai food in a unique space. 
All the staff are friendly and easy going. 
If you're in the mood for Thai and are in the area I would highly recommend stopping by.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer L.,"Definitely the most hipster Thai resto I've been to!
We shared amongst a party of three the green curry in a coconut, chef nuit pad thai, and the khao soi.  
Perhaps my taste in food is becoming increasingly less refined the more restaurants I try but the simplest pad thai dish was my favourite.  Tbh it didn't taste that much different than the ones you have at Thai franchise restos, but I quite liked it.  The cream to food ratio was also a bit heavy for the khao soi and curry - add more protein please, Pai.
Service was great, waiters were fun to talk to and the Winter Dog was a delicious drink.  Overall, the ambiance was superb and made my dining experience A+.  Bring your hipster frands here, they'd like it",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Junction A.,"Probably the best Thai place in Toronto. I've been enjoying their dishes since they first opened Kao San Road and have been her many many times. Consistently delicious and full of flavour that you want when eating thai food. The Kao Soi with braised beef is my go to and I can't get enough.
If you haven't been go there NOW!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex C.,"I have eaten here and ordered it on Uber eats.  Food is always good, a little bit pricey but worth it.  The atmosphere is always buzzing and reminds me of actually eating at a restaurant in Thailand.
The Chefs Pad Thai (faarang spicy) is the best!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Krish K.,"Incredible ambience with some great drinks and fantastic food. 
Had the khao suey ,the chicken green curry and the penang curry. Had no complaints. Food was flavourful and cooked perfectly. Ordered the caeser to drink as Pai is very famous for it and now I understand why.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tiffany T.,"The long overdue post about Pai Northern Thai Kitchen. Pai is by far one of the most well known authentic Thai places in the heart of downtown Toronto! This has been on my foodie list for around a year now. We waited aprox 15 mins which isn't too bad around prime dinner time. We then waited 30 mins for the food to come.. here we got the khao soi, pad thai & the fried butternut squash fritters. To start off, when the food arrived, it was all cold. Now considering the fact we waited so long, why is the food cold ? And the fried fritters were also soggy and half of it was just batter. The khao soi's beef was hard and not even appetizing. Pad thai was also mediocre at best. However, the taste of the dishes were great and flavorful, just wish the food was at an appetizing temperature. Would we come back ? Probably not. Is this place overhyped? Probably yeah.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brent C.,Incredible Thai food. Line ups are long but worth the wait. I have friends who've travelled to Thailand several times and they claim Pai has the best to Thai food outside Thailand!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ali A.,"Pai is a busy restaurant with great Thai food. I shared Khao soi, fried rice, and squash fritters. 
The squash fritters were essentially sweet potato fries on crack. Crispy with a sweet and sour tamarind sauce. Beef Khao soi was rich in flavor. Fried rice was alright. I recommend getting Khao soi and sharing it with a side of steamed rice. You don't want to waste that sauce.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Britney S.,"Came for a visit with a group, the ambiance was great and very authentic. The food was good and above average compared to other Thai restaurants, but still a little overly sweet.  We ordered 6 or 7 different dishes so that we could try a bit of everything, but our favourite was the Khao Soi. I can understand why everyone raves about this restaurant, I think I prefer the Laotian/Thai flavours more.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dakini T.,My soup arrived lukewarm and the service is poor. The food is tasty if it wasnt for the lack of attention to service.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eliz L.,Great food 5/5 (sometimes even better than authentic Thai food from Thailand! Lol) but giving this place 4 stars because whenever I go it's so packed and loud. Hard to enjoy the dinner unless you're in the mood for loud conversation and hectic-ness. Maybe try take out instead or go at a low time.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tian Pu P.,Awesome place for thai food. Recommended for to all my friends. Great for vegetarians. Got to watch out because it is usually packed so reserve ahead of time. Cheap $5 shots and decent price on drinks. One of the beat thai restaurants in Toronto,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelly C.,"I have been to Pai several times now and they never disappoint!
The best authentic Thai food I have eaten. I usually get the green curry with some satay. They are so delicious, fresh and flavourful I will keep coming back. It's expected that their is a wait for this place so I recommend getting a reservation if you can.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda D.,"We came here with a VERY special guest so perhaps it was the reason we got extra special service but I loved everything about this place! The atmosphere and location itself is romantic, cozy and you feel as though you can relax and be yourself.
We started off with the delicious veggie spring rolls. They were extremely flavourful, crispy and not greasy which I find is usually the case with deep fried spring rolls. The thai chilli sauce was everything and more!
We then got some ""Gaeng Kiaw Wan with shrimp. It's a coconut curry soup which was delicious! I am not a fan of curry but it was delightful, spicy and had great depth and flavour. It's enough to share with three people or if you are a curry lovin' soup fan- just for one!
After we received our main courses. I went with the Khao Pad Thamada with chicken- DELICIOUS. Everything about this dish was fresh, portion size was big and the depth of flavour was out of this world. It was probably my favourite thing that I had all night.
You actually feel as though you are eating home cooked meals at Pai and that their food is made with lots of love and attention.
I'll certainly return to Pai Northern Thai Kitchen :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J W.,"Usually very good, knocked a star off as sometimes it's inconsistent for take out. Will return for patio or indoor dining",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leon T.,"I don't think this place has ever failed me or anyone I know. The food is amazing! 
The only complaint I would have is the spice level is a bit inconsistent, so if spicy isn't your thing then tread lightly.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ry T.,"Of all the places Hubby and I dined at in Toronto, this was my second fav where I liked the food. Even better than the 360 Degrees Restaurant in the CN Tower.  
We arrived at 6 PM and the place was packed. The wait was about 25 mins on a busy Friday nite. Not a good idea to sit outside. While leaving, we saw couples sitting at the outdoor tables with no one serving them. 
We tried 3 items. The fried egg rolls were OK and served with a tangy dipping sauce.  I wouldn't order again tho.  The beef curry had the most flavor with very tender chunks of cubed beef.  The chicken noodle dish was good but the beef curry had better flavor. 
I particularly enjoyed the Thai iced tea which had too much slushy ice in it.   Less ice and more creamy tea would be better.  By the time we left the line had stretched from the basement staircase to out the door.  Our server was very nice and the staff checked on us twice during the meal.  She told us she has been working there since they opened 2 yrs. ago.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kuruvinth V.,"If you're look for good Thai food then Pai is the place to check out.
Chef Nuit's Pad Thai is extremely flavourful and is probably my go-to meal at Pai. I've tried all the starters and I would rank Pai as one of the top restaurants in Toronto when it comes to their appetizers. My wife, who's vegetarian, usually goes for the vegan green curry and has nothing but good things to say about it.
Don't order Pai through UberEATS though. It's probably not fair to compare ordering food for delivery to eating at a restaurant, but the last time I ordered through UberEATS it tasted like Thai Express.
Out of all the Thai spots in Toronto, especially since Khao San Road closed down, I would have to say that Pai tops them all!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauretta ..,"I heard of this place for like thousands of times from several friends of mine. They are all big fans of this restaurant, and praised it as the best among the best Thai restaurants in Toronto. Firstly I tried to make a reservation for a lunch on Wednesday but it was unavailable since all seats were booked. I was so amazed by its popularity! So finally my reservation was made 4:30 pm that day, for a early dinner lol. My friend and I ordered two green curry, one papaya salad and sticky rice with mango. The food was absolutely great! Very Thai-style. And perfect for spicy food lover just like me. ( Forgot to ask them make it more spicy so the green curry was medium spicy and it was fine) But I think it was normally great, rather than all the legends I heard from my friends lmao. When we finished and left around 6 pm, there were about 10 peoples lining up at the entrance. It's a weekday guys! So I recommend reservation if you planed to go there days ago. Dropping by would make you standing and waiting.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Beta J.,"First time visiting Toronto from California! I had such high expectation for this place before coming because it has so many reviews and very high rating. I am an absolute Thai food maniac so I was really excited. However, I was pretty disappointed today after getting lunch there. 
I got the:
1) Plah Nua (Beef Salad) 
2) Pak Boong Fai Deng (Morning Glory) 
3) Tom Yum Kung Mor Fai 
4) Gaeng Klaw Wan (in a coconut) 
The first two was fine, about average. My friends did not like the curry because they thought it was bland but personally I thought it was okay. It was quite unique too being serviced in a coconut, but I really have to say the quality of the chicken was pretty bad. 
However, the Tom Yum was really disappointing. Yes, I have to admit that it had a strong flavor. BUT it's a strong flavor that tastes more like pre made tom yum soup. I don't know if it usually tastes this way but I think it tasted like it was made with Tom Yum powder that's sold in grocery stores. I could not taste the flavor of the shrimps and the lemon grass, which was supposed to be really strong and in my opinion, absolutely required in a good tom yum soup.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nitin A.,This is probably the best Thai restaurant I have been to ever (of all the places I've been to in DC/SF/NYC and Toronto areas). Totally worth the wait to be seated.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kimberley G.,Ate here for dinner when traveling for work. Loved the very eclectic decor and patrons. Delicious tai food and interesting options. Huge servings and I was sad I couldn't take home the leftovers.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Somya A.,"I found this place has very high ratings on yelp hence we went there. There was 30 min wait on a weekday and food took another 30mins to come. I am giving two stars because of our server. She was very unpleasant and gave us weird looks while taking order. Not at all welcoming and didn't even listen to our special requests. I ordered the curry with vegetables and no tofu but she ignored it completely. Above that, the vegetables in the curry were too big and mostly raw cauliflower. I didn't like the service and the food quality both.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine T.,Really good food. It's just a little loud and is definitely crowded. We had to share the table with other customers which was okay. I would give a 3.7 star but I'll round up to 4. The service was also great.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emma N.,"Really poor customer service. Sent the wrong order by delivery. No apology and incredibly unprofessional staff. Said they would send a replacement, after 90 minutes of waiting cancelled the order. Absolute joke.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia Z.,"The massaman curry with the braised beef. I still dream about it. If I ever go to Toronto again, this is definitely going to be a stop.
My friends and I came here on a rainy saturday night. The place was packed and we had to wait about an hour, but we did it because the yelp reviews were so great. And it was totally worth it. This is hands down the best Thai food I have ever had!
Also, they have pictures that tell the story of the couple who own the restaurant. It's so cute, check it out if you're waiting for your table.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sue A. Z.,"the wait time to be seated is insane, and once you're seated good luck getting served, or getting water even. This place is way too busy. The food is good, but not worth the wait and the slow service. I stayed thirsty the whole time because it was hard to wave down a server to get water.
I've gad the coconut curry and the khao soi beef, both pretty good, although they were really sweet. But we avoid coming here because of the wait (and before you call, no, they DON'T take reservations).",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ali A.,First off the atmosphere is so great. The host welcomes you and is very friendly. Sit anywhere and you will enjoy your experience. The food was great we ordered the Pad Thai. The right size portion and heat was delightful. A must to stop by.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yoga S.,"Food is fantastic.  But service is hit or miss.
The first time I went the server was a very nice South Asian fellow.  He was pleasant and catering to our needs.  The second time I went the server was short, South Asian woman with hair down to her chin level.  The interaction with her was absolutely brutal.  No smiling.  No acknowledgement of requests.  I seriously don't care for bad service like this.  The food is great but as I said, service can be quite hit or miss.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zoe L.,"The first thing attracted me is the overall decoration. It is so exotic and cute. The staff is nice too.
Ordered khao sai and mango steaky rice.
The khao sai is good overall. The curry is ""dense"" I would say. You tell they put a lot of effort in it. But I don't like the chicken, kind of dry.
The mango steaky rice is amazing, super awesome. Come in a nice display. The rice is still a little warm, blend well with the mango.
Nice place to go for tai food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shirley L.,"This is a really interesting little place tucked away on Duncan Street, just north of King St. I came here on a Monday night around 6:30 PM for dinner and was lucky enough to get a table for two. Apparently most people will call beforehand and make a reservation, and the guy at the front told us that usually they don't even take same-day reservations because they get booked full beforehand. Just something to keep in mind.
The place wasn't super super loud, so it made it fine in terms of making conversation. I will say it was quite dim though, so I wasn't really a fan of that. Overall though it's got a pretty cool, laid back vibe, I noticed some colourful paintings hanging at the back. I also thought the service was quite good, since our server was very prompt in terms of taking our order, serving our food, and checking up on us, and she was very friendly and helpful as well when she was explaining the different levels of spiciness we could select for our food.
We split an appetizer, which was Moo Ping (northern Thai sweet grilled pork on a skewer.) It was tasty, but expensive, at $10 for 3 skewers. We also ordered pad thai and a green curry, which came served in a coconut, which I thought was cute! I like how this place let's you to customize the level of spice in your food, since I can't handle spicy foods. Although there is an option for no spice, I ended up getting my pad thai mild, and that was fine for me. We got the curry to be medium, and even though it had a coconut milk base, it was too hot for me.
I quite enjoyed my pad thai, which had a strong peanut flavour too it, but it wasn't too much that it overwhelmed the other flavours in the dish. I'm not really an expert on Thai food, so it's hard for me to rate or compare, but I think it was pretty comparable to Khao San Road. I will say that I quite enjoyed my meal though, and I would like to come back to try some of their drinks as well as some of their more interesting dishes!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Reza K.,"Food is good spicy, ambience is cool. Service a bit slow but friendly. You better plan in advance or face a big line up.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Enayaa W.,Order to pickup. Specifically pescatarian dishes. I ordered tomyom soup but they put chicken in it :(,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Annie N.,"Came here on a Friday night without reservations and waited about 40 minutes for a table for 4; luckily there were ample waiting spots inside so it wasn't too bad. We didn't have a seating preference and so were seated at one corner of the restaurant where you had to take off your shoes and sit on these mats - I only saw 2 tables that offered seating like this so I always thought there'd be a longer wait so it was cool to finally try it out! 
My friends and I ordered the gabrong (squash fritters) to start as it is my biggest recommendation here (and at Khao San Road and Sabai Sabai). It's a mountain of deep fried spaghetti squash with an excellent garlic tamarind sauce. It's good enough to share with 4~5 people although I have devoured this on my own once depending on how hungry you are.
For mains, most of us got the Khao Soi and our other friend got the green curry which was served in a cute little coconut. Portions were quite friendly and all of us struggled to finish our plates. I loved the crispy noodles they put in the Khao Soi, made for a great texture combined with the rice noodles. I do wish they had put some veggies or something in there though, the dish felt kind of plain.. I would also recommend adding some chilli or hot sauce to the dish as well - it wasn't spicy at all and needed a bit of a kick.
Overall, the atmosphere here would remind you of hostels in Thailand so it's a great vibe and casual spot to get together with a group of friends. The place is quite big as well so it'll be easier to get seated. However, just based on my preference, I would rather go to Sabai Sabai (especially for their tapas style dinner) for better food and a more refined atmosphere.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,K D.,"Long line up but definitely worth the hype. For the money, the food is excellent. Their curry comes in coconuts. And it's amazing! Their khao soi is also fab. Service is always decent despite the busyness of the place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jethro C.,I'm not a big fan of Thai food but I absolutely love this place! The only con I can say about this place is that it does get super busy and the wait time is around 45min so be prepared for that. Regardless their green curry in a coconut is definitely worth the wait (10/10!). Best Thai food I've tried in Toronto and is without a doubt a restaurant everyone should try.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amelia J.,"- good ambience
- great service
- fresh, delicious food. Strong flavours, well executed.
Will be back for sure.  Hope it doesn't get Khao San crazy.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Allison B.,"Went during winter 2017. 
Best Thai food I have eaten in Toronto.  Fresh and wonderful. Good about making things vegetarian. 
It is a busy place so expect long line ups, but well worth the wait!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Meaghan C.,"Quite possibly the best Thai I've ever eaten and I'll list this as one of my best eating experiences of all time. Great ambience, service, and the food was incredible! We had pad Thai and green curry served in a coconut. Delish!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grace Y.,"Love!! Pad Thai was out of this world-- best I've had in Toronto :)
Awesome vibe and ambiance, service can be a bit slow but overall still pretty friendly. Had the Pad Thai, and my friends had the Pad Gra Prow and the Khao Pad Thamada. All dishes were great-- no complaints. The drink menu seemed interesting but we all had too much to drink the past few days and decided to stick with water :( 
Excited to come back soon!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hara W.,"I am always a fan of Northern Thai cuisines, and was very happy to scout one in Toronto during my visit.
Although the restaurant could seat 200-300 (my guestimate), it was already fairly crowded at 5pm when we entered. We were seated right away in a large table sharing with two other parties, but all the parties were far away enough to allow relatively private conversations
We ordered green curry and the Northern Thai traditional coconut curry noodle soup (khao soi gai) - both were yummy, authentic, and above all, very fairly prices :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John C.,"The bar I measure all Thai restaurants by, is the Lotus of Siam in Vegas. It is spectacular -- see my (or Anthony Bourdain's) review. 
So imagine my delight, as I need a place to go after a concert at Roy Thomson Hall and search Yelp, discovering this spot. 
Upon arrival, I had downstairs with my three little kids (8,5,3) in tow, and see a bar and wonder if I've made an error. The place is packed, at 5:15 pm. They get us a spot within minutes, and start taking our order comfortably fast. 
I zoom in on Thai beef salad, Pad Thai and a few other dishes. To summarize, they were terrific. The side fresh home made Thai hot sauce, was equally great. Normal I order everything stupid spicy, and unfortunately I could not, due to my little rascals. But they gave me fresh hot chillies and sauces galore to keep my palate on fire. 
Once finished, we noticed the line. Out the restaurant! 
Obviously this gem was only a secret to me. I'll be back, many, many, many more times to come.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Min C.,"A-MAZINGGG.  Alot of people are saying that this place is better than rhao san road in toronto, but I have to disagree. I still think this place is kick ass though.  I came home to toronto for 3 weeks after being away for a year and went to this restaurant twice haha. A must get to start is the fried squash fritters. I know its fried food but its not overly oily and the dish is huge!  I was obsessed with dipping them in the garlic sauce it comes with. nomzzzzz.
For lunch i had the green curry with shrimp - I wasn't crazy about this dish.  It was alot more sauce than anything else and only like 5 shrimp in it.  it was REALLY spicy for me but I honestly can't handle much spice.  I also think it lacked coconut milk.  The dinner dish of curry is better because it comes served in a real coconut :)
For dinner I tried the pad thai.  Second best pad thai in toronto! Then I also tried the green curry with fish (legit only 3 pieces -common trend here) and the braised beef curry.  i LOVED the braised beef curry. There were lots of beef chunks in it and the curry had the perfect amount of kick to it for me.  I would definitely recommend this place and will be back for sure to try other dishes!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vito C.,"Best Thai in the city. Hasnt missed once. My only complaint is that its too hard to get a table at lunch time. But its worth it when you do. 
The green curry is outstanding.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marçel S.,"Super busy place. We had a reservation for 7pm and they kept us waiting until 7:35 before we could sit.
Atmosphere is nice, smelled like ocean and the music wasn't too loud.
Food was simple but well done. Nothing blew me away, plating was average. Lots of sugary sauces... The one thing our whole table agreed on was they perfectly spiced everyone's dish. Not too hot, not too mild.
Service was solid. Food came out decently fast for how busy it was.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jijijijija L.,"Okok, so this is pretty obvious. 
For people who want to know if pai is better than khao San Road:
Noodle lovers: Pai
Rice lovers: Khao San Road
Have to try: Thai ice tea(for people who love sweet), Grabong, Chiang Mai beef noodle soup, and Khao soi",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Krishna A.,"Great Thai food in downtown Toronto! Service definitely could have been a little bit more attentive and music a little quieter, but good food deserved the 5 stars. Pad Thai was some of the best I've had outside of Thailand. Curries were served in a coconut which was cool! The cocktails were all very unique and Thai tea was bomb! Would definitely come back and recommend to others.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny F.,"Party of 9 got there around 4:30pm with my family, seated immediately. Food and drinks were great.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jim C.,"Great food and always busy.  The tables are close together but I have eaten there 5 times and it is consistently great.  Usually eat my go-to, Pad Thai, but have tried other dishes and all are excellent.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sammy P.,Amazing green chicken curry!!  Great service as well.. sometimes it's a wait for a table though,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carly L.,"If you like Thai food, you cannot miss this little gem. The staff are amazing - everyone is very friendly. We used to eat at Khao San Road so when we found out the chef opened this place, we had to follow. 
The setting is super trendy and fun. It feels like you're in trendy Thailand. 
We're so glad we found this place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex G.,"We went to Pai on a friends recommendation and looking at the queue we decided to go for take out.we ordered a chicken satay, Kai go prow which is ground chicken on rice and a pad Thai with chicken. I loved the chicken satay and Pad gra prow but the pad Thai was more on the average side. The only reason I'm giving a 4 star rating is that the quantity did not make justice to the price we paid. We were 3 of us with a bill of 50$ and it did not fill us up so we had to order pizza again. Disappointed in the quantity of the food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nancy F.,"I wanted the Tom Yum Nam Sai Kung Mor Fai soup in mild, but the only option was medium spicy. However, I loved it :D The description reads ""A savoury, spicy and sour shrimp soup with lemongrass, coriander and green onions. Served with jasmine rice"" It has a delicious sweet, sour, and spicy taste. The shrimp was perfect, and I liked the mushrooms too. It is served with a bowl of Jasmine rice, and I like that you can ask for more rice. If it's too spicy for you, they provide you with a big jug of water which should be enough for the whole meal.
Reasonable price, good portions, good service.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Boris Y.,"The place is packed even at 5pm, it will be better for you to make reservation if you need a table of 2 or more. Unless you don't mind sitting at the bar table. I had chicken pad Thai, it tastes so good, I would recommend anyone who likes Thai food to go to PAI. I don't think you will be disappointed. I will have to go back to try other dishes they have!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine E.,This is the best restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. The service was exceptional. There had to be over ten small meals that came out. The wine pairing was an experience as well. If you don't love wine it's something you may not want to pay for. Can't wait to go again.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel S.,"Favourite Thai food in Toronto. Great atmosphere. 
Sometimes there is a long line out front but it always moves quickly. 
Almost feeling like I should post a bad review just so that it doesn't become any more popular  
But I just can't it's too good.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kerr N.,"Pad Thai and Thai iced tea was bomb, the curry and the rice with the fried egg thing was meh. It's pretty dark in there so you can't really see if you're blind like me.. the service was slow but it's a given since they were nearly a full house and we had to share a table with another couple. We might be back!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sam F.,A go-to Thai place downtown! Fantastic spot in the back for a quick lunch! On Ritual as well so it's great for takeout!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raj V.,"This is my new favorite Thai restaurant in the GTA. The interior is very casual with the main front dining area quite hustling. Request a table in the back region or in the small section connecting the two when making reservations if you prefer a quieter experience. The service was prompt and friendly. I have enjoyed the Pad Thai, spring rolls, papaya salad, khao soi with my favorite being the Tom Yan soup! Spice levels are variable as requested but the extreme heat level is no longer available.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lanyi L.,"WOW this is probably the best Thai food I've ever had! Granted I haven't had that much Thai food, but I really enjoyed it. I had the Pad gra prow. The portion is smaller than expected, but it was enough to keep me satisfied. I had a bit of my friend's Khao soi and it was also really good! Much bigger portion too (I'll get it next time). I really enjoyed the casual and young atmosphere in the restaurant. My only complaint is that our server was very unresponsive-- it took us 20 minutes to just get water, and sometimes she was just standing around--but I saw other servers who were more prompt. Other than that my experience was really good.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elena S.,Great food and service. The only thing I would not recommend is the oxtail. The green curry and chicken wings were amazing!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eva C.,"From the service to the ambiance to the food and drinks, whether you are dining with family or hanging out with friends...you can never go wrong with Pai. 
I have visited Pai twice (both times on a Sunday around 5:00 PM) and I was seated right away each time. I never made reservations, but I would suggest making one if you have a large group, or just arrive soon after the restaurant opens because it gets pretty busy as the night goes on. 
Probably because it was not busy when I last visited Pai, the host let me sit at a table in the cushioned floor seating area even though I was still waiting on my three friends. It was a longer wait than expected, but it was not an issue for them (there were multiple empty tables and I made sure to ask every time someone checked up on me). 
Drinks:
* Thai Iced Tea -- a must-drink every time
* Pai Sangria -- never tried, but looking forward to it on my next visit :)
Starters:
* Thai Style Chicken Wings (3) -- good but nothing special
* Grabong -- something different and a good portion for more than 2 people
Mains:
*Khao Soi with braised beef -- very tender, flavourful, and big portion = very filling!
*Gaeng Kiaw Wan (in a coconut) with chicken -- creamy curry, full of flavour, and you can scrape and eat the coconut 'meat' at the end of your meal (hands down, my favourite dish at Pai)
*Gaeng Masaman with braised beef -- reminded us of beef rendang, which was good but nothing special
*Pad Gra Prow with pork -- simple yet delicious (my friend devoured the entire plate)
I cannot wait to dine at Pai again. Not only would I like to sip on their sangria, I would love to try some of their soup dishes, too.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Juan C.,"Delicious delicious food! The menu is simple but everything they do is really good. You can choose how spicy you want it so that is also a plus.
Best rice I have ever had...
I would say it's a perfect Thai place even for those who think Thai food is too spicy..it isn't. Try it and you'll keep coming back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bahareh A.,"I love this place. The food is great, but it's very noisy and not the best choice to have a conversation. They tried to place as many tables there as possible, so there's not much of privacy between your table and others.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cynthia G.,"Love this place !! 
Love the atmosphere ! 
Like the music - not sure how Bob Marley fits, but would have liked some Thai music maybe.  
Love the service !! 
Shared the Shrimp appetizer - it was just okay. 
Ordered Signha beer - yummy - tasted like beer should taste !!
We ordered the green chicken curry served in a coconut !!! Fantastic and delicious ! 
We mentioned to our server that we were going to Thailand later this year and he gave us some great travel tips !! 
I'm sure we will be back before our trip to try a few more items as they have a really large selection of items and it's real authentic Thai food",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Allen K.,"Thai cravings? PAI it is. 
I love the mood & food. The place is usually packed, at least from my experience , so call in ahead for reservations.
I can't remember the menu I had off the top of my head but ask the servers for recommendation(s); you won't regret your visit here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew S.,"This is the most imaginative, high quality food Thai restaurant in Toronto. Great fun and passion from the staff. Come early, make reservations or just be prepared to wait in the lineups...",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tony L.,Ordered off Uber eats recently. Probably the best Thai food in the city! Yummmmm!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jasmine B.,We absolutely loved Pai. I recommend calling in a reservation for anyone wishing to visit.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tania T.,"So so good. Everyone in my group of four got a different dish and the flavors were rich, ingredients fresh and overall atmosphere and service were on par. Would highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joel N.,"Ate at the bar, ordered a green curry with chicken. Took all of 15 mins to get ready. It came out in a coconut, and there was more in a separate bowl, explaining in a fantastic thai accent ""it would not be fair if just coconut bowl"". So a great portion. 
This sounds ridiculous, but I've tried green curries all over the world - including across Thailand. Pai does justice to authentic thai food. If you really like spice you can cope with ""very spicy"" - they Candianize the spice level. Overall 4 stars.
Service was great as well. I'll be back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dawn S.,"The food was good. Wait time was a little long but they were rather busy with the dinner time rush. Haven't tried takeout here but hear it is not as good as dining in, which is about what you'd expect at any restaurant. Portions were OK. The establishment was clean and most importantly the bathroom was maintained clean.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rimpal K.,"Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had! The drinks are delicious, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is awesome! 
Anyone I've taken here or recommended this place to has always agreed.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Caitlin C.,"My friends who grew up in Thailand introduced me to this place recently as an authentic Thai restaurant they really liked. Just the fact that they would recommend it was quite the statement in itself. After trying it, no disappointments at all, and it is easily now the best Thai place in Toronto for me. I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with thanks to the server's recommendation, and would highly recommend it to others as well. It's a fried rice dish that doesn't look fancy, but tastes very rich and flavourful. My friends ordered curry and other dishes, all of them had nothing but good things to say. 
As for the interior and exterior of the place, it doesn't catch your eye off the street or dazzle upon first impression. It actually felt like walking downstairs into an old basement pub, but upon entry, we were warmly greeted and felt quite comfortable. The waiters and waitresses were really friendly and ours even shared some conversation with us. I highly suggest reserving in advance on weekday nights and weekends. The place gets crazy busy and usually has a long wait. We didn't have much of a wait coming on a weekday afternoon though.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alison G.,"Everything we had was excellent. Highly recommend the chicken wings, spring roll and pork skewer appetizers. Entrees were delicious as well - everyone enjoyed (and also wished they had ordered medium instead of mild), but the appetizers stole the show.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anisha C.,"This place is definitely overrated and there portions are a bit too small. One main dish will not fill you, you need an app. It's decent but I've had better in Toronto.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine C.,What I ordered was good but doesnt get 5 stars. Why? Cause it wasnt something special. I am a spoil new Yorker which plenty of Asian food options.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ha Song P.,How the hell does this place get 4.5? Ok i get that the decor is nice and service is good. But the food though. I got green curry and it's not even spicy??? Like how is this Thai food. More like white people's Thai food...,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel P.,"One of the best Thai places I have been to so far (in Germany and Canada). Have tried about 40% of their dishes on the menu. Their curries are very creamy and delicious and the pad Thai is great, too. Can't get enough of it that's why I try to go there at least once a week.
This place is always crowded whenever I go there (lunch and dinner) and you may have to wait in line for 10 to 25 min. It may also get very noisy but the food is worth it.
(Note: I have never been in Thailand so I don't know what real Thai food tastes like)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erin E.,"We went early on a Tuesday night prior to a show at RTH and it was surprisingly busy but it was not so noisy that we could not hear each other as is so often the case in Toronto restaurants.  A BIG thumbs up for that.
Our waiter was really nice and seemed to really enjoy working there but seemed to disappear at the end of the meal...this could go either way as I did appreciate that he did not rush us when he saw that we were having a conversation despite the fact that there was a line of people waiting.... but on the other hand we had to flag down another waiter to ask for our bill.
The food was solid and truly tasty but I would not rate it as fantastic but, in a market where I have been to restaurants that had fantastic meals one time and meh the next I am definitely happier with consistently solid tasty food.  When I come here I know I am going to have a good meal and be served by happy servers so Thank You for being a place that I know I can come and have a reasonably priced truly enjoyable meal.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James A.,"I came here on a Friday evening. The dining area was very busy and had a great atmosphere. The service was good. I ordered the coconut curry in a coconut. The presentation was great and the curry was also great. A little bit pricy, but I was overall very happy with my visit and would visit again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mylène R.,"This is by far the best Thai restaurant I've ever been! Everything was fantastic! Tried the deep fried squash to start followed by the egg noodle curry! Everything tastes fresh and is super flavourful! Everyone needs to try it. My husband has the Pad Thai, which was also very good. The service we good. We did wait 45 minutes for a table, but it was worth the wait. Very busy place which tells me it's a great restaurant.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Afzal H.,"Great northern Thai food. Not all ""authentic"", there's some fusion stuff. But speaking from the perspective of someone that lived in Thailand for almost a decade, I think the food is an excellent window into Thai flavours.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rupa S.,"Love the flavour, the food, but hate the wait for this amazing food!
No question Pai is amazing. I've tried a few dishes here, I love the khao soi, spicy and flavourful. It's this curry soup with crunchy noodles. Seriously good! You can adjust the spice level to your preference.  The pad Thai is a safe bet, and also very good. The prices and portion sizes are great. It really Tastes authentic!
The Thai ice tea here is great. I get it every times
The place is popular so be prepared to wait. You definitely can't find this food out in the suburbs.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica T.,"Take out review. 
Ordered the shrimp khao soi, Tom yum soup and Thai milk iced tea. $30 total. 
Thai iced milk tea was AMAZING. 
Food quality was good, although personally found everything to be too overwhelming. Khao soi tasted amazing but the soup base begins to taste like a really intense curry sauce after a while, could not finish it as it was too overwhelming and a little sickening to be honest. 
I had to water down the tom yum soup as it was just too intense as well! 
I would still come again and try other things on the menu!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Breanne W.,"I have now been to Pai three times because the first time I went just wasn't enough. Went night one and ordered a cool mule and loved it so much I ordered the ingredients so I can make my own at home in Ottawa. The pad gra prow is SO good - definitely recommend getting the beef and their green curry is probably the most authentic I have had since being in Thailand. The food is fantastic, the service is great and the atmosphere is one of the best. The place is busy and just keeps going further as you walk around corners. I have never had to wait very long for a table though and they have a cute little stand up bar area so you can order drinks while you wait. I highly recommend checking it out!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen D.,"Tell your mom, tell your dad. Pai is where it's at. Masaman or get out. Monster beers left and right. Don't kid yourself. This is the real deal. Chicken wings are serious good.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,S R.,"UberEATS Dinner: Pad Thai, golden curry with noodles and green curry.
Value, taste, service: 4/5
Notes: Perhaps a bit overhyped. Fave southeast Asian place is still gourmet Malaysia",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alec W.,"Pai Northern Kitchen is a great restaurant, but like many BlogTO darlings, the sheer volume of traffic they get makes life a bit worse for diners and staff alike. Be prepared to be faced with a lineup at Pai, I would recommend visiting at odd hours if you are a tourist or eating out on the weekend. The food is excellent, especially the Khao Soi, and you are hard pressed to find better Thai food (have to go to Sai Lom at Church/Wellesley). All in all, if you know what you are getting in to, you will have a good time.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eric T.,"This is my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. I ordered the chicken pad Thai and it delicious! It has just the right amount of flavouring! The sauce wasn't overpowering
and tasted good with the noodles. I also ordered the stringed squash appetizer that was very crispy and flavourful.  The service was very friendly even thought it was busy the times that I went! I would definitely go again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley A.,"So we went back. This time for dinner. We ordered the chicken wings to start. They were soooooo good!! So we ordered some more! Then for the mains we ordered the (medium spicy) pad gra prow with shrimp which is basically grilled shrimp in a basil and oyster sauce on rice, and the khao plan tawt which is a plate of crispy whitefish filets with rice and a couple sauces. 
The fish dish is similar to the Fried Fish with Green Curry Sauce on the lunch menu. The dinner version comes with a chili sauce and a tamarind sauce while the lunch version comes with a curry sauce.
I loved the wings and the shrimp in basil & oyster sauce! So much so that I'm upgrading this place from 4 stars to 5.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennie L.,"I love this place! I came here with a few friends, and we ordered the spring rolls and 4 main dishes. Everything on the menu looks amazing, and we had such a hard time deciding what to get. In the end, we managed to narrow down our choices, and everything that came was absolutely delicious! My favorites were the Spring Rolls and Pad Thai. The Gaeng Kiaw Wan gets bonus points for presentation, as it came in a cute little coconut. I can't wait to come back and try the other dishes! As I watched the waiters/waitresses pass by with other tables' orders, everything looked so good!
I would recommend making reservations or coming early, as the place gets packed quickly and the lines get long. I came on a Saturday night with a group of 5. We arrived just before 6pm, and were seated right away. About 5 mins after we sat down, I saw a line start to form at the entrance.
I loved the the street-vibe feel of the place, and thought it was a great place to hang out and catch up with friends. However, the place does get pretty crowded, and the tables are mostly pretty close together, so it can get a bit loud.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bhavik V.,"One of the top 3 Thai restaurant in Toronto. The atmosphere makes you feel like you've actually entered a Thai kitchen. The food is flavourful and sized well. As a vegetarian, I was able to enjoy the many options available!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yannick J.,"Clearly a place to go if you like Thai food.
Just walked in without reservation and was provided with a time-slot that was incredibly accurate. The place was packed but there was a great atmosphere. The food was delicious and the service friendly and professional.
Price was very reasonable.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle C.,"Best Thai place I have ever eaten at in Toronto. 
Get the Thai mule drink - amazing 
Wanting - lineups are usually really long. 
Leave yourself lots of time to wait for a table. The wait is 100% worth it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Terry W.,"Eat the Khao Soi! It's life changing.  The place is a little bit loud, somewhat chaotic, and it all feels so authentically Thai.  The food is fantastic.  It's worth the wait for a table, or also, just order it on Uber eats!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Virginia U.,"Love love love this place the staff is really friendly and the food is AMAZING... I'm not giving 5 stars because the waitress made a mistake on our bill, but as soon as we let her know she quickly fix it.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Morgan B.,This place popped off. The food was fire and the atmosphere was enticing.  A bit noisy but the waitstaff was pleasant. Would definitely recommend!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cynthia A.,Great service and even better food! Highly recommended spot for any lovers of Thai food.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura L.,"Came here on a thursday night around 6pm. As expected, it was super packed. Waited for about 45min. I recommend getting the squash fries and the northern market rice pork dish. I loved it. I've never been to Thailand, nor am i Thai, so not sure if this is real real thai food, but it tasted super amazing!! I guarantee you'll feel full after this, you might not even be able to finish. If you can reserve, please do!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melissa F.,"Great versions of Thai food. a little pricey- but this is my go-to when I want ""fancy thai"".
Delivery available-starts at 5pm. well packaged although food comes less than hot.
Go ahead and do ""foreigner spicy"" or ""thai spicy""- medium was nothing for me and i love spice.
Much better than Khao sao road for me. Literally ate these back to back and hands down, KSR is getting sloppy and Pai remains good quality.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mindy X.,Ambiance was 5/5. Actual food wasn't spectacular. I tried the khao soi and portion was typical.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kendra M.,"Service, bomb.
People, bomb.
Food, life changing. I don't ever say the food is life changing but let me tell you,I was blown away. The flavours made me tear up. (I am a flavour lover)
I'll be back here again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah Y.,"Always forget to make reservations. 
But food is great, and service is good too.
Definitely recommend the coconut curry in the coconut + Thai iced tea.
Nom x 10",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gina M.,Some of the best Thai food that I've ever had. Pai turned my boyfriend onto Thai food being this was his first time having Thai. Tucked into neighborhood in downtown Toronto it was well worth the wait. Even though it was a longer wait the service was really quick when we did get seated.  I always come here anytime I'm visiting Toronto !,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dustin K.,"It has great ambiance with pub feeling. We took reservation but still, we need to wait for the table. However, the food is absolutely amazing! The yellow curry lamb is an absolutely great choice.
In general, the food deserves the great rating, but the wait time and the noise level cost 1 star.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thuy H.,"The food here is amazing. I went here on a date and we had to wait over an hour for a table, not something I personally like doing, but it speaks to how much people love the food here. 
We had the Miang Kung appetizer, which came with a lot of fresh ingredients and you wrap them with shrimp and betel leaves and dip in a tamarind sauce - it was refreshing, delicious and very satisfying. The best dish we had that night.
The green curry and khao soi were also delicious. I would definitely go here often if the wait is shorter. I had food from here delivered before and it just isn't the same as when you eat at the restaurant. Please expand your restaurant Pai :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex L.,"Oh Pai, why do you make me keep coming back?  This Thai staple in the downtown core is my go to for both after work dinner with friends as well as lunches with the team.
The menu is classic Thai, with the green curry being spot on.  In the evenings, it is served inside a coconut, which is so tender that you could scoop out the flesh inside and add it to your curry.  On another occasion I had the Penang beef, which was bracingly spicy, with a more hearty taste in the beef.  Hot tip: always get the Thai iced tea.
There's also a secret room at the back with a TV that can be reserved for corporate events and large gatherings as well.  A good mix of work and play I'd say.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Seth O.,"I honestly can't remember having a better meal than this Pad Thai and my says the same about the Khao Soi. The line to get a table was out the door but from the time we got in line to when we got sat couldn't have been more than 30 minutes. We ordered a Thai mojito and a plum Moscow mule while we waited and they were delicious. Once we got to the table we ordered the sake bombs which really set the night off right. I can't express enough how delicious the food was and how lively the ambiance was. If you're second guessing waiting in that line, don't. There's a reason it's so packed. The staff was so nice and extremely efficient. We were visiting all the way from Texas and when we go back we'll definitely go try another dish from this place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Salim S.,"Some of the best Pad Thai I've ever had, plus a fantastic curry. The menu is a bit limited so you won't see things like Pad See Ew and the chicken skewer appetizers were disappointing but generally a fantastic experience.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marie W.,"Cool atmosphere, good energy,... and the food was fantastic too. I don't remember the name of the dish but it had a milky curry sauce that was sooooo delicious I wanted to just drink it (yes, I held myself back).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sume D.,"MAKE. RESERVATIONS. 
Seriously. 
Pai does take walk-ins but believe me you want to make those reservations. Finally got to eat here on a Friday night. My friend and I decided to take a chance and grab a meal here before catching a movie. We get here for 6:30 and the line is out the door so we give our names and grab drinks at the bar. The place is jam packed so the wait was about 30 mins for a table for two. We get seated and our server is super friendly and helpful when recommending dishes.  We decided on the Khao Soi with chicken which tastes like heaven(!!), and Massaman curry with tender pieces of beef. 
We had about an hour to order, eat and head out for our movie. Seeing how busy it was I was little concerned that we might not get our food quick enough. However, our server totally had our back, we got the food pretty quickly and honestly it didn't take us long to inhale the food, or pay the bill which came to $50 for two people. Not bad!
I will definitely return but probably not when I'm on a deadline to eat. If you've never been here get the Khao Soi, dare I say it but it might actually be better than Khao San's.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen H.,"This place is great! I loved the vibe and food.
Staff: They were really attentive at clearing away dishes. Offered us great suggestions as to their most popular dishes.
Ambience: It's definitely got a street-vibe and I was totally digging it. There's plenty of space but don't expect any luxurious seating. It was pretty loud but I'm used to places like that.
Food: I had the Gai Satay which were basically chicken skewers and they were so delicious! I know they're just skewers but the chicken was so tender and juicy and just melted off with flavour. For my main, I decided to see their version of a dish a commonly order, Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Chicken. It was not the best Pad Thai I've ever had, but it was still good. I think next time I'll opt to try one of their curries though (I had a taste of my friends' and they were all very tasty).
Two thumbs up!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dawn B.,The food here is amazing! The Grabong (butternut squash fritters) was sooo good! All the food we had was well seasoned. Our first night in Toronto was delicious!! Worth the wait for sure.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie C.,"With so many great reviews, I had to try this spot out for myself!! 
I love the atmosphere of this place, very relaxed and comfortable! 
My go-to when visiting 98% of Thai restaurants is pad Thai, so I ordered the veggie pad Thai and wow was it good!! 
Perfectly cooked tofu, flavourful sauce and an abundance of delicious veggies.
It was a massive portion, but I still managed to finish it all because it was so good!! 
I also got the 'Summer Dog' cocktail and it was great! The lychee paired with peach schnapps was a perfect combination. 
Don't miss this Thai place ... Definitely one of my new favourites!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Neha S.,I have heard so much about this restaurant. It is supposed to be the best thai place in Toronto and after ordering the pad thai with tofu and grabong I understood why. The food was delicious with decent portions and good service.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leonard N.,Pai has some of the best Thai food in the city. Their pad Thai and oxtail curry are pretty amazing.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sapna M.,"Food and drink: One of my favourite places for vegetarian spring rolls in the city - the mushrooms add a unique and hearty flavour. Pad thai (tofu & veggie) is good but not as authentic as some other restaurants (like SukhoThai). They also have good beer and drink selections.
Atmosphere: Fun and bustling! Can get quite busy though so be prepared for a wait if you don't have a reso.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sanjay J.,"Very very overrated. 
My coworkers recommended the place and I walked there to see a 1 hour wait. I didn't want to wait in the cold so I left. Came back again the next week and saw the same thing. Now I absolutely had to try them out!
I went there slightly early and after a 30 minute wait, got a seat at the bar area next to 2 others. The food and drink were average, the place was small and noisy. Not a good experience.
Never went back since.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Himanshu W.,"This is a wonderful place to go to. Amazing food. The food never disappoints. Be ready for a long wait time though (almost always). It's understandable at such a busy restaurant but the service is quite slow, and we had to wait for a long time to get a refill on our waters. Other than that, the food and ambience is just amazing. Would definitely recommend.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennie Z.,"I would rate pai to be the number one Thai restaurant in Toronto,
Decorating: Street Thai feeling 
Food: great taste, great portion 
Only downside: too popular that you will need to stand in line.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexis J.,"I was in Toronto to celebrate Caribana and this place was just a 5-min walk from my hotel. I loved it. Great drinks, and flavorful food. I ordered a yellow curry dish with chicken. It was just the right amount of food to fill you up, without stuffing you to the brim. The atmosphere is lively, although a bit dim. Just fair warning, this place gets PACKED during happy hour and evenings. When we arrived, there were several open tables....but when we left!?...A line out the door!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jordan V.,"THE GOAT!!
The Greatest of all Thais!!!
I've been to other Thai restaurants and nothing compares to this place. Pai is the number one Thai restaurant in Toronto, hands down the best. If you'd compare this place to a basketball player, this place is the Michael Jordan of Thai restaurants. I've tried every single dish they have on their menu and every dish is a 10/10. Whoever gave this place a bad rating, I'm sorry but your taste buds are not working properly.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina L.,"Great food, great service, great location, but very long lines.
Notable mentions include the pad thai, khao soi, thai milk tea, and mango sticky rice. There's a Pai Market at the back, where you can purchase some goods. Will definitely be back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Monika C.,Waited in line for 45 minutes and was worth every second. I got the Pad Thai and it was beyond expectations. I would completely recommend this place- great thai food,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Claudio D.,"Overall i expected more from all the other highly rated reviews. The atmosphere is great, however when is cold i suggest sitting away from the door as it gets pretty chilly. The food portions were rather small, the thai tea ice cream for dessert was delicious. Prices are reasonable. Service not so great or friendly",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Faye F.,"We were here last night, catching up with some old friends!  The ambience is casual and this place was totally busy.  I recommend making a reservation (which they accept)  Woot!
We had the spring rolls, squash fritters and morning glory? (a fabulously delicious green vegetable dish) to start, they were all fantastic.
I ordered Phad Sol?  I should take pictures of the menu.  It was a rice noodle dish in yellow curry and totally delicious.
I can't wait to come back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maggie H.,"Decent portion. $15 -$18 main dishes. There's always a line up but we opt out of the alcohol section and got a table in 5 min, even tho they told us 20 min. Great ambiance, crab salad came with pork rinds and shrimp chips; my oxtail (odd thing to get at a Thai restaurant) was full of flavour and melted right off the bone.
Pai is officially going on the roster.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ja K.,"Anytime I try a new Thai place, the first thing I try is phad Thai with pork. It's a basic dish, so if a Thai place can't handle this simple dish, that tells me how good of a restaurant they are. This place has excellent phad Thai! Its green curry is pretty tasty as well, and served in a cocount shell appears to be perhaps the most popular dish served. It's located in a basement and relatively small, so expect a 30+ minute wait. At least while I was there they had some old school hip-hop for music, which I found enjoyable.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tere F.,"It is the BEST Thai restaurant that I have tried in months.... I was shocked! Normally people doesn't suggest me any good restaurant... but this was incredible!
Waiting:
You have to wait between 45 to 50 minutes but believe me... it worth it! Make a reservation if you don't like to wait. They have a pretty cool system to do that. 
Food:
The Spring Rolls are amazing!! The Gaeng Kiaw Wan, or like I called it: The Coconut Curry is magical... it comes with perfect jasmine rice.
Staff:
They are GREAT!
I've been there twice, and I really want to go back right now!
Try it... You'll not regreat it",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anjali S.,Great food but I wish they would scrape the meat out of the coconut before serving the green curry in it. Seems like a horrible waste especially since coconuts are not very eco friendly to grow in the first place,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria D.,"I'm writing my review based on the food, and not the service I received (i will explain further in).
I ordered the tom yum Kung, i love tom yum flavoured everything, so I was excited to try this for my first time at Pai. I loved the soup, it came out over a candle to keep it hot, served with a side of rice. It came with two jumbo shrimp and some onions and mushrooms. You can definitely taste the fish sauce, which I love in Asian cuisines. It was definitely a cozy and super tasty dish. 
However, I was very disappointed in the service we received from our waitress, and am very displeased to say that the kitchen staff who brought out our food was far more helpful than our actual waitress. We were seated and were waiting for one friend, but we knew what they wanted, so we waited for our waitress to come around to at least order our drinks, but she didnt for 15 mins and we had to flag her down, which she did not seem happy about. My boyfriend had asked her what was on tap, and she rudely replied with ""What?"" along with a displeased look. After ordering our drinks, she went off when we wanted to order our food as well, so we gave her a few minutes to punch in orders, tend other tables. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes and had to flag her down again, still seemed unhappy with asking her to take our order. When my friend had noted that he had a peanut allergy and asked if there was any nuts in his dishes, she once again seemed displeased to be asked a question. It took about 20 minutes to receive our food, and some of it was cold, where as the table behind us who had sat down and order after us began receiving their food within 5 minutes of ordering. Not even once during our meal did she ask if our meal was okay or if we wanted more water, we actually had to ask a different staff member to help us out. 
Another thing I kind of found work inappropriate was what one of the servers was wearing (btw I am in no way shaming this server or have any problems with what she was wearing but in no way do I or many others find it workplace appropriate in a restaurant for families...) but she was wearing a VERY sheer top, without anything under and you could clearly see her nipples, mind you I'm ok with that, but I'm not so sure families with younger children would be okay with that. 
In the end, we received our bill from our waitress, who yet once again seemed so annoyed with us, we saw that we had a 20% service charge. I'm okay with paying a service charge, since we did have 6 people, but I don't really think that our server deserved the 20% since her coworkers were waiting our table for her. 
Overall, the food is pretty good, a little bit on the pricier side for the portion you receive but the quality is there, but I don't mind as there aren't many good Thai restaurants in Toronto. i loved the atmosphere and vibe they had going on. Honestly, the service we received was definitely subpar, but i am willing to give them another chance because everyone does have their off day, just hoping to be served by a different waitress next time.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jasmine A.,"Food: 5/5
Atmosphere: 5/5
Service: 4.5/5
One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Great for groups, but make reservations. Been here many times, for dinner and lunch. 
Must Try:
Green Curry Rice: My favourite thing on the menu just because I love curry and the bamboo shoots.
Mango Sticky rice: it's seasonal, I haven't had any luck the past few times I've been. 
Thai Bucket: a big bucket of alcohol, great for sharing. Just something fun to have with friends.
Grabong (Fried battered squash fritters): Definitely something to share with friends, it's a little on the sweet side, but I couldn't stop eating them. Anything fried is pretty good to me. 
Ox tail: Very flavourful and saucy, a little too sweet for me, but I'm not one with a sweet tooth.
Khao Soi: Served with egg noodles, which I didn't prefer as much, but still delicious.
Atmosphere: Loud, but fun. 
Service: If we get seated in the corner, or that little area on the left, sometimes it is a little hard for us to flag down a waitress to order, or even to get our glasses of water refilled. Most of the time I'm there, I'm not in a rush, so I didn't mind.
Definitely will go back again...and again..and again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeffrey Z.,"Very long wait time, extremely noisy. I ordered a chicken Khao Soi and the meat was cold when my food came out. Very disappointed",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wang L.,"It was the longest waiting time for me to wait for a dinner EVER!! Me and my friends came to the pub or ordered at 715pm but wait until 815pm to serve!!!! TO be honestly, the food there is very good, 5/5. But just the waiting time!! Maybe they Are short of waiters..",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen P.,Hands down the best Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto. Portions are on the smaller side but very tasty!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria S.,Had the Kao Soi ..... it was so good. From what I've heard it's the best in the city and I wouldn't argue with that!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,N B.,"Top quality, consistently. One of the best three Thai restaurants in Toronto. Absolutely delicious & authentic food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rob Z.,Probably one of the best Thai restaurants in the city (alongside Khao San Road). Fiancee usually gets he pad thai which is delicious. I almost always get the panang curry as I thunk they do an incredible job with the flavours without being too overwhelming. I have tried the other curries but still always go back to the panang curry. Try to get there early as they fill up quick for lunch and dinner.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shirley C.,"Finally had the opportunity to give it a try last week, we went right when they open, luckily we went so early... shortly after we order the line up begins.
The restaurant definitely brings back the memory of Bangkok street eats, it was very lively at a comfortable level.
A few of us got three types of curries... all was amazing! Except the green curry, as the bamboo shoot overpowered the whole dish. 
Tried the Thai tea cocktail... not a fan! Tasted more like coffee, regular Thai tea is good but a bit too heavy, I think Basil Box has a lighter but more frequent Thai tea 
Overall, will definitely return if I feel authentic Thai eats, but it is on the heavier side",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mi S.,"Expect to wait long if your not here before 5:30pm. The line up for this place is massive and sometimes out the door. The location is in a basement which also makes it a bit hot down there. The food and vibe is great ... very relaxed and chill. The staff and service is friendly and they are quick to help. Our waiter was a great efficient guy. Forgot his name though. We ordered the Kao Soi, Fried pumpkin fries, Pad thai, Curry Chicken and a bowl of white rice. Oh and don't forget to order the Mango smoothie or the Thai Ice Tea! To die for. All the flavors are so strong and flavorful, I love it.   Just please remember to arrive before 5:30 (this applies to all week long) because of the long line up.  Since we arrived at 6:00pm, we waited about 30 minutes for a table. But if you arrive even later around 7pm, good luck getting a table.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dhruvi B.,Been here few times and love their food. The spice level is amazing. Their red and green curry is to die for! Also their Thai iced tea. The restaurant is usually pretty busy and don't take reservations but they have a small bar and once you check in they give you a buzzer so you can grab drinks while waiting.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sinan S.,"The food teaste really good. Just the set is not that comfortable, abd servise a little bit slow. I believe you will like there",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John S.,"Came to Toronto for the weekend to do some sight seeing and eat.  I was with some friends, two of which were from Thailand.  We live in Chicago and can tell you that my friends tell me all the time that there's no really good place to get Thai food in Chicago. They really liked this place compared to anything in Chicago as far as Thai food is concerned.  I've eaten their home cooked meals which are phenomenal and can say that this place was on point.  We shared every one of their appetizers between our party of six and all of them were good.  Only issue is we ate so many appetizers that I couldn't finish my main dish which was exceptional as well. Couldn't take it back to the hotel so it's sad that I didn't get to finish it but would highly recommend this place to anyone.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amani L.,The deep fried coconut shrimp appetizer is really really good! This place is a bit pricey but the food and quality of food is pretty great...,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ludivine L.,"Great spot - friendly people and wonderful food.  I go frequently, and have never been disappointed.  Interesting menu, too.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Virginia M.,Unbelievable food. I love Thai food and I've eaten a lot of it and this is hands down the best thai place I've ever been. I got the green curry with chicken which came in a coconut (so cute) but also came with an extra bowl of curry on the side so they definitely didn't skimp. It was sooooo good. The service was good and it was a little loud but I liked the whole environment/vibe as a whole. A super cool ambience. Some people on here have complained about the wait but we went at like 7:30 on a Monday so we didn't have that problem although it was still pretty busy. 10/10 would recommend,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raffael S.,"I went here as it was highly recommend by severeal independent sources. I assume it is very well known as we had to wait 40 min for a table on a Monday. However, that was ok as they have a nice waiting area.
Eventually we ordered food but had to wait 30min for it to arrive.
The food in my case a soup was cold. The rice that came with it already had formed this crust on top that it does when you let it stand around for a while.
I can't recommend this place at all.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joyce L.,"I really really LOVE Thai food, and this place is THE place to be when you want authentic Thai food!
First off, this place is always packed! ALWAYS! They use to take your cell phone number down and they would text you to notify you if your table is ready but just recently they've change that. You can't leave the premise anymore instead they will give you a buzzer which is so inconvenient. 
The service is kind and friendly, the place is huge which I've discovered only recently. There's more seating all the way to the right and back! It's pretty squished though. I had to stand up a couple of times to let people pass.
The service is pretty fast and friendly, the food is A1! I highly recommend trying their squash Fritters to start, super crispy and I can't stop munching on it! And obviously sip on their infamous Thai Iced Tea. For the mains: you must try their PAD THAI! obviously. The flavours are just sooo tasty, their portion is super huge, I never finish it. Also please try their Pork Pad Gra Prow, and their oxtail! The flavours are indescribably Amazing! 
I suggest coming right when they open but if you don't mind waiting then there's a bar in the waiting area, and as far as I'm aware you can also grab food and apps while you wait! 
I've been here wayyy too many times to count, I enjoy it every single time!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Beth D.,"The shrimp chips came with a yummy tamarind sauce, the holy basil chicken was delish, and the sauv blanc was a perfect bottle to share over this yummy thai food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristy N.,"I feel like most people who gave Pai amazing ratings came where there wasn't as HUGE of a lineup. Was the food great? Yes, it was really delicious - more to come later in the review. Was the service good when we sat at the tables? Yes I would say it was standard! Why three stars then, you might ask? WELL, the story goes:
We came here for a weekday dinner on a very cold Toronto night, and let me tell you, the lineup to put our names down took 30 minutes. Yes, there was a line that went ALL around the staircase, and yes, there was a lot of awkwardness with us and other first-timers wanting to get a number and realizing that we had to lineup AROUND the whole staircase to get a number. No, no, we're not  trying to bud in line, it's just that I've never seen a host take THAT long to take people's names down. Literally, all we were asked is ""How many people in your party? What's your name? It will be an X minute wait, okay?"" THREE QUESTIONS, and it took them 5 minutes to ask those questions cause the servers had to discuss a table problem with the host. I really hope the organization of Pai steps up. I really don't mind waiting for an hour for a table, but to wait 30 minutes to put down our names when there were roughly 10 parties in front of us waiting to put their names down is a little TOO long.
Loved the little waiting area for people especially when the weather is so cold! When you're waiting, you're able to order some drinks and when you're buzzer rings, you're ready to go! If they really wanted to fit tables in this room, I think they could put maybe 10-15 parties of 2-4 in here, but it's also a good idea for people to have a space to wait. 
Since one of our friends came here before, we knew EXACTLY what to order. There are five levels of spice for the mains you can order, ranging from no spice at all to Thai level spicy! We ordered the Grabong, Chef Nuit Pad Thai, Gaeng Masaman with braised beef, and Pad Gra Prow. 
To start off for drinks, we got heir Thai ice tea ($5.50) which was REALLY good. Despite the large amount of ice in here, the taste was really good until the ice started melting. 
Grabong ($13) - Description: Freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters lightly coated in red curry paste batter, deep fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with nuts. (contains eggs and peanuts)
This was honestly one of my favourites! These squash fritters were delicious - you really have to eat a few in one bite!!! They're much tastier than sweet potato fries in my opinion, but if I had to compare them to something, it would be like thinly cut sweet potato fries, made into a fritter with some scrumptious sauce for dipping. 
Chef Nuit Pad Thai ($15.50) - Description: Stir fried rice noodle in a home made tamarind sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts. Choice of Chicken, Beef or tofu and veggies. (contains oyster sauce).
This pad thai was good, but it wasn't like a DROP DEAD amazing kind of good. They did pretty well in making the levels of spiciness though as five very different levels!
Gaeng Masaman with braised beef ($15) - Description: Braised beef in a peanut, tamarind curry with potatoes and topped with deep fried crispy shallots. (contains shrimp paste) Served with steamed jasmine rice.
This dish tasted fairly delicious too. I wasn't a big fan of the braised beef, it wasn't as tender as I wanted it to be, but it wasn't necessarily chewy either. The sauce was good, but it also wasn't my top pick!
Pad Gra Prow ($15.50) - Description: Holy basil stir fried with your choice of ground Pork, Chicken, Beef or Tofu served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a thai style fried egg. (contains oyster sauce) Served with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime)
This might have been my faourite dish. Except I wish they gave MORE RICE. We ordered an extra bowl of rice cause the sauce was THAT good. I wish I can bring the secret recipe for this dish home.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rica J.,"Omg...you have to try this place! Thank god for yelp, without it we wouldn't have went to this place. The food is the most authentic thai food I've had this far. The service was great, very friendly staff and the place was packed already at 5pm on a Saturday.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Charlie P.,"Best Thai food in toronto - hands down! Love the atmosphere, food, and drinks. Great service too!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marc O.,"This is my favourite Thai food in the city. Have had almost their entire menu and haven't disliked anything. Their lunch hour ""curry in a hurry"" is really good and you can get it after 1 for 1/2 price using feedback or ritual.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dun H.,"Best in town.
Must make a reservation one day in ahead if you want to go in a busy time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maria L.,"Best Thai food in Toronto. Pai is truly worth the wait, they don't take same day reservations. 
My favourite appetizers include the grabong and spring rolls. For main, I usually either get the green curry, khao soi, or pad thai.....with that being said, you truly can't go wrong with any of the menu items. 
Service is always amazing, friendly and attentive staff, good food, and a great dining atmosphere... what else could you want within a restaurant experience?!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bryan H.,"This place is bomb!
I tried the pad Thai, the massamon(idk how to spell it) and green curry.
Service: poor.  My friend asked to change the meat after she ordered it.  The lady was kind of pissed and said she would try.  Not the part I was pissed about.  I was more angry that she never came back with a confirmation about the meat change.  They did end up changing it for us which was nice I guess.
Food:
Masamoon: so damn good.  It's like this tamarind curry that matched really well with the beef.  I tried this dish at khao San road and that was way to sour
Green curry: amazing. Came in this coconut that you could eat.  Was amazing
Pad Thai:  the only dish that was meh still better than most pad Thai's tho
Tom yum soup:  was better than most places at all
Notes:  make reservations, service isn't the greatest, food is awesome",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arna Lewis W.,"Feel like I am back home in Northern Thailand eating Northern Thai Food. Taste just like home. This is not just a regular Thai restaurant. The atmosphere, the food, the staff were excellent.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Allen R.,"Pai was phenomenal. The tom yum soup was out of this world. I had the green curry in a coconut, which was tasty and light. My girlfriend had the pad thai, which was flavorful. Prices are not bad either (around 50 for the entire meal, very full by the end, and had leftovers). Service was great! Highly highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wenny H.,You won't know this hidden gem if just walk on the street. We found it through Yelp. It's massive inside and service is fast. Food is amazingly good. We find real authentic Thai food here and loved every dish!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Billy P.,"The review is based on eating in and take-out.
My first experience at Pai was when I had a take out of their Khao Soi with beef. Had to line up to pay for the food which is disappointing as you just have to watch your food get cold. When I opened the plastic container at home, I found extremely firm, wavy (very short wave length). It was simply very uncooked. The fried noodle was softer than the egg noodle once soaked in curry. The curry itself was creamy and nice but it would obviously would never stick to the hard noodle. I was extremely disappointed after reading such good reviews. So do not get takeout for noodles. Do not risk it.
However, when my friends came from the states, I decided to give this place another try. Ordered green curry and khao soi with beef. Green curry in coconut was really amazing. It was smooth and had such great depth of flavor rather than just being sweet as is from many thai restaurants. Khao soi turned out to be a completely different dish with the cooked noodle. The thick creamy oily curry was perfect for the egg noodles. It was really good with my leftover rice from green curry as well. Sangria was sangria. 
So always eat in if you want noodles. Otherwise, you will be happy.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fiona L.,"I love pad thai and have had it from different restaurants in the city. But none are as flavourful as at this restaurant. It was like a flavour explosion in my mouth. I can see why this place is so busy. 
The service was pretty good as well and the layout is fun. The high stools where we sat were a bit uncomfortable though.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tanveer K.,The food was good but I found a glass in my massaman beef curry and I left my jacket and I called pai they didn't really care about my concern and they hung up if this type of service the person on the phone was female she was really rude and she hung up worst service ever,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Crsie K.,"The papaya salad is really interesting where you have to mix all the ingredients yourself. It was pretty delicious -- not the typical papaya salad.
The Khao Soi curry is tasty but the noodles were a bit over cooked. Think I could've gone without it. 
The green curry has a nice presentation to it bc it came in a fresh coconut so we could eat the coconut skins which was a nice balance to the flavors.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jean C.,"Long wait, good food but nothing crazy, average to below average service. I won't go back to this place.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sebastian W.,"Food Quality - Great
Menu Design - Good - mostly the same
Service - Fine
Decor - Fine, but unique
Location - Hidden, but good
Price - Fair
Best/second best Thai in the city.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren K.,"Such good fried rice! And the potato fritters. For sure will be coming back.
The atmosphere is a little dark and loud, but nothing that ruined the dinner conversation.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kaiwen Z.,5/5 for sure. Everything was awesome! Love their Thai iced tea. Expect a long wait on weekends.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thomas M.,"This place was amazing. The vibe was awesome. I lived in Thailand for a while and this is LEGIT Thai food. If you are looking for really good Thai food this is the place you have to go. It is legit, filling, and cheap for the amount and the legitness of the food. If you are visiting Toronto this is a MUST COME place to eat.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Abhi V.,"Okay so let me start by saying I've been a loyal customer at Pai for over a year now. I pick up lunch from here at least once every two weeks. I always get the green curry because it is literally perfection! The vegetables, chicken, spice, every element of this dish is amazing. 
BUT they changed the recipe!!  The last two times I picked up lunch from Pai the green curry was missing the fig-looking and pea-looking vegetables! I am so devastated and disappointed because the price didn't change but the quality did. It really is a shame.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily H.,"probably THE best thai place in Toronto (this spot used to be held by salad king, but after the fire and remodel, it is not the same), loved all the dishes here! Must try the mango sticky rice!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alon G.,"I don't think I can say more than what's already been said. The food is yummy, quick and not very expensive. The staff are cool and polite and the place really reminds me of Thailand (when I was there about 5 years ago). Last time I was there, I ate at the bar and chatted with the bartender. He was really cool. 
Warning: this place gets super packed and the wait can be long, eventhough there is a quick customer turn-over. Still worth the wait (eat at the bar).",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Colin M.,"THese niggas really know how to cook the ching chong mix G, also i think i was on fire my G",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Corey T.,"Excellent food, cocktails, vibe. Extremely popular spot, but if not in need of a table, I highly recommend sitting at one of the two bars and jumping the massive queue. Of all the items on the menu, I'm going to highlight the Thai Beef Salad. Get it as an app for a few people or have it + a smaller dish as your meal. Tender and so tasty - seasoned perfectly and not too much dressing (as happens sometimes). Service was attentive and music had great presence without being too loud. Great spot.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nancy G.,"Amazing food, great service and wicked atmosphere. Always a hit, every time I come! 
Tip: book reservations 1 month in advance !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aileen C.,Good is always amazing and authentic here. Service is also good but it is Always busy so be prepared to wait in line. Prob the best Thai food I've had in Toronto. Prices are a little on the higher side. Great ambience.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy P.,AMAZING authentic Thai food!  Wow!!! as a traveler it was such a pleasant surprise to find great authentic food and vibrant happy noises around ya after a tiring day of being tourists. We loved everything and could not stop raving about the chicken wings! Best ever!!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edward C.,"Went there last year but I forgot to make a review.
The place is kind of grungy but it reminded me of the night life of the North Gate Jazz Bar in Chiang Mai.  The Khao Soi was actually better than the Khao Soi that I had in Thailand.  They also sell Tiger Beer which is a great plus.
10/10 would dine again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bradley C.,"one of my fave spots in the city.  Its ALWAYS packed, so try and reserve or go early/leave your info.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel B.,"Went to Pai!
It was bustling, busy. Super fun!
We ordered:
Pad Thai!!!!!
Servie: I could tell its new restaurant and things are being worked out, but Service was super courteous, sweet and warm. 
Overal: recommend, great addition to neighbourhood.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Frances C.,"If I could only eat one cuisine for the rest of my life, it'd be Thai food. And with Khao San Road closed for renovation and Pai just a couple blocks from my home, this is definitely a place I frequent regularly. 
There's often a line-up, but they recently expanded so the last few times I haven't had to wait, which is great! It's a very casual, energetic vibe and can be quite noisy during busy times, but I don't mind. The service is okay. Not super attentive and sometimes slow, but I know, they're busy, so it's fine. The servers are friendly enough.
I can't say anything bad about their Pad Thai - I order it every time. It's probably my favourite Pad Thai in Toronto. The Chiang mai beef noodle soup is great as well. The soup is flavourful with spices and the beef is nice and tender. It's never piping hot though. Same with the tom yum soup with shrimp - it's not steaming hot when it comes out (even though it comes in a metal pot with a candle underneath to keep it warm). But it's delicious.
I do wish that Pai had a red or panang curry - curry is my love. They do have a green curry served in a coconut, which is okay but not my favourite. I find the coconut to be a bit gimmicky and I don't really like when I stick my spoon in the coconut and end up scraping off a chunk of coconut meat. I do LOVE their massaman curry, though - the beef and potato chunks are tender and the gravy is delicious. The curry comes with a bowl of rice, which is the perfect vehicle for consuming all of the gravy.
I feel happy and satisfied every time I eat here. Always a good experience!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lily N.,"Love this place! I generally don't like the Thai food in Toronto, but this place is legit!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacklyn N.,The consistently long lines and amazing fresh and flavourful food speak for themselves! The food never disappoints and offers something different than the menu at a typical Thai place.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jon D.,"Been here a few times and they are always busy. If you are in the area, this is the best choice. 
Every dish I have tried has been awesome. You really can't go wrong. If you are into Thai food, this is a must visit place. 
Try the thai iced tea. There is nothing quite like it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danae C.,"Had very high expectations because of the reviews and they were mostly fulfilled. Noisy, quick service and good food is what you can expect. I recommend you to reserve as there was a long waiting list at 5:30pm on a Thursday. 
Pad Thai and spring rolls were great, green curry lacked some Thai vegetables.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexandra K.,"Wanted to have dinner here with a friend at 8pm on Saturday. We were told that the wait would be an hour + so we decided to wait and have a drink elsewhere meanwhile.  An hour and 20 minutes later we went back since we had not yet been called. I had to go straight to the host (felt terrible about bypassing the line-up) and we did get seated right away. 
I've been to PAI various times before - always love the atmosphere- but I was highly disappointed by the food this time. Got a chicken skewer app. Which was great then had to wait 20 more minutes for the mains - my Pad Thai noodles were burnt and that taste stayed with me the rest of the night. To mess up the most basic dish at a Thai restaurant is terrible. 
I didn't complain because by this point I had already waited 1hr + 20 minutes  to sit and 30 minutes for the main. Just was too hungry to wait any longer for them to replace the dish. 
Suffice it to say I was unimpressed enough that I'm going to take my business elsewhere.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jannies L.,"Love this place, reservations make it easy to book unlike Khao San Road which is not saying anything about their delicious menu options.
Came here with the bf and ordered a pad thai and khao soi curry. We practically licked the plates and bowls they came on. I've been craving for authentic thai and he's never had much outside of canadian thai so I was glad Pai delivered for both of us!
I really want to go back to try their coconut curry! 
We had a beer and sake which was good and fairly priced. The service was a little absent, took us forever to get her to take our order, give us water (pad thai was nice and spicy) and give us our bill. So the 1 star is for that. 
Love the atmosphere but wish the tables weren't so squished together that i had to turn sideways to sit down. 
Will definitely be back!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lilly H.,"Solid 4/5
Its rare for me to give 4 stars out of 5 but this place deserve it. 
I tried most of their go-to dishes on the menu and I can confidently say if you don't mind the price tag, you should try as many dishes as possible because it's worth it! I was not a big fan of their famous Khao Soi or pad tai ( I mean they are still good but not mind blowing like what others said ) but I quite enjoyed everything else. 
Their green curry is not mind blowing as well but still have all the flavours that you look for when it comes to Thai curry 
My usual go to is pad gra prow with crispy pork. It's a fried rice dish with your choice of meat that's cooked with Thai basil serve with sunny side egg, cucumber and fish sauce. This dish has everything. There is tenderness of meat and crispness and juicy fat from crispy pork. Fish sauce brings all the flavours out and creamy runny egg York wraps all the flavours together. When you feel like it's little too much of fat, there is silky rice and crispy cucumber to balances out the dish. Perfect dish I'll like to have when I have a little cheat day.
Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup is another favorite of mine. Braised beef is so tender it just falls apart in your mouth. There is good balance between creaminess of peanut butter, spice, sweetness and sourness of lime. It was little bit on the heavier side than other Chiang Mai beef noodle soup I tried. Still darn good. 
If you are not into heavy dishes, just go for beef salad or papaya salad. They are very refreshing but yet has lots of flavour and quite filling. 
I took one star off because up and down of service. It's 50% chance hostess and servers will be very rude and forgetful and 50% chance they will provide the acceptional service. 
Also it's extremely busy during the dinner time so make a reservation or expect to be in the line for 30+ min. 
The place is cute and fun but to me the wait time and effy service ain't worth dine in. I highly recommend take out.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Raphael W.,"Pai is one of the best Thai restaurants in the city, and my favourite place to meet up friends for lunch in the financial district. 
There's no shortage of amazing Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto. There's Sukhothai, Sabai Sabai, Khao San Road, Nana, Salad King and of course Pai. 
There's pros and cons to each of the above Thai restaurants but Pai is a fan favourite because of the vibe, the ability to make reservations and the location. I come here very often for lunch, because I find their lunch chicken pad thai for $12.50 to be a great deal. 
At Pai I have tried-
Chef Nuit Pad thai: Tied with Sukhothai for the best pad thai in the city. Delicious. Make sure you mix it up while it's still warm and add the lime! The lunch version of this is just as big as the dinner version, but the lunch one is cheaper. 
Khao soi: This dish is amazing. It comes with Khao Soi gravy/curry with soft noodles and fried noodles. It's a mixture of crunchy and saucy softness. Delicious. Their khao soi gravy is amazing with rice too. I ordered this for take-out lunch once (also cheaper than dinner but same size) and they give you a VERY generous portion of khao soi gravy. It comes in a huge container and I froze the leftovers to be used on lunches I brought from home. Best idea ever. 
Khao Pla Tawt: It's a fried fish with rice. The fish here is very crispy and delicious. The sauces that it comes with is great. It's an amazing dish to compliment the pad thai or khao soi. 
Mamasan braised beef: Not so good. Its a beef curry with rice. I dont think I like beef at thai restaurants. Even the Khao soi and pad thai dishes, I always go with chicken. The beef chunks at Pai are very hard and not juicy. I cant recommend this. 
Service here is good, but the kitchen is a little slow. It's very close to St. Andrews station. Come here for an amazing pad thai but make resos cause its very busy!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bradley M.,"Great restaurant, atmosphere is pleasant, kinda of got a weird vibe but it's a good weird
Food was absolutely delicious and it's definitely a busy restaurant so show up early  
Service was good, they made some mistakes by forgetting our appetizer but it wasn't the end of the world",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Robert G.,"Came here for Toronto BBQ week and got the Pork Belly Sandwich with a pint
Very good and definitely a good place for lunch",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leona L.,"Delicious and authentic!
I ordered pad thai and it is the best pad thai I have ever had! I will definitely come back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carlos M.,"I'm sitting at a restaurant in San Antonio, TX and I randomly thought about y'all. It's been almost a year since I ate here. I loved it! I tell all of my friends they have to go to Pai when in Toronto. I was just telling my gf that I would fly to Toronto just to eat here again. Thank you for the memories :) 
The spot was fun. Highly recommend curry in a coconut. 
Basically, if you see the same thing on everyone's table.... GET IT!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Irene C.,"I've been looking for pad gra prow (basil chicken on rice with a fried egg) ever since I had it from a street stand in Thailand. This is the first place that I've been able to find it in Toronto and it is just as good and authentic as I remember. I highly recommend this dish. 
Pad thai - Pai's version of pad thai not a favourite of mine. I think it lacks the tangy tamarind that I prefer (although maybe it's more authentic this way)
Green curry - good curry with the added bonus of being served in a coconut. Be sure to scrape out and eat the coconut meat when you're done.
While this place is often packed (my friend and I went at around 6PM and we still had to wait about 10min for seats at the bar), the staff are friendly and take the time to make good recommendations.
Having been to local favourites such as Khao San Road, Sukhothai and Salad Kind as well, I have to say that Pai wins as my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mariana A.,This is my favorite restaurant in all Toronto. 5 out of 5 based on taste. I only created an account just to let you all know how good it is!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anthony P.,It was a great experience. With wonderful food.  The atmosphere was welcoming. The service was attentive.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zaineb O.,"I beleive that Pai is one of the best restaurant in Toronto. It's culinary aspect is incredible. It is very savory, full of spices, and somehow adheres to everyones taste. If it wasn't for the restaurant being full all the time, I would visit it more often.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mila C.,"This is one of the best Thai places in the city.  We tried the Khao Soi and the Gaeng Masaman with Braised beef.  Both were a perfect blend of spicy, savoury and sweet.  My only thing that I didn't like was both were lukewarm, that might be how it should served but I would of preferred it warmer.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Denis P.,"This is a amazing restaurant, great environment, the food comes quickly and the service is awesome! Value for money...",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jakobus J.,"This place is probably the best thai I've ever had. The food was incredible, the staff friendly and helpful, and the vibes fantastic. 10/10 would recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christ J.,I love Thai foods and especially this place. The Tom-yom soup is outstanding. I get addicted to that and I always order it when I come here. You guys should try it.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Porus V.,"The food here is amazing and the place has a great vibe! The server taking our order was a little clueless when asked about gluten/dairy in some dishes,  but would confidently confirm/deny it did, only to check back later and let us know it did/did not. My friend is allergic and had to be sure. It would be completely alright if the server just told us they could check and get back to us instead. Everything else was good and the place is definitely worth a visit.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J M.,"THIS RESTAURANT RUINED ME FOR ALL OTHER RESTAURANTS. It never disappoints and you always leave in a food coma. When my mother in law first visited us in Toronto we took her there, now every single time she comes, she insists we go at least once every time because she has never tasted Thai so good. And we completely agree. Throughout the pandemic we have been ordering lots to show our support and hold us over until we can be back at that magical place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Simran B.,"Amazing food, service, and ambience! My fiancé and I ordered fried rice and panang curry and were not disappointed. The only downside was the spice level which we were not able to adjust. Would have loved the dish to be a bit spicier. Will definitely visit the place again in the future!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,EJ C.,"Came here with my SO for dinner.  Nice trendy place, kinda packed and we had to wait a bit for our seat.  It's a nice place for the younger crowd.  
I ordered the braised beef gaeng masaman, she had the green curry.  It came in a coconut, nice trendy presentation of the food.  It looked as good as it tasted; it was so damn delicious, seriously.  Really tender and flavorful. Portion size was pretty good and I felt content after my meal.
Overall I gotta give this place 4.5/5.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny W.,"In my opinion, Pai is a bit better than Nana, the food here have a sweeter taste which most Canadian would like. Tried the curry and pad kra pow moo, curry's decent (you can choose your own spiciness) and pad kra pow moo is a bit too salty but still delicious. However, I wouldn't recommend the marinated raw crab, not my type of food.(or maybe I'm just not used to this kind of dish) 
 
Recommend this restaurant to everyone, better book online for a table in advanced otherwise at least one hour waiting is needed.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amelia C.,"This is easily one of the best thai restaurant in downtown. Everything tastes amazing. I went there on weekday during off peak hour but the place was already packed! Thankfully we didn't have to wait that long to be seated.
Pad thai, green curry, and moo ping were all taste good. I can't wait to go back and try different other things in the menu",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel S.,"Food and ambiance at Pan are great! Visited twice prior to posting this review, and ordered pretty much everything on their small but delicious menu. Everything was great!
Highly recommend the soup to start if you like spicy fare!
Only quam is the seating is insanely uncomfortable and squishy. Tables are right against one another and the chairs are plastic stools so forget any type of support. 
Food 9/10
Service 9/10",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeff H.,A delicious Yelp find!  Breaded fried meat on its own is delicious; add thai style sauces and Kabam!  Such a treat. The price was reasonable and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Can't wait to get back!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel A.,"Good food, and I'm not even big on Thai. I had the Pad Gra Prow with shrimp. At first glance, the dish looked like it might have been bland, but it was anything but! Lots of flavour, portion size was just enough to fill me up, and there were plenty of shrimp. The Thai Milkshake, which is made with condensed milk (have you ever tried eating this stuff right out the can?), is also a must-try!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danny T.,"It's really a great place to grab some good ""fusion"" Thai food. We tried quite a few things.. The papaya salad was ok, spicy and come with an assortment of carbs to go with it (quite nice). The tom yum soup was very tasty, and the ingredients were super fresh. The curry noodle (khao soi) was a bit on the richer side. It was good, but I just couldn't eat the whole thing. The basil chicken on rice was a bit sweeter than I normally life, but still tasted pretty good (and a bit too greasy). Overall, I'd come for the lively ambiance again!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Myra M.,"Been going here since it first opened.   The owner is the original owner of Khao Saan road.  It's authentic, fresh and has great service.  I also go to suko Thai there other location.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erin G.,"I was incredibly happy to find this restaurant on a rainy night in Toronto. 
We ordered a few curries and pad thai. The food was simply delicious. I look forward to going back to try more things. 
The staff was friendly and the service was great. 
We went on a Friday night and it was packed! We waited about 20 minutes for a table, which I guess is becoming average in Toronto.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kat A.,"Delicious and charming! The wait for a table can be a bit long, but if you go on the earlier side or with a small party you'll get in pretty quickly.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alan C.,"Great little spot downtown for dinner. Two of lined up for 10 minutes. Good music and casual dining environment. Bit noisy if that bothers you. Service was good and food was great. First time eating here and tried sangria, skewers, pad Thai, fried rice. All tasted great. We will come back again! Recommended to all.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sophon C.,"Make sure to get their early or make a reservation, as this place gets full fast.  Another great restaurant from the original owners of Sukkothai from Chef Nuit and Peter. This restaurant is another sample of Chef Nuit's Northern Thai cuisine, which is very similar to Laos style food.  Think more aromatic, earthy flavors, with a hit fresh herbs and dried chilies. My favorite is the Koi Soi, with its rich coconut curry broth, egg noodles, and fresh herbs. Good price points, and always consistent food. FYI my background is Laos, Cambodian, and our village was 30 mins from the Thai boarder.  So, my test for authenticity is to test their Thai, and I will always love an authentic Thai restaurant, run by Thai chefs.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rj R.,"My girlfriend and I arrived, had to wait a little almost 20-30 mins so arrive early if you want a good spot. Ambiance at Pai is totally worth checking out. Food was exceptional - definitely worth trying out the Thai iced Tea and the Khao Soi!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin S.,"tucked away in a basement in toronto's downtown core, this dim and busy northern thai haunt truly lives up to the absurd hype that it gets.  the decor evokes a street market-type of feel, and the menu definitely reflects that - just a bunch of delicious items that feel like they're meant to be purchased from and eaten on the streets of north thailand.  i also have no credibility since i've never been to thailand.  plenty of staff are employed here, and i've never had an issue with the service.
i've thoroughly enjoyed most of what i've tried here.  i'm not really impressed with the pad thai - it's not bad, but isn't as good everything else i've had.  i highly recommend: grabong (fried sliced squash fritters), som tum tad (papaya salad), khao soi, gaeng kiaw wan (green curry served in a coconut :o), gaeng hunglay (ox tail curry), pad gra pow, and the khao pad tamada.  all dishes are visually appealing, and are loaded with tons of flavours that all blend together really well.
my only gripe is that even though the portions are good, all of the dishes are a bit expensive.  knock a dollar off each item and this place would be perfect.
dine here on off-hours if possible, as it gets absolutely packed around lunch and dinner time",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dale S.,"If you like it..you will love it! Looks a little questionable when you walk in, but is actually a great experience. Sunday night about 6:30 and the place was packed. Wait in line on the stairs and we were the 4th party in line and only waited about 10 minutes. Very friendly server and was ready to take your order within a minute. She gave us time and came back in about 5 minutes. Interesting drinks; full bar; enjoyed both of our specialty drinks. Food was served very quickly and was fantastic. Vegan mushroom dish was probably #1 mushroom dish I have ever had.  Everyone there looked to be enjoying their meals; so I would say anything you fancy is good. Wish I lived in the area, because this would definitely be a regular stop!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina L.,"Only experienced Take Out, so I can't comment on the service. However, the food was GREAT. We tried the spring rolls for an appetizer, Chicken Pad Thai, Khao Soi with Chicken, and the Gaeng Masaman with Beef. 
The spring rolls were spring rolls but the curries were AMAZING! I probably went into sensory overload having the Khao Soi. I just wish there were more noodles, I wanted to drink this stuff. 
I think everything was reasonably priced and packed well for take out.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M S.,"Good Thai food, small portions versus price, extremely busy at lunch hour. Wait time could vary between 15-45min.",4

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jean L.,Freaking awesome.  Green curry. Grabong. Spring rolls.  Khao Sol with braised beef.  Order it. You won't regret it.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily Y.,"very nice ambience and nice food! Medium spicy is not spicy for asian , but the Thai spicy is more or less similar to the normal ones i tried in Thailand ;)
Highly recommended!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex G.,"Busy place, but well worth the wait. 
Went here on a Friday night with a group of 4 around 7pm - prime dinner time. We waited about an hour for a table, which wasn't all that bad. They text you when the table is ready, so that allows you to leave and grab a drink if you wish.
For starters I got the deep fried squash($11) and it was heavenly. It was a lot of food for a starter and definitely shareable between 4 people. It has had great presentation. Make sure you dip it in the sauce they provide you. 
I ended up having the pad graw pow, with crispy beef ($16.50) and it was delicious. I'm not much of a spice guy, so I got it with medium spice and I found that to be perfect - it was spicy, but I wasn't reaching for my drink after every bite. My friend got the khao so and I had some - that tasted even better and I was pretty jealous. Next time I'll definitely have to get that. 
Excellent atmosphere, fast service, great food and right in the heart of downtown - what more can you ask for. The price is obviously amazing considering where you are in the city and how busy the place is. They could probably charge double and only lose about 3% of their customers. 
Will be back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cin C.,"Having been a loyal Khao San Road fan for several years,  I was excited to try out Pai. Definitely a great space with alot more seating, and the reasonable noise level where you could still talk. I got the ox tail which was fall of the bone tender. It had the right level of spice to go with the rice it came with.  My friends all ordered the Thai ice tea which was good all around and everyone was pleased with their different dishes.  Service was on point and quick. Definitely will be back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Digna B.,"Authentic Thai food. Just love the way the restaurant is set up. Very unique and it feels homey. Service was great, even though they were busy at that time. Food was awesome. Prepared as authentic as it is. Highly recommended.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Johnny B.,Fun place to visit with nice presentation and lively atmosphere. This won't be the best Thai food you've had but it will be a solid meal. Still feels a bit restrained in terms of spices but maybe I'm benchmarking too much to the motherland.  Nice location and great place for a group meal.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jon L.,"The food here is just outstanding.  I will never ever buy pad Thai anywhere other than a proper Thai place any more.
Eating the pad Thai is an experience.  It's like watching a feel good movie that only comes along once every 10 years.  You feel amazing, you feel satisfied, you feel changed.  
Anybody that has anything negative to say about the food here is simply wrong or is confused in life.
I'll be back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cheryl T.,"Great food and ambiance!  We have been to numerous Thai restaurants and so far this is the best for us!  We came early because we know there is always a wait but we were seated within 15 minutes - the line outside is deceiving.  It is worth waiting even if it took longer than 15 minutes because their food is delicious!
The Pad Thai is my favourite.  Khai Soi seems to be my daughter's favourite because of its creamy taste.  We were scared to go 'Hot' on the spice level of our food because we are not too sure if we can handle it.  Instead we went for Medium.  I personally would like to go Hot next time as the kick of spice in my opinion adds more flavour.  Everything is good.  We will definitely be back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rodrigo G.,Awesome food and place! It is gets a bit fill and noise but food flavors are just really great,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha N.,"The first time I had Pai was as catering for a staff training session and I absolutely fell in love. I was raving about the food for months before I actually went to their physical location.
The restaurant itself is loud, dark, and hectic, but definitely has a fun vibe. As someone with a lower voice, unfortunately it was a little difficult to communicate with my dining partner.
The food was tasty, although not as fantastic as my first experience with it. I will credit it to being a busy lunch service when I decided to dine in. I will have to try again on a less peak period.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah R.,"This place has been one of my favorite restaurants worldwide since it opened, and it does not disappoint. The environment is rowdy and it's always packed, so you have to be in the right mood, but if so, prepare for incredible Thai food - especially the Northern Thai cuisine that is the speciality. Not to be overlooked is the INCREDIBLE tom yum. It's mind blowing. My favorite restaurant in Toronto, hands down.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Y W.,"This is my all time favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto. The vibe of the restaurant is fun and hipstery. Their drinks are decent, and the food is to die for! Some of their dishes are also presented in a cool way, like the green curry which comes in a real coconut. Their pad thai and fried rice is heavenly as well. I'm always craving Pai!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kellin L.,"Good vibe, good food. 
Disappointed that green curry didnt come in a coconut in lunch time though! :(",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria S.,I've had a really hard time finding amazing Thai food since coming back from Thailand two years ago. This definitely hits the spot!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shivanie M.,This place is a mix of North America meets Thailand. There is a lovely market indoors featuring Thai ingredients such as rose apples. Very busy place though and I don't blame them because their cuisine is delicious. Their Thai fried rice was so delicious featuring jasmine rice on a banana leaf which was accompanied with white chicken and all the Felipe's aromatic spices only know to Thai cuisine.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kanin K.,I've tried several items on their menu and all of them were really tasty! Hands down one of the best Thai food in the city.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bridget B.,"We love this place but it's always very packed, so expect a line! The Tom Yum Soup is to die for, I highly recommend (spicy). We also have to get the fried yam, and for a main i recommend the green curry. It comes in a coconut and you can eat the coconut meat on the inside that's just been steamed in the beautiful fragrant curry.",4

My Experience:  
Been coming here regularly for the better part of the last few years. Always consistent in the quality of food and service. Not necessarily ""authentic"" in a pure sense of Thai food, they offer a unique and delicious twist on classic and traditional Thai dishes. This twist is what makes Pai such an amazing dining experience!
I've always turned away from ordering Pad Thai at a Thai restaurant, often equating it to ordering General Tao's Chicken at a Chinese restaurant. However, Pai is the exception to this rule. Delicious fresh noodle with the perfect sauce makes this dish amazing. 
Laap Salad is one of my favourite dishes. Although a bit on the smaller size, it's an amazing Northern thai dish that is often harder to find around Toronto. The combination of pork, Thai Laap paste, sticky rice and the fixings make an amazing dish. 
Aside from the food, there is a wide variety of drinks. For the non-alcoholic drinkers, the Thai ice tea is a no brainer. For those that like a little strong libations, they offer some great beer selection, as well as unique ""Raptors"" inspired drinks, giving each starting team member their own special concoction. 
Spice is a huge part of the Thai experience, and this place knows how to do spice. Personally, I always go for Phet Mak Mak (Thai Spicy), which overs a strong flavourful kick, but nothing long lasting. There's a deep rooted flavour in the spice, rather than the painful spice one might experience with hot/suicide/armageddon/etc chicken wings. If you're fear it might be too much, I'd suggest Farang Spicy (foreigner spicy), which still packs a kick. 
You can't really go wrong with anything here, even the most basic dish still manages to have unique elements, and that's what makes Pai such a stand out hit!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Riss N.,One of the best Thai places in Toronto.  It is always busy but the tables are turned quickly.  Service is outstanding.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris S.,"Before we even begin, let me tell you that this place is serious about its spice levels. Mild is spicy. Medium is very spicy. Just our opinion. Gringos be warned.
When you walk down the steps to this place, you notice how many people inside are of Asian descent. This is a good sign. The wait was about 20 minutes, and we amused ourselves watching people and checking the decor, as well as with the classic American rock music that was playing. There were records on the walls.
The menu isn't long. The drink menu, I think, has more. We skipped the apps and starters and went straight for the meal. We had the same thing, which I can't recall the name of. It was on the top right of the main course menu, under the northern Thai section.
The sticky rice was great. The crispy pork was fantastic. The sauce was very tasty, even though it was very spicy. Lots of flavors. We may go back to try something else while we're here, which is about the highest compliment you can pay a place, right?
UPDATE: We went back. Wife had the curry with braised beef and I had the soup with beef broth. We dialed the spice down one notch each. It was fantastic. The wait was still there - there's never not one, it seems. We were seated in the chairless booth on mats. Loved it. Add half a star.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Janna S.,"The food here is phenomenal, so you better get here EARLY or you'll be waiting for a long time. It gets loud in here, so be prepared to speak louder than usual/shout. The fab cocoktail menu definitely earns a whole star on its own - yummy!
I'm not a big fan of the seating; it's rickety and rustic, but I guess that's half of the ""authentic"" appeal of this place. And the plus side is that the hard seats probably make it easier to turn tables quickly and bring more customers in for more $$$. Bathrooms are tiny but clean.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ke L.,"Solid selection, great ambience, encountered baby cockroaches once. Expect looong lines - everyone wants a piece of Pai",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jackie H.,"Awesome spot. A LOT bigger inside than you think. Different hallways and rooms with actual goods for sale (even Thai massages!), market style. Great decor.
The food was delicious. Gluten & dairy free options available! The food is well cooked and packed with authentic tasting flavors. Our table ordered: chicken panang curry (you can choose your spice level), pad Thai, and a beef curry dish. We started with chicken satays (which were a little small) and spring rolls. Everything got rave reviews. 
The only reason this visit wasn't 5 stars was because the food took a while to come out after we ordered and our gang was hungry. Otherwise the staff/service were friendly. Will definitely be back!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bonnie L.,"Great appetizer (that crazy sweet potato thing); terribly uncomfortable outside stools (please get something more comfortable for your customers who are paying good money to dine there!); poor serving size for the green curry for $17...honestly, I felt it was a rip off to be served a dish with nothing but sauce and 5 shrimp and a few strands of bamboo shoots! I've been to many other better thai places that actually give you a decent amount of veggies as well as shrimp (or whatever the protein) so this was a huge disappointment. I complained to the bar staff who offered to bring us another dish but explained 'that's just the way they make it'. Well it's enough to make me not go back. 
Take an example from many other amazing thai restaurants - ie: Thai Elephant on Queen West - and see what it means to offer your customers REAL value & quality for their money.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Xiaoman L.,"Heard that this is the best Thai in town and my friends and I tried this restaurant last week and it is terrific. We ordered Green Curry, salad and beef curry. All dishes tasted great. We went there in a Friday evening, and waited for seat for 30mins. However, it is worthwhile. But standing in the freezing wind was still pretty tough.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kay B.,"The Pad Thai was good, but not cult classic good as I was led to believe. Visit solo and sit at the bar. The wait is shorter. Lots of hype here and lines to prove to it. Atmosphere was super lively on a weekday night. Lots of cool decor around to discover. Reasonable cost for meal. I'd come back again no doubt to try out some of their other specialties.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Colron C.,"Came here with a date, great service, nice ambiance,  food was great, drinks were too.  Solid music. Highly recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christie L.,I love this place. Their green curry is awesome. So is the noodle dish with beef. They also have really yummy cocktails. I have been for dinner and lunch. This place is always busy so be sure to come early if you don't want to wait too long.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Felicia C.,"If it was possible to eat here everyday, I probably would. This place is my favourite Thai restaurant on Toronto. My favourite dish is their Chef Nuit's Pad Thai. Once you've had pad Thai here, you won't want to eat it anywhere else. It is must try!
Other good items on the menu are their green curry, khao soi, Chang Mai beef noodle, tom yum!! All extremely well made dishes :) this place never disappoints! 
If you don't have a reservation, make sure to show up early (around 5pm) for dinner or else you'll be waiting a long time!! This place gets busy! And they have no slow days.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kate S.,"When in Toronto, you should definitely give Pai Thai a visit!! My friends and I were visiting Toronto for fun, and decided to try something new, that being theThai food! When we decided to go, as soon as we entered we were immersed in a great cultural experience. The atmosphere was super upbeat, having a cool, chill vibe. It was super busy, but we only had to wait a couple minutes when we were offered to sit at the traditional Thai table meaning that we had to take off our shoes and sit on the floor while eating. At first we were hesitant, but we decided to go for it for the experience and sore booties aside, it was absolutely worth it! Not being experienced Thai food eaters, we were a bit confused on what to order, but the waiter helped us choose we would like best- he was great!! The three of us ordered three different dishes and an appetizer to share; we ordered an appetizer called the Grabong which is a must when visiting, the Pad Thai (which collectively we voted was the best meal out of the three), Gaeng Klawwan (which was a chicken in a curry-like broth in a coconut, it was ok) and the Khao Pla Tawt (a fried fish with rice while although tasty, was not that exciting, it didn't live up to its expectation as described in the menu). All in all, Pai Thai was a tasty and unique restaurant that one should venture to while in Toronto!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James K.,"Stop reading now and just head over there!
I've always liked Thai food. Like that super-basic white people version of Green Curry Chicken you get anywhere, even at like Jack Astors or Milestones. Then we travelled to Thailand. And I realized how far that was from REAL Thai food.
Not unlike the stuff we call Chinese food in Canada, which isn't really Chinese food. It's just food cooked by Chinese people to appeal to people who like popcorn chicken covered is cherry sundae topping.
Back to Pai. This restaurant is like a time machine that took us back to our honeymoon in Thailand. The food is just loaded with all these intense, unusual flavours that evoke strong memories. The food at Pai is authentic. The atmosphere is authentic. The service is authentic (like how nice are Thai people? They're best, all over Thailand.) I'd highly recommend this place to anyone whether you like Thai food or not- because it's an experience. Praise the people who run this spot because they've clearly put so much thought and effort into sharing their culture with Toronto.
Oh, and checkout the Monday Night Market. What a cool vibe!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clarence Y.,"They're overrated for the amount of people that flock to this place for dinner, but in terms of actual Thai food, I must admit they're pretty legitimate. I've been here at around early evening and have managed to salvage a table without lining up excessively. We ordered the Pad Thai and Coconut Curry (which they for gimmick serve in a coconut shell) which was a good portion to share. Prices are a little steep, but considering the area is decent. 
With drinks expect to pay around $25-30 per person, but if you're looking for authentic Pad Thai, then come here.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paul C.,This place was unbelievable. It was the best Thai food I've ever had-the flavor was excellent and they did not load up on MSG at all because I wasn't thirsty or sleepy after eating several different dishes with colleagues. This will definitely be my go to spot next time I'm in Toronto. Their drinks were also very delicious - the Thai mojito was my favorite.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Richie B.,"Found the curry a bit oily, 1 cm of grease on top of the curry.  Flavourwise, it was ok, but nothing that jumps out at you. The spice/herb flavours are also bit muddled.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Harry M.,"when i first went here i did not know what to expect, but as I ordered the spicy chicken pad thai for the very first time in my life. It tasted really good. I came along with my two other friends, althought theyve had it before they thought it tasted amazing. Now its our favourite spot.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer S.,"The food was awesome, the atmosphere rustic, warm, loud yet homey, and the wifi password was on the drink menu! Loved the food and the spice level options, the waitress was kind and energetic along with the guy at the front organising the seating and reservations.
The only downside was that we had to wait a little under an hour for a table for 6, but I can't deduct a star for that; it's not their fault that people love the place so much.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nitesh L.,By far my favorite restaurant in the city. My personal favorite is the shrimp fried rice. Its not a surprise they are packed during lunch on weekdays. Highly recommend to make a reservation if possible as its always crowded. Definitely planning to be a regular here!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joy Z.,"Came here 12:15 for a group lunch and was told to wait outside for 45 min. While we waited outdoor, most customers came in between and waited inside were seated - which pissed us off a little bit and almost gave up.
However we decided to stay and boy was it a good decision. The 5 of us were seated in the bar area and food came pretty fast because it was past 1 when we ordered.
I tried Panang curry with beef at Max spicy level and it was totally acceptable to average Canadian tastebuds. The curry is rich and creamy, flavoured perfectly and portion was just perfect. 
Would hv given it 5 stars if not for the seating drama.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pramita C.,"I'm not sure I get the hype! I got take-out so maybe its all about the location and ambiance (which to me just seems dark and a bit dank - but it might have been humid outside). The food is good, but not extraordinary.
If someone made reservations there, I'd be happy to attend and give this place another shot - afterall, the food is good! But I'd be happy going somewhere else, too.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roman Y.,The food is beyond delicious!!! I only wish we had a place like this in Chicago! Chicken Curry and Pot Thai were amazing! I'm not sure i ever had a better tasting meal in my life. I'm serious!!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kim M.,"Best Pad Thai in the city hands down. Massaman curry is amazing, spring rolls - there is literally nothing I've ever had here that hasn't been great. The vibe is so warm and the food is great whether it's pickup or eat in.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leyla K.,"Food is ok, service is good however too busy and you might not get everything on time. But it's nice overall.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jean L.,"Pai pai pai! You can't go wrong with Pai. I have to say is one of my all time top 3 Thai restaurant. Every single dish is amazing ;) 
For appetizers if not sure what to get, go for the fried squash. Great for sharing. In terms of mains, my personal favourites are the ox trail, fish and beef curry. 
Make sure to get a reservation during peak dinner hours. It gets very busy and there is always a long line up.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cara K.,"We came here just before noon during TIFF and got a table right away. By just after noon the place was packed. The service was really good. Each staff member that passed our table checked to see that we were ok. We had our 11 month old, so we asked for a bowl of hot water to heat up her baby food which they brought right away with an extra plate and glass of water. They look like hipsters but definitely don't have the attitude. 
I couldn't help but order Khao Soi with beef which I have had from Sukothai many times. It came assembled in a beautiful clay bowl. The beef was in large tender pieces and there were lots of noodles in the rich soupy broth. It is a winner, but I will try something different next time.
I also had the Thai ice tea, which tasted like a delicious, thin milkshake. It was bright orange with lots of crushed ice and and was made with sweet condensed milk. 
Pai is a great choice for a quick lunch downtown.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie N.,"If you are craving Thai food, look no further! Nothing beats the Pad Thai here. I typically get the Chicken Pad Thai medium spicy with a side of hot sauce so I can add more spice to it if I want. 
Another must is the squash fritters. They are basically deep fried squash fries. There is a saucy that comes with it. 
I really like the decor of the restaurant. You feel like you are in a Thai market. I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone craving Thai food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Darelys M.,Loved this place!!! Looks small but very large. Food was amazing!! I had the Pad Thai which was great and appetizers were delicious!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,William M.,Pad Thai was incredible. Wings and springs also very good. Green Curry beef was good but beef was a little over cooked. Good selection of local craft beer as well.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bob M.,I had a deeply emotional experience today. I never thought I could bond with my dinner but that's exactly what happened when I decided to order a dish who's name I can't pronounce. I wanted to talk to it. With every bite i felt the Force. The sauce was the magic. Everything was cooked to culinary perfection. This is poetic food.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anela M.,Pad Thai with shrimp was not bad. Even as takeout the noodles didn't stick or lump together too much.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cyn Nie L.,"Came here on my birthday with my bunch of friends. Had their crispy pork rice; not sure what they call it. And loving it. 
Love how they let you choose the spicy level. The ambiance is good just a little bit noisy during dinner time. Took a long time to ask for a bill, but the waiters are friendly.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tim R.,"My favorite spot in Toronto. Amazing food, cool vibe. It's best to get a reservation as it fills. The Thai mojito is awesome.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Destiny N.,"Great food, great atmosphere, wonderful staff! The food can never go wrong here. I never liked Thai food up until I tried Pai. Khan soi was packed with full of flavours, pad Thai was one of the best pad thais I've ever tried in my life. Don't forget the Thai iced tea to go with your meal!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chanisa C.,Awesome food and the architecture inside is very unique. It really feeling you station in Thailand. The taste was real Thai foods.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ezra G.,"Always enjoy coming here. Great food. Good music. Huge beers available.
Seeing as I have quite a few food retrictions, food allergies and vegetarian, they always have good options for me. I particularly love the pad gra prow and the green curry. Ps if you like spicy, this is a great spot for you!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Henry B.,"Best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand, and maybe including Thailand. The khao soi is incredible as are the coconut shrimp and the green curry. Actually, everything is amazing, you can't really go wrong.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maricia Y.,"I was here last night for my birthday & it was fantastic. The service was speedy, the workers were polite & the food was delicious. The Thai wings sauce was amazing just a bit undercooked. Overall I had a good experience",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna L.,"We got chef nuit pad Thai with tofu, gaeng klaw wan green curry in a coconut and khao soi with shrimp all with a medium spice - was the perfect amount of spicy. Everything was rich and delicious. At the end we could not decide which dish was our favorite.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David O.,"First time having northern Thai food... at least I think so anyway. I was impressed by the flavors of the Pad Gra Prow with Tofu. The egg was a pleasant surprise and medium heat was perfect (I generally don't like intense heat). 
Patio was nice as it was a beautiful day, but beware of the car/truck noise. 
Only downside was that my tofu was a little over cooked, but didn't ruin my dish.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,DM S.,"Best pad thai, best green curry, great atmosphere. Try to come here any time we're in T.O.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Haaris M.,"Incredible Thai food, but basically everyone in the GTA knows that pai is the best Thai food you can get in the city. Great service, incredible tasting food, and pretty reasonable price, being about 20 dollars for any dinner dish after tax and tip. Love coming here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yvonne C.,"Came here for lunch during a weekday, and as soon as I stepped in I felt whisked away from the suits and hard lighting of the financial district. Amazing decor and despite the fact that it's underground and natural lighting was at a minimum, it didn't feel stuffy or dingy. It was bumping around 1, but had for the most part cleared out by 2 or so. 
The PAD GRA PROW offered so many familiar comforting flavours, yet I had never had the dish before. The pork option comes with tender ground pork, and the beef option gives you a little bit more chew. I liked the beef. Topped with a runny egg and this just might be my new comfort dish.
The PAPAYA SALAD was well seasoned and I enjoyed that the dried shrimp were so large that you could get some chew out of them but my dining companion wasn't quite as fond of the shrimp. Portion size was perfect to share amongst two people, and it was also served with shirmp chips and chicharrons.
The THAI TEA was delicious, served classically over a ton of crushed ice. A little bit sweet for my usual palate but I loved the spices that came through. 
Apparently they were running a once-a-month night market, but will be scaling back to once-a-quarter in the new year. Def interested in checking that out!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Walter I.,"Thai iced tea makes a summer day so easy to get through. Spicy Caesar's to wake you up too. But everything on the menu is delicious to me, come early.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kim H.,"One of my most favorite places for Thai food - hands down!!! I've traveled all over the world, including 6 cities in Thailand, and this place is an absolute gem! Spectacular service, authentic cuisine, good vibes and a lively atmosphere. 
The pad Thai has a unique flavor and the green curry (served in a young coconut) infuses the right balance of heat and spices. 
Best specialty cocktail is the ____ Ross! If you like Thai iced tea and Kahlua - you'll love this combination!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chatter B.,Great good. Great vibe. Insanely busy restaurant. Smaller menu which makes decisions easier and allows them to execute on taste. No brainer - you must visit!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shawna B.,"I've been to Pai a few times now and typically I get green curry (LOVE) but i noticed this time, only 4 pieces of chicken in the dish. I've also sampled the menu and was impressed with the coconut shrimp among lots of others. My friend really didn't like the curry but never said anything.. we sat there with a full meal in front of her and no service for a while. When the waiter came back he asked if she wanted anything else but didn't comment on the full plate of curry in front of her. Just not the best experience, she was turned off but ordered the shrimp to go. I've experienced way better... I hope things aren't going down hill for you Pai...",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ingrid B.,Best Thai in Toronto! Unique food and awesome atmosphere! The place is huge and very cozy. I went with husband and friends and everyone loved,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha P.,This is apparently THE place of all places for Thai in Toronto! We were told it would be 45 minutes to an hour wait on a Wednesday night but we walked like 20 minutes to get there so we were staying. It ended up only being about 25 minutes until we were seated & I would say the food was worth it! Great Thai cuisine with great music and a cool location & atmosphere,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Frank K.,Excellent food and fast service!!  Had Pad Thai and a fried fish (forgot name) and both super good. Highly recommended!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah W.,"Pai is one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto for three reasons: authentic and delicious food, plenty of seating, and relatively quick service. My favourite is the green curry (with shrimp) that comes in a coconut. The curry is incredibly aromatic and even more tasty. I like to scrape out the coconut meat with a spoon and mix that in with the curry sauce, which I actually haven't seen a lot of people do! 
The khao soi is pretty good too, as is a beef dish that I forget the name of. I find the pad thai underwhelming. When I ordered it, it was dry and not very tasty, but it could just have been a subpar plate. 
You can order any level of spice, from absolutely no heat to Thai spicy (watch out-this one's hot). If you try to come here for dinner on a weekend, note that it'll be VERY busy (expect 40-60min wait depending on group size). However you can leave a cellphone number and have them text you when the table is ready, so you don't have to physically wait there. 
TIP: this restaurant has a great private room that you can book for no extra fee (just a set gratuities that automatically comes on the bill). It seats about 20 people max and is nicely decorated.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Denise G.,This is one of my favourite Thai place both for food and atmosphere. Can't wait to go back. Their Pad Thai is to die for.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Phyu S.,Not really price worthy of a place. Decoration price took a toll on quality of food serve here.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel T.,"Pretty much the closest thing you'll get to Northern Thai food in Toronto. Food does not disappoint though. Pretty sure this comes close to the most expensive delivery I've ever ordered, however this place keeps bringing back time and time again. 
Top 3: 
1. Khao Soi - Curry with egg noodle goodness that I always order. Careful with the spice levels as clearly warned by the order taker every time. I fail to listen, and always get Thai Spicy. 
2. Chef's Pad Thai - Super authentic and massive portions. You won't find ketchup in this noodle dish! Toasted peanuts and fresh bean sprouts makes this dish extremely addicting. 
3. Pad Gra Prow - Rice dish with fried egg and pork. Make sure to get it with pork! The little bits of crispy cracklin make it extra delish!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex C.,"Wonderful little place here, friend asked me to come over for dinner and thus I did and so happy that I dined here.  I personally love Thai food, but locally in Mississauga, I myself don't really know too many great Thai places (if there are, please message me!).  Gotta say, it's a place I'm definitely willing to come back.
When you walk in, and walk down the stairs, you don't feel like you're going to a Thai restaurant at all.  The walls are filled with comic book covers, album covers of the Beatles and a ton of referential pop culture stuff that harken back to the 60's and 70's (and there's a bit of basketball stuff).  Also, the place is pretty loud, music's blasting and space is pretty cramped.  It's ideally not my type of a restaurant setting but it's located in the Entertainment District, so the place matches with the area itself.  But I personally would recommend, maybe a reconsideration of seating arrangments, because the tables are pretty close to one another (now mind you that's just my preference)  Also, I got seated in a more secluded area where the noise wasn't as pronounced, so lucky me.  Service was pretty good, they continuously came around, struck conversations with us (despite how busy they were) and were very friendly, so big +.
The menu is pretty much Thai food with maybe some modern flair, but the prices are standard, per dish ranging between the $10-$20.  My friends ordered the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup, Beef Green Curry, and I myself had the Khao Paw...(can't remember the dish name, but it's basically Fried Basa Fillets /w oyster sauce and rice with fried scallions.  
The wait for the food was a tad longer than I expected, but they were packed for a Saturday afternoon (5pm), so it's a strong testament that even on somewhat off peak hours that they can pull such large crowds.  
Meal wise, fish is fried to perfection, I don't know if I've ever had fish that smooth and buttery.  They provided two sauces, oyster sauce and the spicy one.  Wasn't a fan of the spicy sauce, it kind of took away from the taste of the fish itself.  But overall my dish was so good, the fragrant jasmine rice, and the pairing of fried fish/oyster sauce was like a perfect bite.  Funny enough, I wasn't even hungry entering the place, but my appetite continued to increase as I proceeded to mow that thing down.  Delicious!  Green curry was lovely too, with the coconut milk paired with it always hits the spot.  Chiang Mai, the beef part, was very tender, so I enjoyed that as well. :)
Overall, definitely would recommend this Thai place if you're in the area!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eldingo D.,"The food is really good, especially the curries. The green curry is a must try (Penang curry), the cocktails are very good but the best thing about this place is the decor and ambiance and atmosphere. The reason why I am giving it one star, when it should really get a 5 star is the personal experience I had. I told our server 2,3 times that I am extremely allergic to shrimp, that it'll kill me if there is shrimp in my food, and asked her to note it down. When she brought my ""checked curry"" it was filled with actual shrimp. But since the coconut shell was filled with the coconut milk and the broth, I couldn't see the shrimps and it was possible that I eat the broth and be dead by now!!! Luckily, before I start my food, I asked my friend to try some of my curry and then he realized there is shrimp in my food, just when I was about to eat it!!!! Now I would have been dead because the server made a mistake but the worst part was the restaurant management! Not only it took them 30 min to bring me another chicken curry , but also they even charged me for it!!! Everyone on our table finished their food and were waiting for me meal to arrive! I think I made a mistake by not making it a big deal... I felt bad for the server so I kept saying, it's ok, it's ok don't worry, thank God I'm still alive and .... but the least management should have done is to serve that food complementary, like any other food establishment would have done this .... the min they should have done.
Pai was my fav place and I used to go there at least 2,3 times a month but after this behavior not only I am not going , but my friends also decided not to go there again. I think it was so inconsiderate of the management (who came to my table to ask about my allergy after the incident), but ultimately went and charged me for the whole thing... the super late food, the drink and ....
So disappointing .... some practices are just industry's norms.... maybe an experienced manager would have know that they should have not charged me or had to offer something as an apology....",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris K.,"Outside of my favorite Thai restaurant from growing up, definitely the best Thai I've had anywhere. We arrived a bit early and were seated immediately, but it was clearly a popular place and there was quickly a line waiting for tables. The drink list here was super unique, with tasty options such as the Lowry (gin, lemongrass syrup, mint, lychee juice and soda) and the Thai Ross (vodka, Kahlua, Creme de Cacao, Thai iced tea). Delicious. For dinner I went standard with the Pad Thai and wasn't disappointed. The table seemed to have some issues with their spice levels - an appetizer was ordered medium and was scalding hot, while two mains ordered a spice level higher were almost spice-free and had to be supplemented. Altogether, a solid experience and would definitely come back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nick C.,"Food is good. However, I feel that Thai food in Toronto could be much better if Pai didn't own all the competition.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alisa C.,"This is one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto and also some of the best Thai food I have ever eaten. The food is always consistent and delicious I've never had a bad meal here. It can get very busy but it's worth the wait so if you aren't a line person come early or try to make a reservation. I have never had to wait more then half an hour to be seated though. 
The only reason that I am not giving this 5 stars is because of the service, it can be very slow and I've even had some really bad servers here. I don't let it ruin my experience though because the atmosphere is so unique and the food is so good.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,HeerO A.,This place seems confusing at 1st but has its game on point with the food. Some Thai places sub taste for the population fragile palette this place is not one of them best Thai spot in Toronto 2nd in North America to Thai pepper,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samiha M.,Went here for lunch with my buddies and ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with tofu and veggies and really liked it. All of chef Nuit's previous restaurants that she's started up have  served amazing thai food and Pai is obviously no expectation. Service was good and food didn't take too long to come out. Everyone had a good time and liked the food. Would recommend for thai food,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chepa W.,"Heard about for so long as the best Thai food in town, only today's lunch did I get to taste it. Yes, very good. There were 6 of us ordered 5 different things and everyone was saying delicious. So basically you can't go wrong ordering anything on the menu. Will definitely come back here. 
Two things though I need to warn people: 1) the noise level is really high. There is no caustic treatment on the walls or decor. 2) I hope is only today, the hot water boilers broken, so no hot tea! It is very odd not to have tea in an Asian restaurant. For me tea is important when enjoying a good meal.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bernice L.,"This place is totally bumpin.  It's loud and the atmosphere is is perfect for a weekend dinner with friends.  It is also very, very busy here!  Be prepared to wait.
I had the laap salad to start, khao soi with braised beef as my main and a mango smoothie to wash everything down.  I saw lots of people around me order the grabong as a starter, which is the deep fried squash and I regret not getting that as well.  The laap salad was okay.  I think I expected something different (ie. something similar to the larb salad at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas).  I wouldn't order the laap salad again.  The khao soi was amazing.  It was creamy, delicious and perfectly seasoned.  I could eat that over and over again.  I was stuffed and didn't save room for dessert but I would've loved to try the mango sticky rice!  
This place is a solid choice for thai food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roy R.,"One of the hardest reservations to get in town but without question, worth it.  There are ordinary Thai staples on the menu but don't be fooled, this is not your ordinary Thai restaurant. The food is elevated. The flavors will set the standard to the point where you will just shrug your shoulders every time you go to any other Thai joint. Even the drinks are on a next level. It took me a good month in advance to get a weekend reservation and it did not disappoint.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah L.,Good taste. Carefully select spicy level. It is spicy,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,SamMax ..,"Great quality and fusion of food! Prices are a bit expensive, but then again if you're the #1 Thai restaurant in the city, why would you not charge more.
Line-ups can be frequently long, so make a reservation OR #UberEats it!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christabelle B.,"Pai is my go-to thai place! The atmosphere here is very vibrant, they play great music and the staff are always so friendly. It does get pretty crowded, so I'd recommend making a reservation. I usually order the chicken pad thai, khao sai with beef with a side of rice and maybe 3 or 4 glasses of their thai iced tea! (haha clearly a MUST)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jose O.,"Let's start by 2,200+ reviews you already know it's going to be good. You were wrong it's  the food was delish and the ambiance is phenomenal. Make sure you stop by!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ken M.,"If you have been to Thailand or a proper Thai restaurant then you'll like this spot.  
Curries are fantastic and pad thai is excellent.   They also can make it thai spicy as well - which is pretty hot.  
Definitely a recommended spot if you're craving thai food.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela A.,"Step into one of the best restaurants in Toronto. Well worth the wait. We arrived at a busy time. Cosy restaurant with great service good food and reasonable prices. We ordered practically everything on the menu and most dishes were delicious and very flavoursome. Really good Thai food and much more authentic and creative than your usual generic Thai restaurant...Great Service and food! Made an amazing night even better... ;) Ohhh The mango sticky rice was the best we've had in the world. Better than Thailand, better than anywhere we've had in the States. Make sure you put your name on the list early in the evening as the wait rapidly becomes very long and can easily reach a couple of hours.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zezheng X.,Excellent authentic Thai food! Green curry was delicious. Very rich and creamy taste. Appetizers were of nice portions and tasted just as good. Good vibe and service was excellent. Would definitely recommend!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lexia R.,"Firstly, I want to say considering you have to make a reservation a month in advance, I had high expectations that were not met at all. I got the Chef Nuit Pad Thai 13; there was this disgustingly bitter taste that kept reoccurring every 1-2 bites that ruined the whole plate for me. I definitely would not recommend this place due to my bad experience. Although, other dishes might be reallly good, I do not recommend the pad thai. If you want good pad thai, I'd recommend going to Salad King.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leah K.,"If you're looking for a flavour that will spark your taste buds, this is the place for you. The best Thai find I've experienced yet. The taste isn't just strong but it's unique. They make their own chilli oil which is so yummy and their Bloody Caesars are crafted with a house made spice rim and Tom Yom. Very spicy! Great environment, fun, loud hip hop/old rap classics for playlist, but service could improve. Server didn't introduce herself and the food took long, but overall, delicious!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara W.,"Great value. Had the soup and Pad Thai and a curry. 
EXCELLENT - Best Ive had yet in the city, topping my last standing fave the Thai room. 
very nice textures, seasoning and perfectly cooked. 
Will be ordering from here regularly.
The  Khao Soi - Too spicy for the Bf, not spicy enough for me... Next time.. two orders, twice as happy.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zac B.,Pai is one of my favourite Thai places in Toronto. Their Khao Soi is fantastic and the best one I've had so far. I've ordered from them several times and the food has been very consistently delicious!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nelly R.,I'd say one of the best thai restaurant I've ever eaten in downtown Toronto. Way better than Salad King for sure and any other thai restaurant for that matter. The fried fish with green curry sauce and the papaya salad was my fave dish. I'd definitely be back here with some group of friends and i would recommend families and friends to come here to eat some flavourful thai cuisine!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren R.,"I've been to Pai a few times and unfortunately haven't branched out beyond the pad thai! It's delicious with the perfect balance of flavours. I've been to Thailand, and this is a fairly comparable version to what I ate there. It's a really satisfying and fresh dish without being overly greasy or heavy. 
Although it wouldn't stop me from ordering it, I think it's a bit overpriced. You don't get a lot of meat, especially if you order shrimp, which is an extra $2. 
I really want to try some other dishes here. Will definitely continue coming back for more pad thai (and maybe I'll eventually branch out)!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dean S.,"I do not usually bother to write reviews for restaurants out of town, but this place was super impressive.  We were in town for the Rogers Cup and I saw such good reviews, so we decided to hoof it over to this place.  Like other reviewers have written, the wait is long, but worth it.  The bar staff is quite efficient, there are some good drink options, and the vibe is nice and lively, so the time passes before you know it.  The food is super and the service was great.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,William G.,"Excellent! Busy location but they work and move customers orders fast the staff is great, well worth the wait. Beautiful Bartender served me snd she was excellent, and so cute. She was very helpful, great to have there. The food was amazing the starters and Ox Tail was great. I will go again! Staff was fantastic!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shanti D.,Everything was memorable and extremely enjoyable.  Pad thai was amazing and the Pad gra prow was phenomenal.  Will definitely come back.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine T.,"I think it's a bit overrated but good food overall. I only really liked the fried rice. Pad thai & khao soi were good, not amazing.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Safa K.,This place was so packed and claustrophobic when I went in. Maybe it was the layout and the fact that the tables were so squished together that made me feel that way. Their pad Thai was good but nothing special. Wings were super hot and fresh when we got them which was a plus. Service was decent. They could definitely be more friendly.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aga K.,"This place fills up for a reason; a group of us attended and were amongst a line up of a few others to get in for lunch. So, if you're trying to go with a bigger group, be prepared!
The counter to that caution is that it is well worth it. The place has an island vibe mixed with family memories and service to match. Our server was efficient and prompt. I chose the ceasar as a beverage and boy, it was tasty. We also tried the shrimp appetizer (yum) and I kept it basic and ordered a mild chicken pad thai. The portion was sizeable and I ended up taking the remainder home. Our group was moved to a small table near the bar after our server respectfully asked if we didn't mind moving... no problem there. We then got handed over to bar staff who were assisting. Those guys were friendly and knowledgeable about the drink menu.
The only caveat I'll throw in is that the menu is quite small, so keep that in mind!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ritisha L.,"This place is close to my work so I've been lucky to try quite a few things here. Order anything here, you can't go wrong with it! Except maybe the Thai iced tea haha.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela R.,"WORTH THE WAIT! My boyfriend and I came here from Buffalo. Tried to make same day reservations but unfortunately was booked so we decided to take a chance and wait in line because we read such awesome reviews. We waited in line for about 10 minutes, put our names in, was told it would be a 25 minute wait but instead was only a 2 minute wait. Got seated right at the bar. Ambiance was amazing. Drinks were fantastic (amazing sangria). And food was to die for. The curry could not have been better.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Enas A.,"My husband and I had this place bookmarked after seeing it on Taste Toronto's Instagram page and getting confirmation from a friend that it was a must try spot! 
We ordered a the Khao Soi with beef brisket, papaya salad and an order of the oxtail in addition to a couple of beers. Everything was really good especially the Khao Soi. Tax and tip we paid $78 dollars.
Def worth a visit or two !",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yi H.,I miss dining at Pai! They definitely have the best pai thai among all that restaurant in Toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Philip C.,"Came here on a Saturday. I had their Khao Soi for dinner. It was seasoned perfectly with just enough of a ""kick"" in terms of spice. The egg noodles were crispy and the braised beef was cooked nice and tender. I also tried their sangria, which was lighter than I'm used to but still good to help wash down this heavy meal. My only regret was not getting a table in the patio as the main restaurant area gets pretty crowded. I'll definitely come here again to try their other dishes!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vincenzo F.,Have dined in and out several times and in the words of Meryl Streep AMAZING experience each and every time! The wings are especially authentic with great plating and superb taste. Huge on dessert and have tried one of each to my delight :),5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Balu V.,"I had food in Thailand and this place came pretty close. We ordered papaya salad (could have been spicier), oxtail (10/10) and laap salad (my first time trying this, very good). They also had great selection of beer and cocktails. I recommend this place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lynda K.,"Delicious food, great atmosphere, and friendly service. Very busy and packed but well worth the wait! Definitely try the fried shrimp if you're debating on an appetizer!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roxana M.,"Toronto! It's about time we get an amazing, authentic Thai Restaurant in town. I love the location, decoration, the staff ""JEFF"" (the owner), and most of all the food! YUMMY! Every time I go to Malibu, California, I always go to a similar restaurant called ""Cholada"" and I always said I wish we had something like this in Toronto. Well, I don't have to wish no more! PAI is by far the best Thai food I have ever had in Toronto. YOU MUST GO! I highly recommend these dishes: Miang Kung, Grabong, Tom Yum Nam Sai Kung Mor Fai, Khao Pad Thamada, and Pad Thai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Trinity Z.,"To be perfectly honest, I stumbled into this restaurant because we couldn't get seats at Khao San Road.
Never have I ended up so happy with changing dinner plans before. 
Pai is edgy, innovative, and delectable. 
Highly recommend the following: Chef Nuit Pad Thai, Gaeng Masaman with braised beef, Khao Soi with Beef and Gaeng Kiaw Wan with Chicken
The dish I enjoyed the most was definitely the Khao Soi. It has been awhile since I have tasted braised beef so tender. The mix of fresh egg noodles in golden curry, topped with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions and shrimp paste was so exquisite and pleasing to the palate. 
I also really love how they served the green curry in a real coconut.
Make sure to order their Pineapple Cocktail, which is served with 2 oz of Malibu in an actual pineapple! 
I would definitely recommend complementing your curry with the classic Thai Iced Tea. The sweetness of the tea and spiciness of your curry strangely go very well together.
I really liked the vibe of the restaurant as well. It is a bit dim, but very lively. People were surprisingly well-dressed as well. It can get a little loud, but not so rowdy that you can't hold a conversation. 
Despite the proximity and similarity in dishes, I would honestly choose Pai over Khao San Rd. now. The pricing is cheaper at Pai and the wait is shorter. Pai also takes reservations.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jaslanika Pritam B.,"This is a great traditional Thai restaurant. The food is amazing, I was surprised by the quality of food as I want expecting how great it was! The service was efficient and quick! We'll def be back :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James W.,"This place is great if you want to have a more open Northern Thai experience, everyone here is very friendly and speaks English fluently which helps to avoid any mixed up orders. The place has high tables, bar-stool seating for the most part and is normally packed with the owners memorabilia from his time in Thailand, plus some eclectic disco, Jamaican and Caribbean decor. The music was great, playing classic, funk, disco, rnb and though it didnt fit with a Thai themed restaurant it was fun.
Since we were on a tight schedule we decided to have mainly starters and drinks before our show. Between the grabong, shrimp cocktails and soups we were quite pleased with the result. fresh ingredients, home made dipping sauces, and fresh ingredients really kicked off our night. The drink menu and pricing is way off in some cases, and reflects the local area more than it does actual value. Not to mention that half of the good drinks we wanted were unavailable. Good food, good experience with pricing a bit high at points.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Priscila S.,"So glad I made the time to visit Pai when in Toronto. The good reviews I read here are definitely well deserved. The staff was very helpful and responsive, the atmosphere is legit, but most important the food is sooo good. I had the sangria that had lychees, so weird but so perfect. Can't remember the dishes name - had ground beef with crispy pork and fried egg - the bar tender recommended it and it was divine.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Simon D.,"I loved this place; it was a boiling hot day and just visited the Aquarium nearby with my family. We stumbled across this place for lunch...and wow! Small and unpretentious but with a great atmosphere and fantastic Thai food. We all went with Pad Thai, but word of warning, unless your mouth is made of asbestos, do not go with the very spicy option. The waitress was very sweet.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cathy H.,"Khao soi is F***ING *drools*. The green curry is nice but the Khao soi steals the show.
A little on the moderately pricey side but not ground breaking. The sausage appetizer plate runs on the small size considering the price, but extremely satisfying.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eli L.,"Authentic, tasty and clean. The pad thai has a variety of veg and is a perfect portion. The Curries are delicious too! Never disappoints.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex W.,The tom yum soup came out luke warm and cooled off rather quickly. I think they forgot to put the fire cube at the bottom or they've started to become cheap.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tony K.,"My goodness. I've been to this place about 7 times (and counting!) and their food is so consistently amazing. No wonder this place is always packed in the evenings! The atmosphere is always upbeat and lively while the staff are attentive and very friendly.
Their Pad Thai is hands-down the best Pad Thai I have ever had and I find myself craving it all the time (even immediately after I leave the restaurant). What a fantastic experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Walter M.,"I've been here a few times, the Pad Thai and Pad Gra Prow are very good.
Overall it's very tasty, but popular. So seating a group on short notice is a problem. 
Also it's on Ritual, so you can get take out easily.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sharie W.,"Amazing Thai food! The portions are average-sized, and the entrees range from $15-19. The waiter recommended some dishes to us, and I took his suggestion and ordered the Pad Gra Prow with Chicken, Farang Spicy (other options were mild, medium, and thai spicy). As the waiter explained, thai spicy is a notch above farang spicy and tl;dr you gotta be pretty confident in your spice tolerance! My personal tolerance is pretty high, and I thought farang spicy was perfect, so use that as reference. The fried egg that was placed on top of the egg was really unique and delicious; the whites were super crispy, while the yolk was easy/medium. I also tasted their Pad Thai, which was different from anything I've ever had before and absolutely amazing.
You also may want to make a reservation since the place is very popular, although I didn't have to use my reservation when I showed up around 1 PM.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danielle W.,"The food here is great, I never thought I'd go to a Thai restaurant that could rival Khao San Road. I asked for a recommendation from our waiter, and he suggested the Pad Gra Pow (pork + friend pork on spicy rice) and I can't stop dreaming about this dish. One of the best thai dishes I've ever had. 
The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was that last time I was there, our waitress repeated back our order to us, only to forget items, and then not offer to bring them out until we were nearly done the rest of the food. It took way too long to get her attention to correct that, get drinks, or pay the bill. Our group of 6 people would've definitely drank 4 beers or so each instead of the 1 or 2 that they were able to order. Plates were also cleared out prematurely, which we needed to stop - I guess communication overall was just a little awkward and too sparse. 
Beyond that one experience this is a great restaurant, with a great vibe and vibrant, delicious dishes.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julianne M.,"Must try when visiting Toronto!!! Best Thai food I've eaten. Great service, cool ambience and definitely worth the wait. Wish I could bring this place back with me to Miami!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lillian M.,"Although a bit overpriced, this place was good for Thai food.
We had the curry noodles, soi Khan(?) nd that was really good - we have had this at Malaysian restaurants as well.
The vegetarian dish was nothing to write home about. 
This is 3.5 but I bumped it to 3 stars b/c this restaurant is not one I would repeat if I had other choices.  Nothing wrong to all those that like this restaurant, I have had the opportunityto eat at great Thai/Malaysian places that I think are better.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chaitanya W.,"Best ambience and great food. The place is situated in the basement area but has huge crowd pouring in. The administration has well trained staff, quick service and yummy food. Highly recommended",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cathy L.,"Love it. Just love it!
Amazing place comes with very long line up. It might not be the place to dine in, if you are in a rush. But they do take out and delivery. So it's still amazing!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexa D.,"Food here is always consistent and very tasty. Best Thai food outside of Thailand.
It can be very busy and on some evenings I've felt a bit rushed where they brought the bill before I was finished. I do understand that they want turnover since there is typically a long line. It's really appreciated that they accept reservations.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kate F.,So delicious. I feel like I'm back in Pai whenever I eat there.   Delicious drinks as well. Expect a lineup but you can put down your name and grab a drink there or elsewhere. Highly recommend.,5

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,BN F.,Their foods are kinda salty to me .It's crazy busy restaurant in a busy area so it's hard to get a parking spot as well as a table,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael L.,"It's not even a debate for me. The best Thai I have ever had in my life! 
Fantastic!
It's not even a marginal difference... it's substantial. 
I seriously don't know what the other Thai food places are doing, but they need to figure out what these people do and replicate.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leslie S.,"Delicious with deep uncompromised tastes
I like the curry and the soups, but everything is good. It seems like their philosophy is authenticity and not compromising for Canadian palettes.
The décor is nice and looks interesting. They have put an effort into it.
the restaurant is busy and packed, but they have not become inattentive with service. They could smile more, but do have the smarts to still be polite and communicative. In fact, the owner came around to thank us for coming when he had 100 other customers.
Also, prices are reasonable.
I hope they don't drop standards like every other business...
Favourite: khao soi
Glad that: their pad thai doesn't come with Ketchup like those other so-called Thai places",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna T.,"I love Pai. It's the best thai place I've been to in the city. They have more than enough portions for one person and their prices are very reasonable. The spring rolls are really tasty. And the chicken skewers with the peanut sauce is dream-worthy. Because we had 2 appetizers, we shared a main: beef pad thai. OMG. Sooooooooo yummy. I am definitely coming back to try the other dishes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katy U.,"Amazing food--probably the best Thai in the city, but their delivery has gone downhill steadily. We have been regular customers since it opened, and have dealt with them regularly giving us levels of spice we did not order (I get it, it happens, but it's pretty much every time now), but it has gotten to the point where they seem to want to push their customers away. I have yet to order without calling 30+ times (they have no call waiting; you have to hit redial until it works), but like i said, the food's so good, I will put up with that. The apps they have partnered with both do not offer the full menu, so we can't use them to order what we want. 
Tonight when we called, having ordered & received delivery SINCE IT BEGAN OFFERING the service, we were told rather rudely that their bike courier no longer will go to the intersection where we live, so we can't order delivery anymore. (we are less than half a block past the apparent cutoff). Let' just be clear, we live less than 2 km from the restaurant, so it's not like we're asking them to ship it up to North York.
I would think that if a loyal customer tells you they've been ordering from you repeatedly, you'd want them to continue patronizing your business, but I guess they're too good for that now. It's a shame, because the food is delicious, but customer service has to improve.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Blue C.,"Best Thai I've ever had, uh seriously. And I don't say that lightly- I've lived places where I know better- wowza.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stacy Y.,Decent Thai food in the core DT area! If you go in right at 5pm when its first open you don't need to wait in line! Good atmosphere and friendly servers!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amber T.,"This is for the ridiculous bar policy. I had placed an order for pick-up, which was not ready yet so I opted to go to the bar for a seat and a drink. Instead of taking my drink order or directing me to the front to be counted, the bartender stated only dine-in customers can sit at the bar. Mind you, I had placed a $60 pick-up order, this was one corner seat at the bar that had been open for 20 minutes while I was waiting and I would have easily dropped another $40-50 easy at the bar. What's the difference of my one seat when there were 4 other people who had been sitting there drinking after their meal. Don't forget where you started because this experience left a sour taste and if I could, I would have cancelled my food order.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shaun C.,"Simply put, the food at Pai is amazing & full of flavour! We ordered the grabong which is a vegetarian deep fried battered squash fritters with garlic tamarind dip with nuts, which was perfect. Also tried the chicken wings which were just ok, but to be fair it's not a specialty. Absolutely loved the Khao Soi signature dish with its creamy coconut milk curry, egg noodles and tender beef. The dish also includes crispy egg noodles too that become engulfed into the broth like passengers of a sinking ship. Shorty got the pad gra prow with chicken which she enjoyed very much. We also ordered the milk tea which was delicious as it was refreshing. Best Thai restaurant ever!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maria C.,"One of the rare Thai restaurants to offer Beef Massaman on their menu and it is highly recommended. Their chicken satay melts in your mouth. It gets quite busy but when you are finally sitting down at a table, the service is quick and very friendly. Will definitely go back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nate Y.,"3.5 star for Pai, 
my expectations were high for this place..
what can i say..  food was good.  tastes just like sukhothai and sabai sabai .. because the menu was created by chef nuit.. 
environment was unique.. presentation is nice for some of the dishes like the curry served in a coconut..  they even give you the left over curry that they cant fit into the coconut which was nice.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivian L.,"Very nice and extremely busy place. I have no complain about the food. Only they don't take reservation, wish they accommodate that in the future.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Derek R.,"Probably one of the best Pad Thai places in the city. Ambiance is excellent, wait staff are attentive and the food is perfect. Highly recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anne-Marie M.,"Pai is a lively spot on Duncan Street that focuses on dishes from Northern Thailand - the restaurant is named after the town of the same name north of the city of Chiang Mai. That means less emphasis on coconut-based curries and more on spicy ground meat dishes like laab and pad gra pow. If you want to taste just how nuanced Thai food can be (as opposed to simply being sweet), please go to Pai and order the laab salad or pak boon fai deng (morning glory wraps) or the classic northern Thai curry - Khao Soi. The flavours are complex, aromatic and as hot as you choose to handle.
The atmosphere is loud and busy, but not overbearing. The servers are friendly and fast. If you've ever been to Thailand, you'll feel at home in this place - it's decor reminds me of any number of charming bars, cafes and restaurants I visited when I travelled there.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ben C.,30 minute wait in a little slow service but the place was packed. it's interesting it's a bar and a Taiwanese restaurant put together.   Good atmosphere friendly staff,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dustin V.,"Food here is great, definitely one of the best spots for Thai in Toronto. The vibe is hip and the decor is cool. The only drawback is that this place gets very busy. Had an incident where I waited up to 45 mins for my meal, but they did take it off the bill, so the customer service is definitely there.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Avik S.,Best Thai food in town. One of the downside is long waiting time even during the weekdays.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rakash S.,"Pai hosts a nice warm, vibrant atmosphere. Would highly recommend making a reservation or at least going an hour in advance to book your spot. As mentioned in other posts place gets busy, I went on a Wednesday evening place was packed. 
Cause of time I was offered to have my dinner at the sitting level. You sit on the ground on the upper level stage. Accompanied by carpet on the ground and pillows. It was cool and unique but didn't last long. Over time it gets a bit uncomfortable. But my biggest annoyance is that everyone can see you. I don't eat like a pig or anything but just a low key type of guy lol. 
In terms of the menu, all your favourite Thai options are here. Fried shrimp ( ordered a second round ), fried rice, pad Thai, green curry, red curry, etc... The quality and the portions are great, especially for the price. Vibrant colors and flavors. The Curry's were not too thick and not too watery. Best part these guys know spice. When they say hot its hot. If your not a avid spicey eater would suggest starting off mild or normal.
Overall great place, would highly recommend if your going with friends, casual, date, etc etc. Great service. Just remember to book in advance. And try to avoid the sitting area, unless you do yoga on a regular. Even if you end up there the food makes up for everything.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kat A.,"LOVE IT! Great place. We were at an art show across the street and so we thought we'd end the night at Pai! Reminded me of Thailand so much. Very nice and cosy, looks like a good place to spend an evening with friends or your partner. 
Food portions are out of control - so good! We had the Khao Soi and the Pad Thai. Service was good. Very loud in here and dark, so if ya don't wanna see your companion's face, then go here. haha, but really, great good. You can easily order one entree and have leftovers for lunch the next day.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jay L.,"My second experience at Pai was great on a few fronts.  This place is quite popular on weekdays and weekends so for big groups, a reservation is a must.  By the time our group of 10 left, there was a line up the stairs and just at the door.
The service staff were friendly and swift with taking our orders and the kitchen staff was just as quick to bring the food to our table all at the same time.  :-)
I like the street market atmosphere that they are trying to bring to the space in the restaurant.
My favourite points of the meal were:
1. the deep-fried squash fritters (the grabong) were crunchy and lightly fried and also tasted sweet like a sweet potato.  It was great even without the garlic tamarind dip which provides some more savoury flavours.
2. this was the first time I had khao soi and I think I will want to come back to have more in the future.  The noodles had the right bite to hold up against the spicy and creaminess of golden curry.  Bonus: ask for a container to bring the soup home if you want to enjoy it with some rice for lunch the next day!
3. the thai milk ice tea is preferred over the lemongrass ice tea since the lemongrass is so subtle that I could barely detect it next to the stronger flavour of the thai milk ice tea.
Only small issue is the lack of coat hooks for the larger tables that use stools instead of chairs.  There is no convenient hook or coat stand nearby for guests at those tables.
Till next time.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rich V.,"Magically delicious! This is the most fun Thai restaurant I've ever been to, and the food was some of the best too. Had the Starter Soup and Khao Soi. Soup was bright, full of flavor. Has a nice slow heat. Khao Soi was with braised beef, incredibly rich curry that has intense flavor developed in it, delicious noodles, and if you like it hot add all the spice. Will definitely need to make this a frequent stop to try more goodness.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J C.,"Delicious and well worth the wait! Our entire party was happy. The food is flavorful, spice can be adjusted, and the portions are generous. While you wait, the cocktail selection will make the time pass quickly. They turn the tables over quickly so we didn't have to spend a lot of time waiting for our food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shannon S.,We came for lunch and ate at the bar. Great service. The house sangria was so good! My boyfriend had a beer and switched to sangria after trying mine. We started with the wing appetizer - good sauce. We shared the Pad Gra Prow with pork and the Khao Soi with braised beef. The Khao Soi was incredible! We both ate way past full because we couldn't get enough of the broth. Highly recommend.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy W.,My family has Thai roots + I've been to Thailand twice for a month each time so I can truly say that this place serves authentic Thai food. Expect to wait a bit for your seat but just know it's W O R T H it.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,C S.,Pai is a go-to for amazing Thai food. Their Khoa Soi and Fried Rice are always delicious and so so well prepared. The curries are also amazing. Love the new Etobicoke location!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aastha S.,"Was my first time there with a bunch of girlfriends. We ordered the spring rolls, fritters and the chicken satay. Some of us also got the Thai iced tea! The apps were really good and authentic. I loved their sauces. For mains I ordered the green curry with tofu and veggies. It came in a young coconut, with steam rice. The portions were fairly decent but the flavour of the green curry wasn't something I have not had before, so I would say it was good. We didn't wait too long to be seated (10 min or so) and the service with food was pretty good too. Overall a good vibe and fun place to hang out! Can be a bit loud, so be aware of that.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,A F.,"Incredible food, beautiful place. Make a reservation as it is always super busy. A great place to take visitors from out of town as it's a unique gem of Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cail B.,"It's a great place to go for Thai food, definitely a Toronto 'hot spot' -even on a Wednesday it seems to be a steady flow of traffic. I do find all the foods very heavy but could've been our choices; squash fritters basically like sweet potato fries (hard to mess up but, I was expecting more of a Patti for some reason) spring rolls (just meh), I don't eat chicken wings but the rest of my party said they wouldn't order them again, pad thai with chicken was good, crispy Pork with a fried egg on rice (wouldn't order again) and the green coconut curry with beef was the saving grace had a bite too it and was presented beautifully. I'll be back but prefer it as a take out place when you just want to be lazy.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Martin H.,Way too sweet. This is the worst and most over priced Thai food I have ever had. Do 99 percent of people have terrible palletee?,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tina L.,"Visiting Toronto and I bookmarked this place so long ago seeing all the reviews and all. 
Entered the place and thought wow it's so cute! Waited 25 mins got seated and figured out that the khao sai was sold out with chicken and beef just tofu and shrimp :))))))) went for shrimp. It was good! The curry was delicious. Everything else fell real short. Papaya salad- below average. My mother who isn't Thai makes better Papaya salad. Pad Thai- eh I've had better in LA. The rice plate was ok.
It was snowing, and I didn't realize that you can't park upfront without a permit. Got a parking ticket :))) In conclusion, this was an average thai joint for me on the high end in my wallet(with the ticket)",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alice L.,I love tge deep fried squash and the green curry served in a young coconut.  The phai thai is also amazing.   I highly recommend to make reservation as the place always busy,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lynn C.,"I've been here a couple of times now and I definitely will be a returning customer for a while. 
I came on for lunch and another time to get a grab and go meal and I'm always been satisfied by the overall customer service and food.
It's fairly new to me the type of cuisine but I'm falling in love.
Their pad Thai are great and also tried one of their beverages that one of my co-worker was talking about several times so I had to try it.
Definitely a place for me saved on my book marks.
Recommended, thanks guys.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie C.,Great food! A bit on the pricey side and the atmosphere is a bit chaotic due to a high volume of people in the restaurant plus loud music but the service was good and overall I really enjoyed my meal.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,somi b.,This review is on totally about ice tea. Are you kidding me? Half of the drink is ice. Asked for less ice and the drink was served in a smaller glass. Crazy. This is for nearly $6 drink.,2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nash K.,"Great ambience combined with great food. Give this place a stop on your next trip to Toronto. Their portion size,  food quality and taste are good. Place gets packed so make sure you give plenty of time to get seated",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael K.,We had to wait a bit but the food was excellent. The atmosphere was a little noisy but all in all a great place to grab some good food.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sha M.,"This place is the best. Arguably the best Thai food in the city. Service can be very busy, but it is always worth the wait! 
I've ordered in house and take out and both services are excellent!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lotta P.,"Not sure what the hype is all about! The service was pretty friendly but the food was average at best. I'm from Northern Virginia and the thai food scene is very strong in the DC metro area. That said, except for one of the beef curries, nothing was great. In fact, the pad thai, which is pretty standard and most place do well, was probably the most forgettable I've ever had. 
In all, we ordered 5 dishes: veggie pad thai, beef khao suey, beef masumassen curry, shrimp fried rice and shrimp ka prow (which is one of the dishes they're known for). The curries and ka prow had good flavors but again, nothing spectacular. The other two dishes not so much. One factor could be that we did takeout and sometimes food tastes better when you dine-in and you eat it piping hit right as it hits your table. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars.l - benefit of the doubt. Also because it doesn't have an extensive menu. But most importantly, if you're a thai restaurant and you DON'T have kee mao (drunken noodles) on the menu, you're a pretender!!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yue Z.,"Very busy even in the early evening, around 5:30 pm. My friend and I waited for 10 minutes to be seated. Waitresses were welcoming. Inside the restaurant there are more than 20 tables, and they were all occupied when we arrived. Given such circumstances, 15 minutes waiting for the dishes to be served was not a long time, and foods were great. I ordered a beef with green curry, medium spicy. The beef was tender and the taste of curry was rich. I mixed the curry with jasmine rice and finished it all. Definitely will come back again and recommend it to my friends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rita S.,"Followed the yelp reviews to this cute place. Very busy and doesn't take reservations, but the weight wasn't long. Had the soups, spring rolls, wings and split a panang curry. Easily the best Thai I ever tried, and Thai is my favorite food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Peter V.,"Authentic Thai. 
Really enjoyed the food here it tasted very similar to the food we had in Bangkok. Over all very tasty and definitely one of the best Thai places in Toronto",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bara R.,The best Thai Resturant in Toronto. One of my favorite places to go to whenever I'm in Toronto. The atmosphere is great. Service is super fast. You won't regret going there,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anne Z.,"Restaurant was busy when we got there but we were able to be seated right away for a group of 6!
Kind of wished I had tried some other dishes. I had the Tom Yum soup (the entree) and it came in a large pot with a bowl of rice. The soup was quite good but the price was quite high for an entree of soup.
Will definitely try some of the other signature dishes next time but the soup was pretty decent and the service wasn't too bad.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ran C.,"Came here on a whim one summer night and left very pleased. In my opinion, this is very comparable to Khao San Road with slightly lower prices. As usual, I ordered my favorite thai dish, Khao Soi. The quality is very comparable to Khao San with exception to the viscosity of the curry, which was made noticeably less thick at Pai. My only other complaint (which really shouldn't even be a complaint) is that that there were an overwhelming amount of beef compared to noodle and personally, I prefer to have balanced ratio of each.
Not to mention, the resto has a very cool and hip vibe with enthusiastic servers, which is always a bonus. Pai is your best bet for thai food if you want to skip the line for Khao San Road.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nichole M.,"Delicious food, great drinks and fun atmosphere. We had lunch here and it was one of the busiest places we've eaten at in town.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ruth S.,Everything I ordered from Pai was excellently cooked and prepared. The service was exceptional. I came in on a Friday night with a group of friends and had anticipated an hour line up which turned out to be less than half hour wait! The staff does well in giving their all to provide their customers a great experience. Be sure to try their beef green curry!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Helen Z.,"the host there is so nice and polite, she kept answering whoever cut in the line who arrived after us and keep telling us one minute. It just ruined my day!",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Baby B.,"Maybe I didn't try the right things but this place doesn't do it for me. I believed the hype and was let down. The mango drink is yummy but we had the spring rolls, tom yum soup, pad gra prow and gaeng kiaw wan (served in a coconut). Don't get me wrong, the food was good but there is definitely better in the city.
It is charming that they name their drinks after the Raptors (Toronto forever!)",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nikolina V.,"There's a great vibe, lots of space and I've always been impressed by the food. Would recommend this to anyone looking for great Thai (-and not just pad thai)!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arianna R.,"I've been wanting to try this place for about 2 months ! I had high expectations about it !! Let's say expectations were meet food is good something to remember the green curry is creamy and full of flavour but not heavy spring rolls are fresh and flavourful even though are fried , hot sauce is not your average sriracha is a beautiful slightly salty Chili oil , and best part the place is so hip and different from your regular Thai restaurant , prices are average and quality is there , make reservations ahead place is always packed",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shirin A.,"The food was amazing, the place was very well decorated, the service was good. The only thing we can complain about that was the menu. It was hard to read with some thai food name and long descriptions. If they add pictures to their menu then it would be easier to find the favarite food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex J.,"I really do feel like this place is overrated, when judging off of the food alone. While it is great inside and in a fantastic location, with great service. I found the food at Nana and Khao San Road to be more ""authentic""/similar to what you would taste in Thailand (I've been a few times) and overall with more flavor. The green curry I ate here seemed watery and without much flavor or enough saltiness.
Still, a good spot to eat good Thai food!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bryan P.,"Great food and great atmosphere.  
The food was oh so good.  Good amount of choice without feeling too overwhelmed.  One type of pad Thai one type of curry.  Both so amazing.  I did not order the food but everything I ate was good.  They had 5 different spice levels and we got mild as ordered family style so had to suit everyone's taste.  Just ask for the chilli oil on the side if you want to turn up.  
The place was packed at 7pm Thursday night, understandable but they had no waiting area at all.  There were about 25 people jammed packed at the front and the stairs.  Made it awkward to say the least.  
Overall I'm very happy to try this place.  Will be back.  Only problem is deciding here or ksr",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeb H.,"Food ****1/2
Service ****
Ambience *****
What can I say?  After wanting to go for more than a year, we stumbled upon an open reservation on a snowy Friday night. Really good decision",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Conor H.,"I love this restaurant, I have very few negative things to say about it, on a couple of occasions I have accidentally ordered the wrong thing and gotten another spectacular dinner. The lines can be a drag, however they generally move pretty well as long as your there before 7:30pm.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alisha M.,"Great Thai, some of the best in Toronto. Having lived in Australia and been to Thailand I find it hard to be satisfied with Thai food. However these guys nailed the pad Thai (no sign of ketchup here thank goodness) and the Massaman Beef Curry.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pikster B.,"Cute place, and good food. 
We ordered the green curry with shrimp which was served in a coconut (*extra brownie points) and the coconut jasmine rice.   The green curry was sweet, not too spicy, and had a perfect consistency.  Along with the jasmine rice cooked in coconut milk this combo is a must try (i know it sounds like i'm going nuts - and excuse the pun- but this is a must have since it marries so well with the curry flavours and the coconut flesh that you can scrape out during the meal)  
The only downsides to this place is its popularity!  We had to book the restaurant at 9 pm and it was still packed (and if you are trying to catch up with old friends or keen for a personal conversation this may not be the place since it does get noisy) 
However, a very good choice for thai food in the city :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Asiya K.,Waited 45 minutes to be seated.. was definitely worth the wait. Food was delicious and was well sized. The pice was reasonable but we went as a group of 6 and we were charged 20% service charge which made the bill expensive. Overall the food was great and had a good ambiance,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David X.,"Over-rated would be an understatement.  Let's not discuss the fact the food was 45 min late...yeah I know, this is not even fine dining.  When we got the food, you can tell it has been sitting there for at least 5 min because the curry on top was coagulated and thickened already with a layer of film.  Staff was not attentative and when we asked for water for the table of 6, I couldn't believe the attitude and the scoff.  When we also asked for separate bills, we had to negotiate to do maximum 4 for the table even though they were clearly doing more than 4 for the table over.  Oh and let's not forget the 20% auto tip for large groups...last I checked, gratuity was a sigh of great service.  I guess since they are the fad of the month, they can afford to treat people like crap.  Ps: saw a small dead mouse in the washroom stall too...juat saying",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Albert Y.,"I live very close to this place so I've done a number of take aways and never disappointed with the food.
While I've never been to Khao san road myself (since they do not take reservations), people used to say Khao san road was closer to authentic Thai food. It's unfortunate that place closed down.
This place isn't the brightest lit place but you can still make out the menu and can be rowdy, but maintain a conversation with someone across the table without losing your voice.
Their reservations can be ridiculous so if it's for a special occasion you may have to book at least a month or two in advance or get there much earlier than intended time to eat.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Antwoine J.,If you love curry come here! The green curry is amazing and it has a little spice to it so I'd say go for pleaseeeeeeee,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica T.,"been going to the original khao san road (now kiin) - since inception! Jeff and his wife and the sweetest, always says hi when he sees me! have  been coming to PAI for years now and i will continue to! PAI is one of my top recommendations for anyone visiting the city, it's also a regular spot for my friends and me. 
depending on my appetite and how many of us there are, we usually start with the squash fritters! they are a must, lightly battered and deep fried, service with a sweet and spicy sauce (you can ask for peanut free, if allergic). the thai chicken wings are a flavour-blast as well, just hate when dishes come in odd numbers, cause i always have to fight for the last one. it's hard to perfect wings, but chief Nuit definitely spent her time, i remember sitting at the bar when she was still testing the wings and Jeff offered me one, but i was simply too stuffed - needless to say i was very excited when it become a regular on the menu!
for entrees, it's always a dilemma for me between the pad gra pao and the street style pad pad. the pad gra pao is actually very easy to make, but hard to get the flavours/sauce right. it's one of my favourite dishes here - while the pad thai is without a doubt one of the best in Toronto. i've been to Thailand and back, can definitely say we have amazing Thai food in Toronto. their green curry, served in a coconut, is also one of my favourite curries in the city! i've also been here for a set menu, for a birthday. i believe it was $35/person, we of course, ordered alcohol. there were 2-3 apps and 3 entrees, PLUS desserts. needless to say we all left extremely satisfied and some with take out, highly recommend. i love coming with a big group or even up to 4 people - always us to order everything simultaneously. 
i have yet to try kiin, but definitely had heard great things! will probably go try it soon. 
definitely a must try for anyone who hasn't been and a regular spot for all locals.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rodrigo C.,"Despite the 45-minute wait for a table due to how busy Pai can get, the experience was definitely worth it with delicious food and great drinks.
The Pad Thai was stellar (FYI: medium level of spicy is bearable and enjoyable for someone who doesn't usually eat food that's too spicy)
Would definitely go back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kalisha H.,"The cocktails here are absolutely delicious. The food was pretty good but we were definitely expecting a larger menu, especially at a thai restaurant. They only have about ten dishes on the menu. It's very busy and has a huge hipster vibe. Probably wouldn't go back for the thai food, as I've had better, but would definitely get another cocktail.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kathy H.,"I have officially visited Pai Northern many many many many times now. Khao San Road has been delicious but it's small and packed. Pai Northern is a different story.
The seating is comfortable. Service is quick and fantastic. Staff will actually notice you and check on you. The green curry comes in a coconut. Definitely ask to pack and take it home with you!
The squash fritters are delicious. But my favourite squash fritters are from Dubai Dubai. 
I always order the Khao Soi noodles, the golden curry with noodles. Yummmmmm yum yum. I just cannot get enough of it! I've had other curry as well, all are flavourful it's like BEAUTIFUL. A+ curries!!! 
Pad thai was ""okay."" My favourite pad thai is up north in Minden, Ontario.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristine S.,Pai is my go-to Thai restaurant in Toronto. My usual order of pad gra prao never fails me. During peak times be prepared to wait if you haven't made a reservation; but IMO it's worth the wait!  Service is fast and the serving staff are extremely friendly.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nora N.,"Figured I should update this review. There are more veg options now! The food is tasty but not as tasty as it used to be (possibly because Chef Nuit's personal touch is most likely now at Kiin). I enjoy the Pai Market in the back at lunch time, but I wish the veg option sometimes would include curries and not just always some stir fried type of veg dish.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason T.,"My favourite Thai place in the city. I love the Gaeng Hunglay Ox Tail and Khao Soi.
Most of the time I'm ordering in via Uber since I don't live close to the restaurant but I do like going in as well since the vibe and feel of the restaurant is great as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sophie C.,"I am a huge fan, I think the curry was very good. The curry was a bit sweet but there is a hint of spice. It was incredibly rich and my partner's favourite aspect about the curry is that the noodle was both cripsy and moist. I think this restaurant is definitely worth the wait. The drinks were quite good too :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael P.,"Food was delicious and staff was courteous. Portion size is ample and price is fair.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bo Y.,"I had been there a number of times. Food is good and the atmosphere is vibrant. My last time there, I tried for the first time their Tom Yum soup. The taste was a bit different and both my mom and I got sick after. We both had the soup and my dad was fine but he did ordered something different. 
Overall a good restaurant and I hope that was just one incident.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle K.,"First time there. Went on Friday at 12:30 for lunch. Had to wait 1/2 hour for a table. 
Papaya salad- delicious. Would order this again! 
Pad Thai w shrimp - best I've had in Toronto. 
Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup - very tasty! Would be even better if it was less spicy.
Coconut sticky rice with mango - a bit too sweet & the mangos are out of season so it's just ok. Should put the sauce on the side so u can add the amount of sweetness you want. Overall not as good as in Thailand but good for Toronto. 
Service was very good.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie C.,"One of my go-to places for a Friday/Saturday night.
The food is consistently good - I get the grabong squash fritters and vegetarian pad thai every time.
Ambiance is equally as good - it is loud and busy, which I think is the best atmosphere for a casual drink (or two) with friends or even a date. 
There's a coziness to Pai that I adore, with rustic decor and vintage ornaments randomly strung around the restaurant.
Be prepared to wait up to an hour during peak dinner time, but it's well worth the wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessie Z.,"This is the best Thai food I've ever had! My mom and I came here for dinner and got the papaya salad and green curry with fish. The papaya salad is served in a deconstructed way. The star of the show was definitely the green curry that was served in a coconut. You could also scrape off the coconut meat and eat it with the curry, it's absolutely delicious!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rob B.,"One of the best Thai restaurants I've eaten at in TO. 
My gf and I ate: Kah Soi which was a chicken curry noodle dish, papaya salad with crab and morning glory (green shoot vegetables). 
The Kah Soi was FANTASTIC. Such a nice rich curry flavored sauce/soup almost. The papaya salad was delicious and nicely spicy. The morning glory was a nice refreshing change to what can often be a bit of a boring dish.  It was nicely seasoned with shrimp paste and garlic. 
Love this place. Will def go back. 
(We ordered delivery)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris N.,Best Thai in Canada hands down. I just spent 2 weeks in Thailand and the food here is on par with the best places we went on our trip,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Snowflake S.,"I would like to say I'm bit of a Pad Thai snob. Chef nuit pad thai is really good. I've had both the chicken and shrimp versions. I subtracted one star because ""mild"" is definitely NOT mild. It's more like medium to hot. Pai needs to work on their spice scale.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nupur N.,"This is hands down one of my most favourite places to come to for Thai food. I usually get the green curry and the squash fritters which are to die for. I promise that you can pick anything on their menu and you will not be disappoint! The only con of this place is the line up. Whether it's a weekday or a weekend, there's always a line up. So plan ahead!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,AK B.,"Although the wait was long (50mins) the food and service were worth it. My bf and I were recommended this place by a friend and we absolutely fell in love (we're obsessed with Thai food) the wait was long, so I recommend making a reservation. However, within the wait time we walked around and I stopped at a store on Queen street. 
We ordered the chicken skewers & spring rolls as appetizers.. THE BOMB 
And for mains, pad Thai for me and khao soi for my bf.
The waiter was great too! 
The ambiance was lively and very 'hip'",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Donnie I.,"We came here on Saturday night and it was super busy. We waited half an hour outside. I thought the place was small but apparently, they have a lot more room in the back. The place is dimly lit with chairs that don't make one another. I felt like it was a bit random and kind of hipster-ish.
The girls said this place was very good. One ordered the tom yum soup while the other ordered the khao soi. Both their dishes were very flavourful. The soup was a combination of sweet, salty, sour and spicy. It was extremely flavourful. The beef in the khao soi was tender and delicious.
Prior to those dishes, we ordered the butternut squash appetizer. I loved it. Great flavour since it's battered with red curry. Tasted great even without the dipping sauce.
As my main, I ordered the beef salad with farang spiciness level. It was quite spicy but delicious. The steak was cooked to perfection, slightly charred on the outside and red/pink on the inside.
Will come back eventually even though I rarely come downtown.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linz P.,Really fun and quirky atmosphere with some really great northern Thai food. You have to try the squash fritters! So tasty and great spot to have a chill night with friends.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ada L.,It's so busy for a good reason: everything is wonderfully delicious at Pai. My favourites are their curries - I just can't have enough of them! Be sure to reserve if you are a large party at least a week in advance to avoid disappointment.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexis G.,Favourite Thai in Toronto. Superb food from classics all the way to more traditional. Drinks are really good as well,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chantaya K.,"For Thai food, this #1 place to go! Service, prices, food and music all Great!! Free Wifi! The space is very welcoming chill vibe! Loved it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Being H.,"Favourite Thai place hands down. 
More spacious than meets the eye. Always packed. 
Been here several times only had one bad experience with a terrible hostess. Other than that it's fantastic.
The grabang fritters!? A must try. I get it. Every. Single. Time. 
You can sub almost anything on their menu to make it vegan. I get the pad thais or khao soi vegan. Delicious.
If I decide to be vegetarian and add the egg, still tasty.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nava L.,Delicious food and fun decor but the wait time is always a pain. Would especially not recommend going here during TIFF.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael C.,Great bartender/server made an excellent cocktail and very good entree of ground pork.  The killer was coconut sorbet for dessert- YUM!  A bit overpriced and more trendy than anything else.  More for the 'happening' crowd rather than true diners.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael H.,"Awesome food!  My new addiction, it's a must stop food spot when I go downtown.  Great service, and delicious food!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,shelli f.,"I just walked 30mins to Pai and back to pick up your delicious Shrimp Pad Thai..only to return home and find ""CHICKEN"" pad Thai in my take out container",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa C.,"Great food, great atmosphere! Food is reasonably priced here and comes in large portions. The restaurant is bustling and a little loud so you'll have to lean in to hear the conversation. Service is a little slow but friendly.
I ordered the Pad Thai and the thai iced tea, both of which were very good! The noodles were chewy and had a nice sweet and sour tang. 
Parking is pretty much non-existant, so your best bet is either street parking or finding a flat-rate parking lot. Oh, and be prepared to wait a while if you don't have a reservation!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hilary C.,Pai is one of my favorite restaurant. I went there for my birthday and I love the decoration there. Good for groups! Their Tom Yum Kung is a must-try item! It surprises me with their flavor coz its acidic taste really embraces my appetite! I cannot stop eating it! Definitely go again. Tips - make reservation! Or go earlier because this place is super crowded.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mel C.,I like this place. I really do. The good is tasty and lots of variety. But. It's very tight. Very cramped. Noisy and you feel somewhat rushed. The staff is so busy they don't help you in deciding what to order. Rarely check on customers after orders are placed. It's not a good dining experience. They are resting on popularity and don't seem interested in bettering themselves. For that reason I say look around for more Thai choices.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,jeri g.,"I had tried to eat at Pai twice before finally getting a table on the third try. 
It was worth the wait! We found ourselves hungry and around the corner from Pai 5 minutes before they opened. When we arrived 10 minutes later, I was very surprised to see almost the whole restaurant full. They appear to take reservations and I would for sure recommend making one. 
I had green curry with tofu and vegetables. It's served in a coconut which is visually very appealing, but the amount of food is too much to fit in a coconut so you get a side bowl filled with curry to go along with it. I was wondering how much of the $17 price tag for the dish goes into the cost of the coconut and the labour required to open it (I suppose they could use the water for the cooking?) 
We were in the area that's packed with two top tables and I had to ask the person being me a few times to move forward to that I could fit my (slim) body into my seat and then get my coat onto my chair. 
The staff was friendly and knowledge. The food was really good. Other than being overly packed in, I think it was a really great dining experience.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,foodie k.,Love this place and the vibe! Super casual and everyone is super chill. Great food and cocktails,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dom L.,"Bottom line: great food a lil on the pricer side for the portion 
Food is great here, incl my favourite item kao soi beef. Altho the price is higher and quantity is smaller compared to my other favourites khao San road and sukhothai. 
Also I feel that they are rushing you out when you are done eating. Not so great if you want to sit down and has a relaxing chat. The sukhothai on Dundas west is your best bet for a dinner and chat kinda good time 
Solid 3.5 star in the heart of Toronto.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sahara M.,"Loved this Thai restaurant - chicken, veggie and beef dishes were all excellent. Atmosphere is fun and loud. Great Thai drinks too. Highly recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Farid E.,"Some of the best Thai I've had! Of the places I've tried, the best non-tapas style Thai in Toronto.
- The Grabong is a great starter. Fried squash fritters with a very nice dip. Tasty.
- For mains I've had the Khao Soi, Gaeng Kiaw and Pad Thai. None of them disappoint.
- Coconut juice tasted fresh.
Service is normally pretty good. Welcoming staff is friendly, especially the guy who's usually there.
Unlike Khao San Road (also amazing), these guys take reservations. Big bonus!
Only negative thing is it does get pretty loud in there, we had to shout to talk to one another.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shahid K.,"Awesome food 
Good staff
Nice 
We ordered two Thai milk ice tea, two curries (which we always order) and Pai sausage plate for the first time. Both of us thought the sausages tasted a bit suspicious(it was sticky and raw), but none of us could tell why....  I hope the management of PAI finds out the reason",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Avery H.,"I've been visiting Toronto for about two weeks now, but Pai's Khao Soi dish is so far the most tasty dish I've had since I've been here. The curry broth is mild and unctuously rich in the best way possible with creamy coconut flavor that perfectly soaks the noodles. I took mine with the braised beef which came out delightfully tender and delicious. Service is pleasant, prompt, and attentive. There's no way I can ask for more from Pai! Wonderful food, wonderful experience!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda C.,"I have a big crush on Pai, and I can safely say it's my new Thai fave in Toronto. The first time I came here with 2 guy friends and we literally ordered 75% of the menu (2 of us had just run a marathon, so can you really blame us??). The servers were super helpful with their descriptions and recommendations. 
Some of the dishes I've tried:
- Moo Ping (grilled pork skewers) - pork was super tender 
- Sai Au Platter (big platter of pork belly sausage, sticky rice and diff fragrances that you mix together) - would have liked more sauce to it, but it's really different than anything else I've tried!
- Chef Nuit Pad Thai - pretty good from what I remember 
- Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup - the broth is quite spicy and bold in flavour 
- Green curry in coconut - delicious, it was my fave, and loved the novelty of the coconut!!
- Crispy Basa Fillet - loved the 2 dipping sauces, a nice alternative to the usual beef, chicken, shrimp 
Only dessert was Mango sticky rice, which was OK. The 2nd time I went, they ran out of this. Would have liked to see more of a dessert selection. But probably not a huge drawback. I think I'd probably be too full for dessert most times I come here. 
I also love the fact that you can make reservations. I know part of the hype of going to certain non-reservation restaurants is that you get to wait for your food, and it's fair for everyone. Call me Type A, but I like to plan my day and my meals, so reservations work for me. 
Random side note: If you spend enough time in their washroom, you might actually learn a few Thai phrases! (There's a 'learn to speak Thai' soundtrack on loop, so random, but adds to the whimsy)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M N.,"Some of the best Thai food I've had! Very flavorful. 
I wish they had better choices of beer and that the noise level was lower. But that still doesn't take away from the excellent taste of the food",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Willem V.,"Truly great food - although not Thai spicy unless specifically asked. 
It's a busy place and seems somewhat geared towards processing speed to get another round of tables in. Service is detached - probably because it's busy all the time. Food is marvelous, did I mention that already?",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Febrian B.,"I tried their curry in coconut and asked for the spiciest level (Thai's spicy). I was quite underwhelmed because it was not as spicy as expected (despite the waitress asking multiple times if i was sure that I could handle it). Apart from lack of spiciness, it was a very delicious curry.
Then I asked for tom yum soup, asking for it to upgrade the spiciness even more. This time it was very spicy as I hoped. Despite its strong spiciness, other flavours were not overwhelmed. 
Overall, their dishes were very tasty. It was well prepared even though it was a very hectic Friday dinner hour. The service was very friendly and we were well attended despite high volume of customers.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adam G.,"man, mine place, but a major rip off!!! Don't go here if you're hungry. Portions are very small and over priced and service is very slow.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,E. G.,"Food here is rich, authentic, and bursting with flavour. I'm never disappointed when I come here. Definitely order the Thai iced tea.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason L.,"Went on a Saturday night around 9pm - packed, but the wait wasn't too long for 2 (about 20 minutes). We ordered the papaya salad, stir fried morning glory, ox tail curry, and fried basa fillets with rice. The food was good in taste, but it's your typical basic Westernized Thai food joint. The fish looked and tasted more like fish sticks, the ox tail curry was sweet without much other flavors, and the papaya salad was only tangy and salty (missing chili flakes, garlic, and fish sauce maybe). Overall, our meal was missing the complex and strong flavors that we have tasted many times in Thailand.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy L.,"I ordered Chang Mai beef noodle ""Thai spicy"" through UberEats and Takeout but they gave me ""Mild(No spice)"" TWICE!!! ! Also, I ordered ""extra chilli oil"" and they forgot TWICE.... I used to love this place so this is very sad and unacceptable. What kind of Thai food is it if there is no spice..I hope they improve their service.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nour K.,"Best thai place in downtown TO. It's packed most of the times, so I recommend you make a reservation. The vibe / atmosphere is cool, service is friendly, and food variety is appealing to all tastes. Had the coconut shrimp green curry and it was delicious, their pad thai is also very good, you may think it's basic, but flavours are great!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Farrell J.,"Not consistent although the queue during summer is insane. It's certainly the better Thai in Toronto but personally I prefer Nana. Still give it a go twice. Make sure I go early. The bar area is ready, cosy and waiting.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carman T.,"Literally the best Thai food in Toronto. It is not easy to get a table here, but the ambience is great, the food is amazing and the servers here are great! Prices are a little higher than you would expect for Thai food, but definately worth it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alison L.,"Always reliable for a good curry. And some coconut. Mm. My friend and I had just finished up a wine class at iYellow on Queen West and decided to try our luck for a table here on a Friday night. We were told a table would be roughly 20 minutes wait and decided to wait it out with a drink in the bar. 
I had to have one of the Thai iced teas. I was at Pai! If you've never had one, definitely get it. It's a large order. I never finish so I usually share with a girlfriend or something. 
We were offered two seats at the bar which was fine by us and got us food sooner rather than later. Service was decent. The staff checked up on us every so often (both behind the bar and the regular wait staff). 
I ordered the tofu pad Thai and my friend ordered the green curry in a coconut. The pad Thai wasn't spectacular but their curry was amazing as always. That definitely filled my Thai food craving for the next little while!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lusika G.,"Delicious, flavourful and so creative! The green curry in a coconut was DELISH! My first time at Pai, and it did not disappoint! Can't wait for my next visit!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jae T.,Always a pleasure eating here. Always a hard time making reservations or getting a seat here.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,X X.,"It's going to be a long wait and you'll probably get the curry which is similar to a bowl of water with coconut milk in it heated in a microwave. You'll probably ignore this review so have fun at Pai. But just remember, I told you so!",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yan Z.,I actually wanted to not like this place because of how much hype it gets. But the food is truly delicious and worth the wait. Recommend the padthai and curries,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joshua D.,I always come here 1-2 times a month and I almost always get the Pad Gra Prow with a side of Moo Ping! Very consistent and always amazing,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hari B.,Just fantastic food and reasonably priced considering its location.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ahren B.,"I luckily stumbled on this place after trying to take a friend to Khao San Road and discovering we would need to wait a long wait time. We walked around the block basically and stumbled into Pai. I instantly loved the atmosphere. It's this warm, inviting space in the basement of a nice old building. The lighting is right. Music is fun. Service is on point.
The Khao Soi is incredible. It's creamy, spicy, sweet, savoury. Everything good. Perfect for when you need some serious comfort food. The squash fritters are a great snack. The Khao Pla Tawt is some delicious light and tasty fried fish. 
I had a mango juice to go with everything and I just felt blissed out by food. This is place has great food with a great atmosphere. Check it out.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Baba B.,"Awesome Thai place.  Definitely for the young(er) crowd.  Little noisy and crowded.  The seating wait on a weekday without reservation was about 30 minutes.
We were five of us and had drinks and multiple dishes, all of which tasted awesome!
Despite the busy restaurant, the service was reasonable, we did have to wait for our server a couple of times for followup service, but nothing to drive one crazy.  The curries are heavenly.  They have a nice mix of drinks.
Reasonably priced too.
Definitely a repeat...and more.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yana L.,Amazing and flavorful food. Beautifully presented. Just an overall win. Brisk service. Do yourself a favor and eat here !,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie A.,"Had initially wanted to go to a different Thai place on Queen W called Nana (near T-B Park) and when we learned it was closed on Mondays we were devastated. Still craving Thai I yelped the nearest Thai spot and this gem popped up. I first fell in love with this restaurant when I looked at their oddly patterned step upon opening the door. The place, albeit darker than most as well as louder, had this inviting ambience that I believe comes from the flags hanging from the ceiling and assorted chairs. 1pm on a hot Monday and we were quickly seated. 
To those who enjoy caffeine, Pai's Thai Ice Tea is a MUST HAVE. Caffeinated drinks typically dry out my mouth but this kept me so refreshed, especially with the food if you like it spicy. 
We started out with the spring rolls which were piping hot. Pretty good! Rolls were STUFFED with filling and they didn't break as we bit into them. 
Friends ordered wings and Chef Nuit's chicken pad thai. Both good except the pad Thai I found to be hotter than expected. I had the medium heat chicken Pad Gra Prow and it was heaven. Medium spice gave it a nice warmth that didn't overpower the dish and the egg on top just brought everything together. Will definitely be coming back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Youssef E.,"Great food and great place, really packed, make sure to make reservation ahead of time or arrive earlier then expected. Servers were nice, informative, and the food came out hot and fresh",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karen C.,"Excellent food, but restaurant is very noisy. Not the best place to go if you're trying for a quiet date place, but is very fun.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ronald M.,"Pai is a great time. Food is tasty, cozy atmosphere to chat with your group, large space with lots of seating.
There are certainly better Thai restaurants and there are certainly cheaper Thai restaurants but you definitely can't go wrong here after a movie at Scotiabank Theatre.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeremy L.,This place always seems busy so it's probably best to go at non-peak hours. I had their chicken pad Thai and would say it's definitely one of the better ones I've tried. They give you a good amount of chicken and the portion is big enough to fill most people. The noodles were the right texture and the sauce was on point. Only thing I would change is there was a bit too much chive/coriander which over powered some of the other flavours. Also wish that the interior of the restaurant was a bit more practical as the seating arrangements aren't the best and there wasn't a good place to hang jackets. Overall I definitely think I would return and look forward to my next visit.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina L.,Coma in for catering do not order take out. It will take you two hours and no one will answer the phone,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vince V.,"One of my favourite Thai places in Toronto! I've been here a number of times, and the food is consistently awesome. The pad gra prow and pad thai are my favourites... Yummy, so savoury. And the spice chart is actually accurate, so the most spicy level is really spicy (I have a high tolerance to spice). The place is quite large inside, with many tables throughout, bar, and tables where you can sit cross legged on the floor. Atmosphere is very modern and hip, so it attracts a lot of people in 20s and 30s, but there is a good variety of people who come. Honestly a top notch Thai restaurant with traditional flavours and a modern twist!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kube Y.,This is for sure the best Thai place downtown. It's usually busy so there is always a lineup outside around lunch or dinner time. The restaurant is cute on the inside and they have amazing cocktails. I highly suggest the lemongrass Sake they have. My favourite thing to order here is Pad Thai and spring rolls.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Frances K.,"After one visit to Pai you will feel cheated by all the other restaurants that you've had Pad Thai from...
The hype around this place was too crazy to ignore so I decided to investigate myself. With the rumoured long wait times, my friend and I decided it would be best to make a reservation for dinner. She called the restaurant because the only times showing up on their online booking system were way too late, but they just suggested that we come before 6:30 to see if there were any free tables.
We rushed over right after work and to our surprise, we were seated the moment we arrived (TIP: try to go before 6:30 if you can because this is when swarms of people start coming in). Pai was bustling and the interior of the restaurant resembled a street market in Asia - super unique! Though my friend and I had some difficulty carrying a conversation because of how loud the place was, we didn't mind because of how excited we were to try out the food.
We ordered the Pad Thai and Beef Pad Gra Prow after having it suggested by two different people.
Anywho, now on to how they tasted... Let's just take some time to give a round of applause to Pai's cooks. They were both just DIVINE. WOW. Portion-wise, the dishes were not too large but were just enough to share between the both of us. 
The Pad Thai was the best I've ever had in my life. I think I can leave it at that. The fact that I thoroughly enjoyed the Beef Pad Gra Prow really surprised me (I practically licked the plate clean) just because I am not a fan of beef. Each bite, however, seriously packed a punch and it was so delicious.
CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tanya B.,"Good food and reasonable pricing. If you're OK to sit in a section that doesn't have liquor license, you can get a table right away.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grace K.,"Unique northern Thai food. Friendly staff and efficient service. Be mindful that you are forced  hear next table conversations.  Can get very noisy as a whole and theres no room to place your coat, bag etc. Other than that a great place to eat and hang out !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,chris s.,"Literally the best Pad Gra Prow with Crispy Pork I've had in my life- and I've visited Thailand multiple times. I was there on a work trip and Pai Kitchen was near the hotel I was staying at. I spent 2 nights in Toronto and both nights I ate at Pai- it was that good. I also had the Pad Thai and the Khao Soi, both of which were great and on the better side of other Thai restaurants I've been to, but ultimately forgettable. The Pad Gra Prow was lifechanging. Thinking about it right now makes me want to fly the 3 hours to Toronto so I can get my fix.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia D.,"Excellent food; noisy, casual ambiance - sometimes abysmally slow service so expect a longer than normal dinner and having to potentially flag your waiter down. Do it with a smile for your own nerves. 
Usually it's a 40 min + wait and I wouldn't suggest large groups attempt to go here without a reservation.
The food is reliably good Thai from the current masters of Thai food in Toronto.  Ambiance is nicer than Sukhothai on Wellington and equidistant from the financial district.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Abby B.,"This place was opened by the same people that started Khao San Road (my favourite Thai place in the city). Great food and space, but it gets very busy quickly. Also, it almost always takes them 30 mins to bring out the food so don't go if you're super hungry.
Also, make reservations! This place almost always has a line up, especially during lunch and for weekend dinner.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,May T.,"I went here for a late lunch (around 3pm) on a Saturday and it was packed! the wait was quick, only a couple of mins. I got the beef noodle soup and the person I was with got the noodles with yellow curry.
The waitress told us both our dishes were medium hot and we said okay.
The food was delicious! The yellow curry sauce was so creamy and tasty. my noodle soup filled my craving. The broth was so refreshing with the spices and lemongrass. My only disappointment was that medium hot isn't very hot for my taste. I will be asking for hot next time.
Overall a great dining experience. I've been here before and will be coming back. They also now do delivery!! which I'm pretty sure is new ish so I will be ordering from them more in future.",5

Pai Northen Thai Kitchen opened couple months ago, led by Chef Nuit- owner of Sukho Thai and Sabai Sabai. I immediately wanted to check out the restaurant when I heard that it is served family style AND they had papaya salad on the menu.
I've been to Thailand couple years ago and the dish I fell in love with was 'som tum', which is green papaya salad that is super light but so flavorful.
I dropped by for early dinner around 6pm with a friend and found the restaurant pretty empty. I immediately loved how they decorated the place, it was spacious and very laid back with bar seats around the restaurant.
Ordered: Papaya Salad with dried shrimp or salted crab 3/5
* Shredded green papaya, tomato, long green beans, garlic, red chili, tamarind juice, fish sauce, coconut sugar and freshly squeezed lime for $10
* It was light, refreshing and very citrusy
* Nice appetizer to start the meal but small in portion
* Served with cooked noodles and deep fried pig skin
* Green papaya is very crunchy and you can mix the noodles in to soak with the sauce
* Different vegetables within the salad added variety of texture which I really enjoyed
Ordered: Beef Salad 5/5
* Grilled beef cooked to medium with fresh lemongrass, mint leaves, long leaf corriander, kaffir lime leaves and shallots in a tangy lime sauce for $12
* This was one dish that I really enjoyed
* Grilled beef on top was very tender and it went really well with crunchy vegetables on the bottom
* Corriander and lime leaves added a lot of flavor
* Lime sauce didn't overwhelm any of the ingredients
Ordered: Gaeng Masaman with braised beef 4/5
* Braised beef in a peanut, tamarind curry with potatoes and topped with deep fried crispy shallots. (contains shrimp paste)
Served with steamed jasmine rice for $15
* You can choose the spicy level for all the dishes you order
* These dishes are served family style, good for sharing with friends and family
* Served with jasmine rice, it is a perfect dish for cold days like this
Summary: I really enjoyed my dinner at Pai Northen Kitchen. It was casual, home-style and bursting with flavor. They take reservation so make sure to give them a call because by the time I left, the restaurant was super busy. I really want to go back with more people and try some other dishes they offer.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cherine Z.,"Usually a long wait to get in, but the food is always great. The pad Thai is a big portion, so consider sharing and ordering another main to share if you want variety.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gwen Q.,"Love it here, except for the noise and waiting time. Is the waiting worth it? Well, unless you know another northern-style Thai restaurant, then I'm all ears!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sari R.,"As long-time, die-hard fans of Khao San Road, my boyfriend and I eagerly anticipated the opening of Pai. We had also recently visited Thailand, so visions of mangoes still danced in our heads. 
If you don't love the ambiance of Khao San Road (packed in like extremely loud sardines with a moustachioed hipster practically sitting in your lap), you'll enjoy Pai's spacious setup. The rusty Thai signs, homey carved wood and reggae music creates an entirely different feel. 
We shared the papaya salad which was appropriately spicy and served with chicharones and rice noodles. The portion was more than ample for sharing and was presented beautifully. My boyfriend had the Gaeng Hunglay as his main. Given the choice of oxtail and pork belly, he chose the former. Served with a bowl of rice and topped up with chopped chillies, he was one happy camper. I had the Pad Gra Prao with pork, which was divine. The presentation was a perfect stack with three components - rice on the bottom, pork in the middle and topped with a fried egg, Thai-style. Served with a little cup of nam pla and a stack of cucumber slices.  
Until this point I failed to mention that my boyfriend asked for a knife with his dish, and was informed that they did not have knives at the restaurant other than kitchen knives which they couldn't give him. We are very much aware that Thai food is usually just served with fork and spoon so this is perfectly acceptable. I have a feeling someone on Yelp will eventually complain about this, so let me inform you that when I see it on here, I will hate you for the rest of your hopefully short, meaningless life.  
I couldn't pass up an opportunity for mango with sticky rice for dessert. While the best I've ever had was undoubtedly at the Sukhumvit Soi 38 night market in Bangkok, we were extremely satisfied with the dish. 
Again, seriously ample portions, fantastic flavours, authentic details and two very happy tummies.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Devika A.,"I absolutely love PAI - I have visited Thailand a number of times and I would say food from PAI is super authentic ! They are always so great and accommodating when it comes to being vegan or vegetarian! Must orders - pad gra prow, morning glory (my favourite) , phad cha het for vegans (spicy mushroom dish). The spring rolls and squash fritters are great options for veggie appetizers ! :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Natalie B.,"Pai has over 50 reviews already? Okay, Toronto really loves Chef Nuit and her Thai dishes. I'm part of the masses here. Completely casual and fun atmosphere that welcomes people of all ages. 
To start share the squash fritters (aka grabong) with garlic tamarind sauce or the papaya salad. I'll try boo kem next time as I hear it's a standout dish. Khao soi - still a satisfying bowl of yes.
At this point I'm not super excited, but rather content and appreciative that the Regular duo continue to provide reliable and tasty Thai food with this new venture. I look forward to the introduction of more Northern Thai dishes in the coming months.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Janina L.,"Visited Pai Northern Thai Kitchen for the first time on August 22, 2017 (Tuesday) around 4:30pm with two of my friends. I have never heard of Pai before my friend recommended it, and I am so glad that she did! 
It was located very close to my workplace in the Financial District, so it was very accessible. About a 5-10 minute walk from St. Andrew Station. 
It was surprisingly very busy on a Tuesday late-afternoon! Our party of three was only able to get seats at the bar. Usually, I dislike sitting at the bar, but we were already here so I gave it a shot. 
We ordered the Grabong for $13 to split. Grabong is freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters lightly coated in red curry paste batter, deep fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with nuts. It was amazing - I highly recommend! The portion was also very large that all three of us had more than enough to get our fill of the dish. The bartender/waitress was also very accommodating as she gave us another dipping sauce to make it easier for us. 
For my main course, I ordered the Khao Soi with Braised Beef. It cost $15.5. I never had Khao Soi before, so there is really nothing I can compare it to... but it was to die for. The sauce was great, the noodles were cooked perfectly and the braised beef was so tender. It was a very big portion so I couldn't finish all the curry and the beef, but I savored every bite and tried to eat as much as I could. 
All in all, I would 100% come back and would recommend everyone to try this restaurant out at some point! 
The only thing I could recommend for them to improve is to increase the size of the restaurant and let more people enjoy your food!!!! Around 5:30 there was already such a long line of people waiting to get seated!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Annie T.,"- I have tried so many Thai restaurants, including Khao San Road, I have to say Pai is my favourite so far. What I have tried:
   + Chef Nuit Pad Thai: omg this dish is AMAZING, so much better than the one at Khao San Rd. It is the most flavourful pad thai I have ever tried. I got it with beef, but the meat came out a bit dry, I would recommend it with chicken or maybe pork. 
   + Gang Kiaw Wan in a coconut: basically green curry in coconut, I ordered it with fish since I never had curry with fish before. The curry was herby and so authentic. Other curries I have tried at different Thai restaurant are either salty or sweet. This curry gave a hint of coconut but not too strong, very savoury. The fish fillet was soft but there were not many pieces of fish :( 
   + Pad Gra Prow: I ordered this just because it's so popular on yelp. However I have to say this dish was the biggest disappointment out of all I have tried. It's just rice and minced pork with a side of fish sauce (not even better than rice with grilled meat from Vietnamese restaurant). The fish sauce was so tasteless, I think it's because not all people can endure the smell of it. The pork had ok flavour, overall nothing about this dish impressed me.
- Portion: HUGE omg, don't be fooled by my picture, one dish can fill one person up. My bf and I thought the portion would be the same as Khao San so we went for three dishes and had struggle to walk in the end
- Price: a bit more on the pricey side but it's worth it, trust me you need to give it a try, you won't be disappointed 
- Great and fast customer service. I reccommend to reserve the table on their website, otherwise you have to spend up to 1-2 hours lining up outside.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karim H.,"Beat Thai food in Toronto hands down. Great atmosphere and vibe, incredible food! I highly recommend the GRABONG for an app and the KHAO SOI for a main. Heaven.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley D.,I love their pad Thai it's one of the best downtown. Perfect ratio of sauce which is made with tamarind and not that gross ketchup flavour. You can also choose your spice level! Definitely recommend booking a table in advance as they can get very busy.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jonathan W.,"Currently the best Thai food in Toronto. These folks previously worked at Khao San Road and left to open Pai. It's more roomy and inviting here with the same high quality authentic food previously served at Khao San Road (chef Nuit). 
A few highlights include the best Tom Yum soup in the city. Sweet and sour never came in a better form. The soup got the approval of some folks who grew up with Tom Yum soup in Asia. Also, a phenomenally fragrant green curry, (gaeng kiaw wan) served in a coconut. Excellent flavor. These two dishes are must orders. 
The pad gra prao with crispy pork was solid and filling. A spicy gaeng hunglay with oxtail rounded out a fantastic meal. 
The papaya salad to start was interesting with a selection of DIY sides that spurs the appetite. 
Given the advantages in seating and atmosphere with the same tasty food, this is the best place satisfy your Thai food cravings.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,L ..,"When you go to pour your water, and the bottle starts tweeting like a bird, that's enough to make you feel like ""damn, I'm coming back here for sure"".
The food is loaded with flavour, and the presentation seems to be quite authentic - trust me, I've watched YouTube videos of Thailand, plus I've travelled there via Google Maps Street View, so I'm legit.
Try everything.
4/5",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kim C.,"If you like Khao San Road --- this is the same style of food (similar menu, taste, and dishes). I still love the Khao Soi noodles with the sauce - YUMMY! and I'll order their pad thai of course. 
This place definitely feels more ""bar-like"" or maybe even more romantic only cuz its so DARK inside! It seems a lot bigger  (maybe I'm wrong) but it just feels that way because its usually completely full and with a large lineup!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny N.,"Generally not bad, but how many times am I going to have to see this menu??
First Khao San Road, then Shabai Shabai, then Suhko Thai... now Pai??? I'm honestly so tired of these squash fritters, and the Khao Soi. Why does every place have the same damn menu??? This stuff was all so good a year ago, but now I'm just sick of going to each new location, hoping for something different and finding the same menu at each place. Everything was the same as every other Thai venture than this chain has undertaken, and each time I go to the next place, I find the sameness less charming. Am I boring you by being repetitive?
You get my point.
I don't know what I expected. Something different?
Edit: I thought it was only fair to actually give an account of my experience as well: The service was good. But they brought the pad Thai and the Khao Soi right after the fritters and there was no room on the table for our wine, wine glasses, water glasses and the food, itself. This is a pet peeve for me: If you're going to make me  sit at a tiny table, you'd better bring my food out in courses. Especially If I have a bottle of wine. I loved the whistling water bottle, but we had to keep it on the floor because there was no room.
Squash Fritters were not as light and crispy as I remember having at Khao San Road. Pretty greasy, actually. My friend ordered her Khao Soi Thai Spicy, but it was not. My noodles were really sweet. Everything was really just ok and unimpressive. I expected a lot more.  The Curry in a coconut looked cool. But felt a little gimmicky.
I think I'll stick with Khoa San Road.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mohammad M.,"Always great, always busy, always tasty. One of the top relaxed Thai experiences in the city.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gofran S.,"Love this restaurant! Great ambiance. Good service. Food is authentic! Ordered the pad Thai, fried rice and green curry. Perfect amount of spice.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Caitlin G.,"Amazing food and amazing staff. Wish I lived nearer so I could go regularly. Absolutely go if you want good Thai food or drinks or both. For reference, this is the only yelp review I've ever bothered to write but I had to write one for this place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melissa H.,Went here for lunch due to a Thai food craving. I had the pad Thai and wasn't all that impressed. The noodles didn't seem cooked well enough and everything was kind of a mush. I've had much better elsewhere. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff though!,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grayce Y.,"I am a huge fan of Khao San Road so I was sooooo excited about this addition to Toronto and to the Chef Nuit collection of Thai restaurants (note that she's no longer at khao san road). I have been looking forward to it so much that I dragged my sorority little sister with me one day. The vibe is very smiliar to Khao San Road: small tables, long wait time, a little bit cramped (if you don't mind eating elbow to elbow with a stranger & eavesdropping on their conversation or correcting their pronunciation of menu items) but an overall hipster vibe... my kind of place! 
We ordered the Green Curry (which comes in a coconut) and got it regular spicy as well as the squash fritters and also the Chef Nuit's Pad Thai (also regular spicy). At first the regular spicy curry was not too bad but after a few more bites, you feel the kick. I would really recommend this item - it was super tasty and I think next time, I would even go one spicy level higher.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Naveen Prasad D.,"Food ***** - Service *****- Ambience ****
My wife and I had stumbled upon this place and we absolutely loved it. The wait time was not bad. The food was delicious. I had the spicy chicken on rice and she had a soup. 
This has become our return to place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tom B.,"Great menu with tasty dishes and reasonable prices. The place is just too crowded though. I guess that's the nature of the neighbourhood on a Friday night.  There were people lining up in the cold to get in and the staff were overwhelmed. The decor and atmosphere are chic, but almost bordering on pretentious - perhaps also a reflection of the neighbourhood. 
If you like loud and chaotic and want to feel like you're in a nightclub, you may enjoy this place.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Darren L.,"Very nice place. A little pricy for Thai food but it is really good Thai food so it is worth it. The menu is a little hard to read and the place is very loud, mostly because it is always busy so don't expect to be able to have a quiet conversation. Just bring some spicy friends like like some good spicy food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Caroline C.,"This place is amazing!!!!! The food, the service, the ambiance, everything! It's such a drastic difference from the snooty, overpriced, overly trendy, and passé Khao San Road, where the rude/entitled staff and long wait times don't even come close to compensating for their lacklustre food. The quality of food and service at KSR has drastically diminished since the top talents took their skills to Pai.
At Pai, we had the Grabong to start: buttered squash fritters were mouth wateringly delicious. For mains, we shared a pork belly Gaeng Hunglay, which was my fave dish of the night! Our server said the ox tail version is just as tasty so I'm definitely going back again! Lastly, we had the Pad Gra Prow, famous already in downtown Toronto circles. I made a point to compliment the chef on the rich, bold, and memorable flavours of their dishes; I was that impressed! The wait staff, helpful and friendly, offered a relaxed, professional, and family vibe despite the throng of the Thursday night après work downtown crowd. Kudos to the staff who made my first Pai dining experience completely unforgettable! I will definitely be back for more, and frequently!
I would definitely recommend you try the lychee martini cocktail, I forgot what it was called, but it was soooooooo good!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gabrielle L.,"Everything here was amazingly done. We started with the grabong, fried squash and it was crispy and delicious. Not greasy. 
The Thai tea was perfect, not too sweet and helps with the spice.
I got the Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork. Talk about amazingly flavorful! The pork was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Aromatic for sure. The sauce was tangy. I got it""foreigner spicy"" and I could've gone spicier. If you're someone who really likes heat, I would go all the way to Thai spicy. 
The green curry came in a coconut, and was so unbelievably fresh! The fish was tender.
Everything was plated beautifully. Overall some of the best Thai food I've ever had. If I'm ever in Toronto again, I'll definitely be back.
Also, I found the service to be the perfect amount of friendly without being obnoxious. They checked in, but didn't keep bugging us. They were nice, but sincere.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike B.,"Let's get serious here. The food was good not great and priced appropriately (on the cheap side) given how much rice a typical dish seemed to include. The wine was a skimpy 4 oz glass. 
The fried fish was very, very good and the food came out quickly once we were finally seated. 
But the noise levels were through the roof making any conversation impossible. 
The place was super busy and a wait was inevitable. But they need better communication when the waiting stretches from the promised 30 minutes to close to an hour. 
This all might have been tolerable if we had not been seated next to a very large table of self absorbed, self indulgent 20 something Yuppies. Dancing in the isles to barely audible music when you are seated cheek to jowl in a crowded small space is beyond the pale.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristen C.,"Food: 8/10
Atmosphere: 8/10 
Service: 7.5/10
Overall experience: 7.5/10
My trip to Pai was with a girlfriend for dinner. The place was very busy, which explains some of the slowness of the service. But quite honestly, that's not why I'm giving this place 3/5 stars. 
I ordered the pad thai, and it was good! Thinking back however, I can't differentiate it between the pad thai I've eaten at Nana, or Sukho Thai, or even dare I say...Salad King! While I had been going through a Thai phase at the time, I truly believe that if a Thai place is amazing, it will come through in the pinnacle of Thai cuisines (to us Westerners anyway). So if the pad thai doesn't impress me, I may not be back.
A tip: if you are looking for pad thai that is worth your while, go to Khao San Road. It's the only pad thai that has stood out to me in Toronto. I remember thinking that this would be the kind of thing you would find on the streets of Thailand!
The atmosphere was okay, though other reviewers seem to like. It has a basement-y feel to it - very dim, and very loud with all the people. It is absolutely trendy and all that, but I like to be able to see my menu and my dinner partner.
THE BOTTOM LINE: regular Thai food in a very loud, trendy-basement space.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura B.,"I'm surprised this place has 4 stars, maybe we went on an off night for the chef but honestly I was not impressed by the food. The service was really slow as well, it took a long time for a waitress to take our order, and a while for the food to come.
We got:
Pad Thai with Chicken
Khao Pad Thamada with beef
The pad thai was similar to most take-out Thai places that I've had. It seemed to have a lot of sauce on it though because it felt like it was greasy. Honestly, it didn't taste amazing and was nothing special. The Khao Pad Thamada was not good at all. It reminded me of cheap Chinese-food style fried rice. I actually ended up asking for hot sauce to try and give it some flavor. My boyfriend didn't eat any of it, so there was a lot left over. 
The server DID notice we didn't eat too much of the rice and asked if we liked it. We said we didn't like it too much. She actually let the chef know, so the chef tasted it and also said it wasn't too good.  They took it off our bill! That was really nice and unexpected since we didn't complain about it and had intended on paying for it.
I really feel bad giving only 2 stars because our waitress was so nice about the rice, but honestly the food was not good and I would not return. There are other Thai places downtown that I would rather go back to.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Miyuki K.,Good Thai restaurant in core downtown Toronto - like the street food feel like dining space.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danielle D.,"Honestly I've eaten here many times but each time I go I get great, friendly and fast service which is really impressive because Pai is on of the most consistently delicious Thai places in Toronto. Their Pad Grow is one of my favourite comfort foods, their Chef Nuit Thai is always a winner and their Khao Soo noodles in golden curry literally impresses everyone I know who tries it. It's hard to get seating for more than 2 people sitting peak lunch and dinner times but you can get reservations or order from their marketplace in the back. I go here at least once every two weeks and andissues absolutely recommend giving it a try.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ruiwen A.,"Food is fantastic! OMG, I want to introduce this place to everyone I know. I had Miang Kham here for the first time. I never knew something can be so flavourful. It's such a combination of different flavours and textures in just one single bite. Tom yam soup is one of the best in the city I've ever had. And dishes related to curry are just amazing. No wonder there is always a lineup.
I also love the atmosphere. The decoration just take me right to Bangkok.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivian C.,"Although I've been told the food here isn't that authentic, it's still one of my favorite Thai food restaurant in Toronto. I love the busy environment for dinner with one to two friends. I find if I go with too many people then you can't really hear what everyone's saying because it's loud. I especially love Kaosoi, a curry dish with noodles, for its rich flavor and balance between the texture of the noodles and fried noodles. I think their Thai ice tea and coconut water are good too. I never order the Thai ice tea just for myself since it's quite sweet but coconut water is a must if I'm having something spicy.
It's a good place to go with a close friend or someone who you know well. I find the place loud so if you're really trying to get to know each other you might not be able to hear them well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Monica L.,"My visit was on a Monday night and it was impossible to make reservations as we couldn't get through to the booking line.  My advice? Make reservations way ahead of time, or expect to wait a bit during the peak lunch and dinner hours.  We got the just around 6PM and were lucky to have waited only 10-15 minutes before being seated. The host and servers are all friendly and make you feel welcomed immediately.
The space is pretty large with the main dining room area, waiting area by the bar and a private dining room for groups.  All the furniture creates a rustic & market place feel with wood furniture, school chairs and colourful decor.
Thai Iced Tea - served on a mount of crushed ice, this was delicious.
Pad Thai with Shrimp ($15.00) - Stir fried rice noodle in a homemade tamarind sauce with bean sprouts, tofu, egg & chives. This is the best Pad Thai I've had in Toronto! Highly recommended.
Khao Pad Thamada Beef ($15.00) - stirfried jasmine rice with egg, green onion & oyster sauce.
I've never had this dish before and when it came out, I thought that it looked very plain and simple. The beef was seasoned deliciously and went really well with the egg and jasmine rice. 
Khao Soi ($14.00) - fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions and chicken. This bowl of Khao Soi was very aromatic and had a lot of depth to the curry compared to the Khao Soi at other Thai restaurants. We ordered an extra bowl of rice to literally lick this bowl clean!
My friends and I shared three main entree dishes and left full and extremely satisfied. I really can't pick which dish was my favourite because reliving that night, they were all perfect to their own. Each dish had ingredients that created a harmony amongst their flavours and textures. I'm definitely not waiting to go back to Pai for Thai food! 
PS. Did I mention that they have a quaint patio in the front?",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Oreo C.,"Maybe it was just a bad night but Khao San Road never had a bad night in my experience. Honestly lets just say if I had pai before Khao San Road I wouldn't try anymore thai places like this.
Was in the first batch of dinner customers on Friday night. Ordered the fried squash fritters (Grabong) and they were not crispy at all and tasted a little soggy as if they were pre-made. Khao San Road quality was much better.
Ordered the Ice Thai Tea but the crushed icce didn't work for me. Diluted the drink much faster. Khao San Road had cubed ice and so did the ones in San Diego.
Ordered the Pad thai and the Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork. It was ok but nothiing memorable and nothing I would crave for again unlike at Khao San Road.
The only real advantage I see is less wait and bigger roomier place.
Although they say the chef came from Khao San Road, the quality they put out for me was well below the quality and consistency of Khao San Road.... speaking about it makes me miss Khao San Road.
Not sure if I would go back to Pai but if I do, I hope the quality steps up a bit...",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tina T.,"The food here is very flavourful. I have eaten here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The food has never disappointed.  Their service was excellent, however when I came there for lunch, my order was misplaced and our server took several trips to the kitchen before my dishes were actually brought out. Will definitely be returning.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ethan P.,Some of the best Thai food in the city. Still doesn't compare to real Thai food though.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sugith V.,"Fantastic khao soi, (I usually get chicken or beef) and nua gra (garlic beef).  If you sit by the bar you can make friends with the mixologist who makes excellent cocktails.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carmen L.,"Loved it!!!
AMBIENCE
I really like I was like n Thailand.  The place is underground and it was a cool place.  It had ample seating and a sizeable bar for a nice hangout if you were going for drinks. My guests and I sat at the tall tables, group of six.  There's is cell phone charging station, very safe and useful I left my phone charging over dinner.  A nice place to hangout with friends or a date night.
SERVICE
I like the staff, there was cool and took care of us.  We also had a canteen of water and our food always was served hot and fresh.  It was just the way I like it.
FOOD
So gooood!!!  
Starter - grabong = squash fritters;  paired with a tangy sauce.  Not oily and nice and crispy.
Plah Nua - beef salad.  Roasted rice with some lime sauce.  So good!!!
Som Tom Tad - papaya salad.  Perfect citrus levels.
Entree - gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut.  Green curry was served a coconut, it was so good.  Creamy, savoury and perfect balance.  I ate all of the way down to the coconut meat.  So my favourite.
Dessert - mango sticky rice.  It was good not something that really stuck out.  I don't think I would eat.  Just not my preference.
I am looking forward to returning again, soon!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley S.,"The absolute best Thai in the city. This location is so convenient, quick and meticulous in preparing orders with safety and quality in mind. Thank you, Pai, so happy you're here!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Salina S.,"Good food and ambience, however was freezing sitting close to the door, as every time someone entered the restaurant there was a rush of cold air.
Fried Shrimp appetizer was amazing, and pad Thai was authentic.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bella L.,"I had the ground beef, jasmine rice with an egg on top and cucumbers on the side. Gorgeous food! However the restaurant was playing very loud music and the seats were snug. (Things to consider if you're trying to have a conversation with a friend or a date.) We had a lovely waiter, but one of the waitresses who took our bill by the end of the meal was rude and seemed unimpressed. In conclusion, it was a busy busy busy spot!! But again, food itself was impeccable.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Timmy W.,My wife and I had a layover in Toronto so we decided to hop on the city train and check out the downtown scene. We decided on this Thai restaurant nearby. We had to sit at the bar because all the tables were taken but we loved the experience.  This place is amazing! We had the spring rolls and the chicken wings. I would order them every time without hesitation. You must come to this place if you are in town!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sabyasachi D.,"This is probably the best Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto. I particularly enjoyed the pad Thai. I have been to this restaurant several times and have tried their green curry and some other dishes. This restaurant particularly gets busy during the weekends and  Weekday lunch hours and therefore one must try to come here with enough time on your hands. If you're coming by a car please be prepared to pay skyrocketing prices for parking which means it's better to come here by public transport. While you're waiting for your table feel free to order a drink and hang around by the bar. On certain days, they run a pretty nice offer for drinks so check out before picking a date.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joseph H.,"This place had such great reviews, so at the very least, I expected the food to be enjoyable. Boy i was wrong. The four of us were so excited when we looked at the food and drink menu. Everything looked great! Once we started our meals, we all shared the same disappointed look. A unanimous ehh. None of us finished our food. The icing on the cake though, was that 2 of us actually got sick. I myself, threw up in their bathroom. While my friend did hers back at our hotel. Completely ruined our last night in Toronto. The ONLY reason i did not give this place one star was because my drink before my meal was delicious. I had the tom yum caesar. Spiciest drink i've ever had, hands down. I loved it though. So much flavor and spice. Seems like the drinks are great. So I recommend going their for drinks and appetizers. Stay away from the entrees.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer I.,"So after raving about Pai after my first visit, I was frustrated and disappointed by their lack of customer service. I called 3 times over the course of the past few days in order to make a reservation and never received a call back to confirm or even acknowledge my messages. 
A restaurant as popular as this, which can't even confirm a lunch reservation for 2 definitely loses huge points in my opinion. I'd rather go to Khao San Road.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Darrin C.,"Let me preface this review by saying that I've been a loyal patron of Chef Nuit and Jeff's restaurants for many many years, and that this 3 star rating is probably a one-off that will not deter me from going back and trying Pai again.
Expectations for Chef Nuit and Jeff's restaurants are always high for me ever since my first meal at the original Sukhothai. So when I heard they were opening a new restaurants literally blocks away from where I live, I knew I had to check it out.
When you go to a restaurant within their first few days of opening you have to expect that there will be kinks that need to be worked out as they get into the groove of having a new space, menu, and patronage.
I came in maybe a quarter to closing (10pm), and they were more than happy to accomodate me and my friends for dinner, which wasn't easy to do, since even at closing, the restaurant was packed!
I was looking forward to having a beer, but unfortunately they hadn't been able to obtain their liquor license yet. Which is fine and in no part their fault. I was happy enough to have get the thai ice tea.
For food, we ordered the Tom Yum Soup, Pad Thai, Papaya Salad with salted crab, and Gaeng Hunglay (Pork Belly Curry). For the Gaeng Hunglay, they ran out of the pork belly and had to substitute it with Ox tail, and for the papaya salad, they ran out of the pork rinds that accompany it. Unfortunate again, but it was near the end of service.
The Tom Yum Soup was everything we expected and as good as it always is.
The Pad Thai for me could have used a little more tamirand. I felt sukhothai's pad thai is better, but my friend thought it was every bit as good as sukhothai's so maybe it's just me.
The Gaeng Hunglay with oxtail was tasty, and the oxtail was nice and tender. no complaints there, but I look forward to trying the pork belly next time.
The papaya salad was a bit of a letdown. The salted crabs were a great addition, as it's very reminicent of the street food that you would get in the thailand, vietnam, or laos area. Not something you get very often here in Toronto. I would have liked there to have been more crab to compliment the papaya salad instead of only getting a small taste of it every now and then. The other thing about the papaya salad was the way it was presented. It was kind of deconstructed on a large platter, with the vermicelli noodles on the side which made it a bit disjointed. Take a look at the pictures and maybe it'll make more sense. It seemed like it needed to be mixed, but was it supposed to be mixed on the platter? or our plates? Also because there wasn't any pork rinds they added more vermicelli, which made it a bit off balance as well. Personally, I probably won't be getting this again.
So, all in all, it was alright, but I know it could be (and probably is) better than what I had that one night. Chef Nuit makes some of the best thai food in the city, so I'll be back again, and I'll be sure to update my review and rating when I do",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Reynold P.,"Ever since Pai opened, I've had countless of recommendations to visit immediately. My friends repeatedly gushed over the food, something that was rarely done, especially in front of me as drool literally slipped from mouth to floor.With a salivation level that high, I made it a mission to detour from my prior dinner plans to eat at Pai.
Although being on the waitlist is a given here, the drinking lounge is surprisingly large and arranged just like the dining room- only serving snacks and drinks while you wait. I suggest a reservation, since they take them here at least a day in advance!
The atmosphere is lively, casual, and fun because I get the feeling like I'm inside a hut or house. The place is decked out in wood, brick and unpolished trim. What was most eye-catching was the spinning barrel filled with ice and beer, right when you walk in. Apparently you get something called ""Jelly Beer"" from this, a beer slushie of sorts, from the shaking ice cold water. I ordered a Singha beer to see what this was about, I got a cold beer without the ""jelly."" I guess they didn't think I was ready for this jelly, because baby I probably couldn't handle it
The wait for the food was on the slower side. There were only 2 servers working with a front of the house manager as well. They seemed understaffed but I'm not sure, all I know was that it took a while for the food to arrive despite the kind and helpful waitress.
The menu was two sided, drinks and snacks on one and entrees and salads on the other among other things. I ordered a bunch of dishes:
The most surprisingly great dish of the night was the papaya salad ($14). We ordered it with salted crab instead of the dried shrimp. I was told that the crab was there purely for the flavor, not for eating. The combination of sweet, salty, sour and spicy from the green papaya, chili, tamarind, fish sauce, and lime was on another level.
The Gaeng Hunglay ($15) was a ginger curry that was more stew-ish than anything. The pork belly pieces were incredibly tender, like cut with a spoon tender, while the sauce was a balanced sweet and savory.
The Pad Thai ($14) was really tasty as well. Unlike the fast food versions, this was brown in color and not red. Less sour than you typically expect (which I like) but all the other flavours are there.
The Pad Gra Prow ($15) looks like a simple dish of stir-fry ground beef on rice with an egg, but of course it's not. Deceivingly simple in appearance, the flavours are punched up with basil while the textures add another special dimension you don't expect either.
The Khao Pad Thamada with Chicken ($15) was visually underwhelming, a bit muted with the lack of color. The flavours however, are good but remind me of any fried rice dish out there.
 
Overall, I really enjoyed the food at Pai. Despite the amount of hype and high expectations my friends set it up to be, it certainly, somehow, delivered! The flavours and textures of Thai food are inherently bold and robust. Pai is able to create dishes capturing the true essence of Thai cuisine in their own way at affordable prices and great atmosphere.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fadi A.,Came with a friend from London. We bought the Frits and chicken pad Thai. The pad Thai was simply amazing. Would definitely come back again!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J T.,"Fantastic Thai food and great staff - a winning combination! I had the Gaeng Hunglay - pork belly (also available with ox tail) and a ginger curry rub in a clay pot, served with rice. I've never seen it on a menu before and it was recommended so I had to give it a try. I also ordered the Pad Thai. Too much food for sure, but when I go to a new Thai place, I always want to sample a couple of things. Both were prepared simply and were really exceptional. The menu is a little limited - only about 20 items including starters and mains. This is good I think. It means the things that are on the menu are done very well. It's apparent there is a lot of attention paid to the offerings here. 
Speaking of staff, everyone was really friendly and helpful. I sat at the bar, so I saw more of them than I would have had I been at a table. No fewer than 4 people asked me how I enjoyed my meal. They've only been open about a month so enthusiasm is very high. I get the sense that everyone is fairly dedicated to the chef, the concept and the idea that they are bringing authentic and delicious Thai cuisine.
Pai reminds me a lot of Pok Pok - Andy Ricker's incredible top Thai place in Portland Oregon.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Phoebe L.,"I arrived at around 4:30 to one other table in the restaurant. It was my first time here and we were seated promptly. 
I ordered the green coconut curry and my boyfriend had the pad gra prow. 
We've both been to northern Thailand and I can say that this place lives up to the flavours we had. 
Service was alright. Our server just came by to ask us for drinks then asked if we were ready. Never asked us if we had any questions or anything that could better our experience. 
We will be returning however.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wendy K.,"We ordered two dishes with braised beef, the mamasan curry and khao soi. The beef was extremely tough and neither my husband and I could finish the dishes; the best part were the noodles and rice. The experience was underwhelming and the food was mediocre.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Honestly S L.,Staying downtown and craving some authentic Thai.  This place is Rico.  The very best.  Tough to get in but well worth the wait.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elise T.,"Had the pad Thai with beef, it was good but not the best I have ever had. I really enjoyed the Thai iced tea though",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,AL T.,"Love this place a lot. I been here few time and every time, tried a lot of Thai food that I haven't try before. All my friends love this place now . We will come back",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kat M.,"We first visited Pai when we couldn't get a table at Khao San Road. Now that Khao San Road is closed/moving, Pai is our new financial district go-to for good thai!
What you should eat:
- Get the Pad Gra Prow. Do it, and you will NOT be disappointed. The star of the dish is the meat: highly flavourful, and has a higher kick of spice than other dishes at Pai. If you're a spice amateur do not be brave and get a medium. Stick with mild.
- So happy Grabong was brought in at Pai (was a fave of ours at Khao San). It's a simple fried appetizer and a crowd pleaser.
- Recently Pai also brought in mango with sweet rice and coconut sauce: a classic fave of mine, which is hard to find done well. Pai's version was fresh and tasty.
Be careful:
- Pai fills up really quickly and tends to be busy. Thankfully, they take reservations, but those fill up as well. Book early, or expect a wait in line!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura C T.,"An excellent addition to this saturation of mediocre restaurants close of king street. A perfect pre or post theatre dinner or drinks. 
Love how it feels like I've walked into a tropical island and left the city. 
Right now their menu still seems to  be finalized. There were items that weren't on the menu like the ox tail curry and pork belly everything.  I found the portions small at first but it was a good size in the end for two people. 
We had the ox tail curry which was excellent and the fried fish with tamarind sauce. It was delicately fried and not greasy. 
For dessert the mango sticky rice was really good and recommended. 
They have a nice mat kneeling area good for     
A good size group. Also a small nook to the left and a private party room begin the bar ? 
Lots of options for drinks and fun. No liquor license yet!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John C.,"This place is like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles lair.  The first time I went I didn't realize the place was more than a tight dive bar, but the place has layers. Great energy and service, the staff are super nice.  Smaller menu, but each dish looks really good in its on way, so it's hard to choose.  Will be back next time I'm in Toronto!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sabrina R.,"Favourite cheap food in Toronto!!! Authentic Thai food, good for portions and incredible price. Is there anything else I can say?",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela J.,"some people are dreaming of a white christmas, i'm gonna be dreaming of the chicken fried rice and green curry. the green curry was well balanced and very flavorful, and the concept of serving it in a coconut was very delicious in practice. the chicken fried rice was not greasy, and i could've eaten this all day long. the thai tea was creamy and the perfect amount of sweet.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sonam R.,"I'll keep this review real simple, think Khao San Road, but better! They take resos. The music is popping and it's huge. Queues were long on the Friday night I went, but since they take reservations I just watched  the masses line up.
Awesome appetizer menu, go for Grabong - squash fritters. Cucumber Collins with Hendricks, cucumber, lime juice, and soda is refreshing and pairs well with spicy dishes. 
Eat here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Albert O.,"Delicious! 
The restaurant was packed, and there was an hour wait. 
I was initially put off by Pai's unwillingness to alter their menu items. However, when the food came, it was delicious, spicy, and perfect.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivian L.,"The taste is good.  The portion is ok.  Nothing fancy, ordinary Thai food like rice and noodles.  Not traditional Thai food, more like a Thai fast food with Bar service.  Located in a basement.  It's good because it's in Toronto downtown.  If you have been to Thailand.  it's not authentic Thai food.  No lemon fish, no shrimp cake, no stir fry vege with shrimp sauce, etc.  Overpriced.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carm H.,"Being on the list of the many websites of must-tries for Toronto, I was excited for to try it out as it would also be my first time trying Thai food. The menu is condensed into dishes that offers a variety of tastes for individuals and they also have a list of cocktails that are Thai inspired. For myself, I had ordered the Khao Soi - egg noodles in coconut milk with a curry soup base served with chicken breast. It was quite delicious with the spice from the curry, giving it a kick. The chicken breast was a little too dry for my taste. Overall, it was a decent experience. The service was efficient, friendly and the food was delivered in a timely manner. Side note: be wary of the long line ups you may encounter as this place is quite popular.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diana D.,"I attended a Zomato Meetup where I caught up with fellow food bloggers and ate delicious Northern Thai cuisine! Pai is one of the many Thai restaurants owned by Chef Nuit and her husband, Jeff. You might not know them, but you probably know their most popular restaurant, Khao San Road!
I had the pleasure of trying a variety of dishes during this event that are also on the regular menu. The Som Tum Tad (Papaya Salad) was the starting appetizer. I was confused by the set up of the dish, because it looked like it was a one person portion. Regardless, everyone tried to take equally small portions for themselves. It was my least favourite dish out of everything we've tried.
The first main dish was the Gaeng Kiaw Wan (Green Curry) served with rice. I enjoyed this curry quite a bit. To make it more fun, it was served in a coconut! Shortly thereafter, our second main dish was Chef Nuit Chicken Pad Thai Platter. The pad thai was quite delicious too. The third dish was a surprise dish. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a hold of the plate's name. Judging by the ingredients from their online menu, I guessed it was the Plah Nua (Beef Salad). For this dish, you have sticky rice and cooked beef. You take the rice and scrunch it up into a ball with your hand. Then, you stick the beef onto the rice and eat it together using your hands. It was a new experience for me. I wasn't crazy about this plate compared to the pad thai and curry. It was cool to try regardless.
Lastly, we had dessert. It was mango sticky rice and I enjoyed it more than I expected! The sweetness of the mango along with the sticky rice made a great combo. Despite having a couple of my own drinks, I got to sample a fellow foodie's cocktail. I HIGHLY recommend you order the Tea Ross. It's a delicious spiked Thai iced tea. I would go back to Pai for this drink and I never order cocktails or alcohol at a restaurant (only at pubs).
Overall, I loved my experience at Pai. I would definitely recommend it if you have tried Khao San Road or want to eat some Thai food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jonas B.,"I have some good news for those eagerly awaiting Jeff & Chef Nuit's latest Thai restaurant, Pai is open! 
The menu is currently abbreviated (during the soft opening stage) with a selection of her most popular dishes, but will be expanding to a full menu (and will have a liquor license) soon. 
Quality is excellent (as you'd expect if you've been to Sukho Thai, Khao San Road, or Sabai Sabai) and the flavors are authentic thai. I ordered the fried basa which now comes with a green curry sauce (which is even tastier than the tamarind sauce at Sabai). 
Excited to see the full menu get rolled out at Pai, we'll be back soon!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jem 1.,Love the food here! The pad thai and the pad gra pow are our favourite! Also love the Thai iced tea,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley O.,I really liked the freshness of the food here. While reservations are highly recommended because the place was packed even with reservations the food is definitely worth it. I became huge Thai food fan after going here for friends birthday,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Selvynna T.,Food is excellent. One of the best Thai places in Toronto. The wait is quite long but if you arrive after 9 on a weekday there should be no wait.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brandon M.,"I was perhaps a bit overzealous at first. I ate at Pai within a couple weeks of it opening  and was maybe factoring in some expected improvement and menu expansion/diversification. 
Neither has materialized and I think things have largely gone downhill. The papaya salad I ordered the first time I ate at Pai was loaded with little salted crabs; the last time I ate there (five days ago), there was one-half of a measly little salted crab in it. Ditto with the pad thai -- I had one a month or two ago with only three shrimp in it.
Aside from the addition of northern thai sausages and a couple rice dishes, the menu hasn't really changed here despite what Chef Nuit initially promised -- no new curries or stir-fried dishes.
Finally, the food isn't nearly spicy enough here, even at the highest spice level.
So I take back everything I said. The food here is still excellent relative to most Thai options in the city, but I remain partial to Khao San Road, which has a wider menu (without hurting quality), higher spice levels and more quality control consistency overall.
Points for actually taking reservations and offering delivery, although the latter is unpredictable -- could be 30 minutes or an hour and a half.
Finally, a plea: Can someone open an Isan Thai place downtown?",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joachim M.,"Good service, authentic food and awesome vibe! 
It's a pretty funky place. Highly recommended if you want to impress anyone in a casual and fun setting.  I'm not an expert in Thai food, but I think they have a few unique items on the menu which I enjoyed tasting. The Pad Thai is also very good, if you want to stick with something you know. I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alisha K.,"Booked reservations in April for dinner in May - a huge testament to how busy they are. From the moment we came in, the environment was great and the decor was very different. We got right into it and ordered an appetizer while I ordered a bed of rice with prawns and a fried egg and my friend ordered green curry with rice. I also asked for my dish to have the absolute spiciest flavouring they offered. My mistake as I was extremely overconfident with my ability to handle spice, and thought I'd be fine. They did ask me if I could handle spice and MAN did they deliver! I was sweating bullets and my tongue definitely lost some taste buds but it was amazing and they definitely came through as promised. We also got the Thai iced coffee which was amazing - definitely try that if you need to get a drink that'll cool down your senses. Will 100% go again and recommend it to anyone to try even once!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patricia T.,"Save the money and time you would've spent here and take yourself down the block to Khao San Road. I had ordered the Pad Thai to go because a 45 minute wait seemed high unappealing. I started to eat it within of 5 minutes of receiving it and I was shocked. The taste was EXTREMELY weak and unflavoured. The flavour that was there, was good and had and the ""spicy"" level was okay. Overall, I wasn't as pissed just because I didn't have to suffer through the extreme pain of waiting in their line. Cannot justify the $18 I spent here.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Huma M.,First time in Toronto and stumbled upon this place through yelp! The food was AMAZING. The drinks were delicious and everyone was so kind and welcoming. The service was the icing on the cake to an amazing experience. I tried the starter Tom yum soup and it was the best I've ever had!! My only regret was not having enough room for the mango sticky rice because it looked SO good. Definitely recommend on a nice chilly day for some amazing comforting Thai food.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Halina T.,"To sum it up...
Try to book a reservation, because this place is JAMMED PACKED! And you must try the thai iced tea. It was amazing!
The pad thai was very good but it tasted like any other. The curry was good, it was very rich and creamy. 
The atmosphere is absolutely great here and the server we had was amazing.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hazel T.,"Clearly mine and Hubby's favourite Thai place right now. I come in quite often for take out. Please try the Pad Grow Prow with crispy pork. It is the best dish, can't  describe how good it is but trust me. And if you like spicy, Thai spicy is the way to go! The Khao Soi with braised beef was also delicious and broth not too heavy. Don't leave without having the sticky rice mango for dessert. It is delicious! Would absolutely recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea C.,One of my go to places when craving Thai food. One of my favorites is the chiang Mai beef noodle - the broth is difficult to describe with a sour taste similar to Tom yum and had generous portions of beef. Their pa gra prow is very flavourful and the egg is . Would recommend everything on the menu!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shannon N.,"This is the best thai food in toronto, hands down. If ever I  have someone visiting toronto, I take them to this spot. The pad thai is delicious and they don't  skimp on the tamarind. I've been to Thailand and so far, no other toronto spot comes close to Pai for authentic Thai food. Their curry is also really good but I definitely come back for the pad thai",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bella D.,"Love this place, amazing food, great atmosphere, friendly and efficient staff. Really like it.
The only thing that made me knock down one star is that sometimes they're a victim of their own success and it can be a little bit disorganized in terms of getting the tables cleaned up and turned around, which means sometimes you'll have to wait a bit for a table that is actually already free but just wasn't set up yet. But hey, once you get the table, you're in for amazing food, and it will arrive quickly and it will amaze you, so it's totally worth the wait.
Try the massaman beef, it's outstanding.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steph O.,"So touristy (kitschy) but amazing! Yes, you'll likely have to wait in a long line to get a seat but the food is great and so is the service. I highly recommend the Thai iced tea and pad thai. I've been to Thailand twice and this might be my favourite Thai place in Toronto.
Enjoy!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lora D.,Had the spring roll and pad Thai. A little pricey but delicious. The restaurant is bigger than expected. Have a fun looking drink menu. My only complaint is some genius brought a screaming baby which slightly dampened my dining experience.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andy O.,They have a fantastic menu and it's fairly priced not to mention it is one of the best Thai places in the city. The only suggestion I have is to improve reso portal on the site. Overall it's fantastic.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jose R.,"Food: if you have ever been to Northern Thailand and you miss their food, you should come here. It is the real deal. This is why I gave them 4 stars. Just don't expect to pay the same you would in Thailand...
Service: not as good as their food. Don't come here if you are in a hurry. It took them 20 minutes to bring the check.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arceu A.,"I frequent this place a lot. If you are coming for dinner make sure you get a reservation. there always a wait for this place. I usually come alone sit at the bar. And my favourite dish is Pad Gra Prow with Crispy Pork at Medium Spice. It satisfies the fill and not to much. 
 The atmosphere of the place is as well just amazing, music and setting. One thing I would like for them is to put hooks by the wall or something for coats for people sitting on the high chairs. or some kind of coat check. 
 But the staff is friendly and patient and well informed.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Annanth A.,"Went to Khao San Road as a group of 6 only to find out it was closed for the long weekend. We instead went to Pai North and got seats on the patio. Just after we ordered food a storm blew through, but the waitress was kind enough to get us seats at another table indoors. 
The interior is roomy with island themed decor mixed in with random antiques.
Our food came out fairly quickly, even though the place was packed. I ordered the Pad Thai with Beef, with extra peanut sauce on the side. It was more curried than a normal Pad Thai and was fairly spicy for medium. Overall probably the best Pad Thai I have had in the city. 
Great value overall - will definitely be back to check out the other dishes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Francis G.,So glad i took a chance this time without réservation lunch time saturday . Everytime i try making dinner reservation when visiting Toronto they're booked up and suggest three weeks later. Think not northern thai cuisine is so good when well executed the freshness of the prawns green papaya salad. Pad thai ; red curry . Must try that place when in TO.wish it was here in Mtl. We are lacking good thai rest.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Olivia P.,Best Thai food I've had in so long! The Tom yum soup was to die for. We ordered from DoorDash for pickup and they accidentally gave our order to another person with the same name but they gave us free Thai iced teas  while we waited. Would love to go again.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sen S.,"It is one of the best authentic Thai food places to check out for sure!  I tried out their Pad Gra Prow and the spice level was just perfect for me (tried the Farang Spicy or Foriegner spicy).   I liked the atmosphere there.  Just a heads up even with the reservations we had to wait good 20-30 minutes.  But it was worth the wait.  Only issue we had with our experience there was the staff member who waited us, she was not so customer friendly person and should be taught how to deal with customers! Despite that negative experience, overall great food!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thomas N.,Amazingly authentic Thai food.  The staff was courteous.  Only 10 minute wait as tables turn over quickly.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kyle M.,"Chicken Pad Thai is heavy on oil, light on flavour and way too sweet. I had to add vinegar to counter the sweetness and cut the oil.  Good portion size and amount of chicken though.  Too expensive for what it is, there are better Thai places in the city.
Final verdict: Over-hyped and over-priced.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jun Y.,"The food was good but didn't get the point why there's such a long line up. And we waited soooo long for the food. I feel the waiting kind of offset the good taste of the food. It's worth of going if there's no huge line up and no ""years of waiting"" at the table!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Al A.,"This is a place I keep going back to.  The food is excellent. This is not your typical Thai place.  The food is out of this world. Every time I come in, I choose something different. And I'm always pleasantly surprised at the flavor.  You have to make a reservation as this place is very popular.  Well worth the effort.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ray M.,"I love this place because of the food, the service and how it was designed to look like street side restaurants around Asian countries. I don't like the long wait times... but that is because people know its good and everyones waiting for their turn to dine.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna R.,Wonderful restaurant! Make sure to get your reservation ahead of time -- or do what we do: Come during the off hours. Took a cousin who is vegan -- and absolutely loved being able to order freely. Fun vibe and great date spot (even if it can get a little loud...),5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sepideh S.,My all time fav Thai food...my fav is turnip fries & their green coconut curry with braised beef. The layout is great & entertaining as well.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nadia Y.,"Another trendy Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto.
I came here for my friend's birthday dinner because I had heard that this place takes reservations and that the food was very similar to Khao San Road. The squash fritters were crispy, portions were good, and it tasted fresh. I ordered the Khao Soi and my friends ordered the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup. My order was great, but of course, like most Khao Soi's, it was very rich and creamy. Definitely too much for one person to eat in one sitting. I can normally eat quite a bit, but I still had to take half of it home with me.
The prices were reasonable, again, similar to Khao San Road. The atmosphere was casual and very loud. The service was good, but I noticed that it was quite slow.
This place gets very busy in the evening, and we came on a Saturday night at 6pm. The lineup was quite long by the time we left. Make sure you make reservations at least a few days in advance!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ula Z.,"We tried the basil fried rice, and it's absolutely a hit! Such a unique flavour. I would definitely come back for this place. The only downside would be the long wait, but they have a nice waiting area.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jordy G.,"First Sukho Thai spawned Koh San Road and now Chef Nuit left Koh San Road to open Pai, Toronto's latest delicious Thai restaurant. 
Having had a blast in the small town of Pai when I lived in Thailand I had great memories come back as we headed down to check out this new restaurant. 
It was a good thing we made a reservation, something that I don't think you can do at Sukho Thai or Koh San Road, as Pai was packed with a 90 minute wait at the door. 
Of the three restaurants listed above Pai has the nicest decor and the seating is more spaced out which is a nice change. 
The food, as advertised was delicious. I feel like Pai's prices are the same or a little more than at Koh San Road and definitely more than at Sukho Thai. The one difference is that you probably get more food at the other locations.
The squash fritters were delicious and similar to what you get at Koh San Road. The difference was that they were served with an especially amazing sauce at Pai. 
The Northern Thai sweet grilled pork on a skewer was also tasty.
The Pad Thai had a nice tang to it. 
The Massaman Braised Beef had a lovely flavour and the meat flaked apart easily. 
We ordered the Khao Pad Saparot with chicken which came served in half a pineapple which was a nice touch. 
We finished up with the one item on the dessert menu - mango sticky rice. This is an absolute staple in Thailand and I don't believe I have seen it on a menu in Toronto before. Other than that fresh mangoes come right off the tree in Thailand with a special flavour, this dish was very close to what you get in Thailand. I had not tasted this combination of flavours in years. 
We struck out and ordered mostly new dishes I had not tried before. Pai has many of my favourites, like green curry and Khao Soi, but I have yet to try them at their establishment. 
One of the staff told us how sorry they were that they got behind in the kitchen and took 45 minutes to serve our food. I am glad that they are so busy and appreciated the apology, but they probably should have thrown in something like dessert for free after making us wait such a long time. 
If you go to Pai you will not be disappointed and I do need to go back and try their versions of some of my favourites.
At this point I still might be partial to Sukho Thai which provides more value or Koh San Road, where I was introduced to some of my favourites in the first place. I will update this post the next time I go back to Pai.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ian S.,"I went to Pai last week and was quite impressed with the quality the meals.  I've been to Thailand a number of times, and Pai's is definitely authentic.  Making it even better, the prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are large, which explains why it was packed on a Tuesday night at 8:30p  I had the Gaeng Hunglay with ox tail, which was perfectly braised in a tasty curry sauce. As for the ambiance, it is casual although there is an eclectic mix of hipsters and suits.  
If I had to ding them a point - and this may be petty - it would be on the variety of the mains and the lack of off-menu specials.  Otherwise, I definitely recommend Pai - I'll be going back there again.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ed S.,"I don't get the raves. It's like people have never had good Thai before so the best of a mediocre bunch gets elevated to cult status. The space is fun, the food is good and well executed, but it's not mind blowing or amazing. It's good, not great. Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff, but my first choice (Gaeng Hunglay) wasn't available and I couldn't find anything that different from regular Thai food. In fact, despite being northern Thai, there was no larb or gai yang or pla som. I've been to Nuit's KSR and Sabai Sabai and enjoyed KSR's curries, but I wanted to avoid curries since this is northern Thai.
We had Pad Gra Prow and Khao Pla Tawt. The Pad Gra Prow was tasty and flavorful, w/ nice textural contrasts, but the flavor wasn't all that complex or deep. 
The Khao Pla Tawt was four pieces of well made, crispy basa. Basa's pretty flavorless so one sweetish and one spicy sauce are included. Mix the two together and there's where the flavor comes from. To mix things up, you can choose to use one sauce or the other or mix them up in varying amounts. That's where all the flavor variety comes from. 
This is a good place w/ a fun, communal atmosphere that would be great w/ a group of friends ordering different things and sharing. It gets crowded so make a reservation if you don't want to wait at the height of the dinner rush.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shawna S.,"This place is a treat! I've tried sabai sabai and khao San road, both are good but nothing wow me like this place does. Pad Thai was a bit salty but authentic. Unlike other Thai restaurants, they use the real deal "" Tamarind sauce"" and not Ketchup.
 The most enjoyable dish was the pork belly. You can easily devour 2 bowls of rice with the pork belly- thumbs up!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah S.,"Pai definitely lives up to their hype - they are hands down, one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto. The khao soi chicken that I ordered was rich, filling and oh-so delicious! I loved the energy at Pai as well - perfect for large parties or dates! There is also a section in the restaurant where you can have a more authentic Thai experience where you sit down on mats and enjoy the delicious food that they serve. We got to the restaurant on a Saturday at around 3 pm - we only waiters for 5 minutes before sitting down. So...if you ever want to come visit Pai but do not want to wait to be seated and you haven't booked reservations, coming in during the late afternoon would be your best option. I am most definitely down for coming back to  Pai again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Catherine M.,"Food is fantastic -  very authentic Thai food having been to Bangkok a few times and eating the local culinary delights there (Pai flavours on their various dishes are spot on).  This place is quite large and gets packed at nights (esp. Friday and Sat).  Great customer service and wonderful food, keep up the good work!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jill M.,The food was absolutely DELICIOUS. The wait was ridiculous but the meal at the end was totally worth it. Get there early and wait it out. You won't be sorry.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura Z.,"Honestly THE most outstanding Thai food I have ever had in my entire life. I ordered my staple white girl Chicken Pad Thai. Every single bite was immensely filled with flavour. The spicy level was light for ""medium"" but it was so delicately done that you could still savour the taste of the noodles. Unreal food. 
The service was quick and forthright. Everything was prompt and they kept the tables nice and clean as you ate picking up chop stick wrappers as they walked by with lightening speed. Just the right amount of checking in with you periodically so as to not disturb or be an annoyance. 
The ambiance was awesome. They played reggae and dancehall music which shot me straight back to bar hopping and high school dances. It forced my girlfriend and I smile and seat dance a little bit! They had simple table decor with just one lit candle. It was a bit loud but I was totally into it!! It's definitely my new fav for Thai food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa E.,"So I visited Pai on Friday on the recommendation of a few coworkers. Verdict: Glad I came.
Had to have lunch at 2:00 pm as it was so hard to get an earlier reservation.  I definitely advise you reserve rather than show up here as it's busy always.
So for starters, we ordered the spring rolls and kung tawt shrimp. Both were very tasty, but slightly over fried. We had wanted to order the chicken wings but couldn't justify paying $5.00 for only 3 wings. A little much.
For drinks, we had water and spicy ginger beer(bottled).  $4.00 was a too much for the small sized bottle I received.
For our main dishes: I had the Khao Soi with chicken (2 drumsticks) and my guest had the good old staple of Pad Thai with chicken.
My meal was amazing, but not as spicy as I would have preferred although I did request additional chilis be used. Fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions and your choice of Braised Beef, Chicken Breast or Chicken Drumsticks (contains shrimp paste)---menu description
The flavour was indescribable. My only concern was the mess factor. I wasn't expecting the amount of broth it came with and ended up wearing some home as it was splashing everywhere.
My guest, she thoroughly enjoyed her pad thia..one of the best she has tasted, in her words.
Overall, really enjoyed this place. I wished there were more options on the menu. I would have loved a mango salad but they only offered papaya.
The atmosphere was nice...kinda urban hipster. The music was awesome. I dined while jamming out to some old school hip-hop vibes.  Would definitely return.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jack W.,One of the best pad Thai places in the entertainment district.  I had the Pad Thai here and it tasted extremely fresh and delicious. It's not made from the usual sweet and sour looking red sauce at the Chinese run restaurants. You can really tell they use good ingredients here. Would definitely recommend.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael S.,Excellent food with lots a of choice capable of filling anyone's tastes. Do be warned you need to book a reservation as this spot gets very busy and waiting in line for a table to open will take a while. The decor inside the restaurant is also really cool and makes the place feel unique.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karen V.,I always get the papaya salad and the chickens growers and that's plenty full. when coming here like to go with friends that way I can order a bunch of stuff and we can share it because there's just so many delicious dishes there,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Monica X.,"Good service + excellent Thai food + comfortable portions + relaxing ambience = happy diner
5/5 would come back again!
Had the basil chicken on jasmine rice... Super authentic and flavourful. Food came relatively quickly too, which made the entire dining experience very enjoyable. 
I'm a definite pai fan!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anchal K.,"Well worth the wait for a Thai restaurant,overall delicious main dishes and various pairings/ flavors of cocktails & drinks.  My friend wasn't satisfied with one of the cocktails she ordered and the staff were very friendly and accommodated to us right away. Recommend both the Green Curry &Khao Soi. Would come here again.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tomaso D.,"A fantastic Papaya Salad
A quick service
A nice decor
Fun fact: I always say a highway sign outside the restaurant, not sure if it was a garage sale warehouse or a hipster cafe.
Sad fact: Winter takes away the patio charm and the summer beverages
Win fact: Papaya Salad is a winner",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alana E.,Best Thai food I have ever had. Both the green curry and golden (yellow) was rich and not over whelming. The atmosphere was equally as interesting. We were never let down here.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amber L.,Great thai place in Toronto.  We started With Tom yum soup which was flavorful and nice.  Went to the coconut curry and shrimp pad thai. Both were very nice.  The downside is how hard it is to get into this place.  We waited 45 min on a Saturday night at 9pm. Was good though or we were starved.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daphne W.,"My friends and I decided to try Pai as it was on my list of food places to go to. It was a Sunday night and we decided to try our luck and walk in, they told us they we could put our name down and come back around 6:30 since we also thought it was too early for dinner. 
Soon enough we came back, we waited for maybe 10 mins and sat down at our table. This place is busy and I loved the fun and casual vibe! I loved the decor and atmosphere, as I also noticed spider man- literally a figurine- hanging above us lol!
We were quickly served our water and the server promptly asked for our drink orders. No doubt about it, you got to try the Thai ice tea- it is definitely spot on!  
For the entree, I didn't know what to order but I was eye'ing the 2 dishes with egg in them. After asking our knowledgeable server, I got the pad kra prow moo krob- minced meat, crispy pork and egg with rice. I didn't know what to expect since I usually get pad Thai or curry at Thai places and I wanted to be adventurous this time. Omgee..this dish is bomb! It's fatty but they cooked the crispy pork so well that it just melts in your mouth- I am so glad I took the server's recommendation! The dish is very yummy and the portion is very generous. 
My friends ordered pad Thai and the curry. They all enjoyed it. We also shared  the sai ua platter which is northern Thai sausages served with sticky rice and this spicy sauce which makes it super tasty.
We were so full that we didn't try the mango sticky rice- next time for sure!
Oh...and also the squash fritters next time...",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marra S.,"Amazing food, great atmosphere. I had the pad thai and it tasted so much fresher than any other pad thai I have had. Service is quick and friendly, and also their coconut sorbet was delicious! Atmosphere has a homey vibe, well priced as well :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ro M.,"Really really good Thai food with a lot of vegan options. I got the vegan pad Thai and spring rolls. They were both really delicious. Their service was good and their patio is fairly nice. Their prices are a bit high tbh. We had two entrees, spring rolls, and sangria ended up being $70+",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tiff L.,"I'll start by saying yes I would go back. However, there were some flaws + by no means is this The Best Thai Restaurant in North America. I'm going to keep it real with y'all because I'm not a sheep + I don't buy into hype/follow the crowd. You want the real deal? Then listen up cuz I'll give it to you straight, no chaser. 
Let me break it down.....
Ambiance/Atmosphere:
Rustic and warehouse type of feel but with a slight touch of Thailand. The aesthetic of this restaurant is very nice, lots of wood, weird vintage embellishments and interesting mix of music. The restaurant itself is huge (there's multiple bars and seating areas). Our spot was at back end of the restaurant. I was surprised at how far back the restaurant went. Lots of nice nooks and crannies to take cool photos for your social media accounts ;) the lighting is very dim though so the shots may not turn out as high quality with your phone. Bring your DSLR booboo. Don't worry about dressing up too much as it's a casual place.
Food/Drinks:
- It is pretty authentic, however, our food took around 45 minutes to come
- So have you ever had lukewarm food?? Never in my life have I experienced Thai or Vietnamese food that was ""lukewarm."" What a horrible surprise! I thought it was just me but my friends that ordered the green curry were like nope mine's kinda cold too. 
- Now let's get to everyone's favourite, the drinks. They were very watered down IMO and the bartenders were STINGY with it. I hate stingy drinks, freaking despise it. It's just like ordering drinks at a club instead of pregaming at a proper bar or going to your local mixologist connoisseur friend Bob, who has a massive stash at his place and lives to entertain + make you a drink like no other. My friend and I ordered a Sake bombs. The waitress said it was 3 shots in one but tbh it looked like 2 and a half shots, not 3. Yeeeaaaahhhh they're stingy af with their booze #notcute. The place has to make money, I understand that. However, if I'm seeing all these stellar reviews making this place out be god's gift to the earth then I'm obviously not gonna sit back and act like everything is all hunky dory with a big ass smile on my face. 
- Not as vegan friendly/dairy-free as one would think. The menu online doesn't really mention anything about dairy but the menu at the restaurant kept on listing (contains dairy) so much that I was like, you know let me just stick with the Pad Cha Hett (vegan option) before I screw myself over. I'm more of a pescetarian because I eat seafood so I would have ordered the seafood dishes but I'm just not a fan of dairy or hen's period so yeah. I have to go back and do some more investigating on that front. Their veggie spring rolls and other stuff could probably provide more variety for someone that is vegan/vegetarian etc. BTW ONE vegan option on your menu does not mean your restaurant is vegan friendly. I guess you can order sides and appetizers that are vegan/dairy-free but that would just add up and make everything more expensive and I don't believe that anyone should have to drop $50 to have a good/decent meal in they city. It's not worth it.
- Granted all that has been said, the portion sizes of the dishes are very good. My friends and I received decent portions for our main course orders. We were all full and despite the food being lukewarm, the spices and flavour were on point. 
Service: 
Service was very fast and efficient. It was very busy the night we went (Sunday). There were multiple waitors/waitresses attending to us. They kept on asking if my group was ready to order and kind of pressured/rushed us to order but yeah we weren't fazed. The bad thing we encountered was how a particular loud-mouthed waitress handled our bill situation in the end. We all asked for separate bills. She comes throws down the bills and quickly and says ""I just split the spring rolls between everyone."" Ok so only one of my friends ordered that appetizer and ate it by herself, we did not share that dish. We nearly were going to pay and work out the difference which a customer should not have to do. The waitress was definitely at fault here and did us a shady move. The second time round was not better as our bills were still mixed up so we told her exactly what we ordered and finally got an accurate bill (3rd attempt).
Crowd/Scene: 
This place is honestly just a student dive lol. I didn't see anyone over 40 except for one lady. She looked cool. I wanted to chit chat with her. Very LIVELY and LOUD. Good for double dates not 1 on 1 dates. Could be good for pregaming. I guess the more alcohol you order, the more the bartender will notice and give you a good round. If you're mainly going for drinks then stick with drinks and a few appetizers. If you're going for food then don't expect the drinks to be strong. If you're introverted and aren't really outgoing then this envi. may not be your favourite lol. Not good for overly large groups. Keep your group sizes smallish ;)",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Catherine W.,"I've never been to Thailand but I imagine that the food you would get there tastes pretty close to the food they serve at PAI. Absolutely superb food. The restaurant was extremely busy, but we were seated within 15 minutes. Quick service, from friendly and knowledgeable servers who were more than willing to offer recommendations. Very cool decor-there was something fun to look at on every wall and in every corner.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex K.,"My fiancee and I came here for a late dinner after the Jays/Red Sox game.  We walked in around 9:30 p.m and had to wait about five minutes for a table to be cleaned off for us. The restaurant really has a warm and cozy atmosphere but it is pretty small and you are sitting about a foot and a half away from the people at the next table so it gets loud. You may as well be sitting at the same table. When we went, it was pretty full. Not crowded, but I think there were only one or two empty tables in there. We found ourselves almost yelling when we were trying to talk because it does get pretty loud inside and you have to compete with other people yelling and talking really loudly. This is no fault of the restaurant and it's one of those things that you just have to deal with when you go to a popular restaurant so we were fine with it.
As far as the food goes, my fiancee's pad thai was very very good. It has a unique flavoring to it while still maintaining the traditional pad thai taste that we all know so well.  I had the chiang mai beef noodle soup w/ peanuts and it was delicious. I highly recommend both dishes.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael W.,"Authentic, great service, owner chef, amazing tastes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Timmy L.,"A wonderful place. The pricing is not the cheapest, but once in a while I'd treat myself by going here since it is so yummy. Great service, and the food tastes amazing! Very friendly to multiple dietary restrictions. Im a vegan and their vegan tofu pad thai is amazing.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Muneeb A.,This place is always super packed. Be prepared to wait before you get a table. Went in a few times because of the hype but it failed  to impress. Pretty average food for me but the wife seems to love it,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marina T.,"We only had one day in Toronto - SO happy we chose to stop here for a late lunch. Fun atmosphere, super friendly servers and bartenders and amazing food!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sergio J.,"Amazing food, great service, and very reasonable prices. I couldn't ask for more from a restaurant. The place is decorated in a pretty cool way and the washrooms have thai language lessons looping on which is lots of fun. 
Its also a great location cause you can go there before enjoying a show or going to a pub. 
Honestly I can't think of another thai restaurant in the city that meets every aspect of a perfect score like this one.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rebecca Z.,"We made a reservation for 730pm on a Tuesday which was great as there were a lot of people waiting when we got there. It took a while for the waiters to come around to take our orders and took another while for our food to come out. We ordered the green curry and pad gra. BE WARNED, the portions are very small. So if you have a big appetite, one dish per person may not be enough. Overall I think I still prefer other Thai places around town, like Thai basil as it is more authentic and portions are much bigger. I would return again if I'm not feeling very hungry.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emory L.,"Had the Pad Thai, very good flavours. Fresh taste from all the ingredients, especially the chives. The Pad Thai is spicier than what the scale suggests, order anything above medium with caution. Overall very good food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sally O.,"Came here today for dinner. We were in the area and decided to try Pai out after reading so many good things about it. We ordered the Chef nuir pad thai, khao soi with beef brisket, pad gra prow and sai ua platter. Everything was amazing. My friends, who do not regularly eat thai food, fell in love with this restaurant as well. The only bad thing about this place is that they are extremely busy! The wait for us to get a seat was around half an hour, and took the food another half an hour to get to our table. But it was worth the wait. I will be back!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,ralph q.,"My current favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto. It is always jammed and can be a little noisy but the taste of the food is amazing!  There is usually a lineup but they are super good at getting everyone seated asap. 
They also make an incredible Old Fashion.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,O S.,"My only complaint is that it's always busy there and hard to get a table. Not surprising given how good the food is.
Get the fresh coconut water if you're eating something spicy. Get the Laab or the squash fritters as an appetizer. Every main dish I've tried was fantastic. You can't go wrong with Pai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin T.,"This remains our top thai restaurant in Toronto for the Pad Thai and for the Pad Gra Prao. Just got back from Thailand and I would say the Pad Gra Prao is authentic and comparable to what you would find there. 
It's great that they expanded the location which has reduced the wait time a bit but do expect to still have to line up for a table. 
Would easily have given this place 5 stars only I've found (might just be me) that the portions have gotten a bit smaller during lunch - relative to previous times I've been there for lunch. 
Overall, highly recommend. Great lively atmosphere and awesome food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andy L.,"The sangria pitcher had too much ice in it, which potentially diluted the taste of the sangria as well.  Other than that, I think that this restaurant is deserving of five stars.  The food was very tasteful, especially the fillet (on the menu it is called khao pla tawt).  We also got the egg noodles (khao soi).  Once we began to take bites, it was instantly food heaven.  If it was all-you-can-eat, I would stay there for years without leaving and eat that great fillet.  The waitress was friendly and the wait time was nice and short, but probably because we went a bit earlier than most people go.  We went around 18:00, but even then, it was mostly filled.  The space was very spacious.  Overall, I would definitely come again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Blair M.,"From the moment I walked in, I knew this was going to be an authentic Thai experiencing. It's been nearly impossible to find Chang beer the way I remembered it in Thailand but this was as close as it gets. 
They had tones of options for different dietary restrictions, and all tasted delicious. Very happy all around. One critique is that the restaurant is clearly designed for larger groups of 4 or more. It would be nice if there were spots besides the small bar area for solo diners.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Richard K.,"We had a really great meal at this downtown Toronto restaurant.  Atmosphere is casual and fun.  The staff was extremely nice and helped us to get in and out of there to make our TIFF.  We had the Khao Soi, a delicious curry noodle dish with a tender brisket.  The sauce was rich and juice.  Also, we had Pad Gra Prow with chicken with an egg on top (definitely compliment the other dish).  Would highly recommend if you want Thai in Toronto.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer C.,"Probably hands down the best Thai place - and definitely my go to, if you don't mind the noise during peak hours.
I've been a couple times during off-peak hours, and it was definitely a lot quieter.
For a first time customer, the squash fritters are a must - I seriously regretted it after opting for another appetizer during my first visit!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny H.,"I came here on a Tuesday night and did not have to wait long to get a seat. All the regular tables were taken and the restaurant was very lively around 8:00, so the host offered us the hightop tables which we happily agreed. The hightop table seats 6 so we took one side and another party of 3 came in about half an hour later. We had ample room but still got the communal dining experience.
The owner/manager came up to us to take our orders, was very curteious and laidback, I did not feel rushed but I did notice that he really wanted us to order some drinks/alchol.
We both ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and the squash fritters (gorbang) to share as an app. Our food arrived quite quickly and was steaming hot which was awesome.
Squash Fritters: Fritters were piled high and and the dipping sauce was amazing. It's not as sweet as sweet potatoe fries but still has the ""fries"" texture. The only downside is that I though the batter was a little too thick given how thinly sliced the squash were. It was also a bit on the oily side for my taste. This does not eat like a vegetable dish in my opinion.
Pad Thai: Very hot, very nicely presented and the use of shredded cabbage instead of raw beansprouts was great. It gives the noodles a more refreshing, even cruchier texture without getting that raw vegetable taste if it was just raw beansprouts. I thought the pad thai was a bit on the saltier side, and there is much more prominent use of spices than other pad thai's I've had (such as Khao San Road).  This is really up to personal taste. I really enjoyed it, but it is not my abolsute favourite pad thai that I will have dreams about :p I see a lot of people ordering the coconut curry so that's what I'm trying next.
Thai Iced Tea: We decided to order one to share because we were already quite full after the main course and the appetizer. The ice tea comes in a big tall glass with crushed ice. Very sweet, and very rich and flavourful. THIS is the best thai ice tea I've had hands down. Other places seem to dilute theirs but not here. Even though the first server forgot to bring it out to us, when we told the owner/manager about it he immediately brought us one and it was delish. BIG thumbs up. Again, very promiment use of the spices in thai iced tea so it is up to personal taste whether you like it that strong. If you ask me, I am a big fan :)
Our bill came to $25 per person including tip. This is not an easy area to park, we did not see any street parking nearby so the best bet is to park at the public parking garage at Pearl & University. This is great if you are catching a movie at the Scotiabanks afterwards. 
Overall, I would definitely come back if I'm looking for some great thai iced tea, good curry, and a cool place to have a casual bite",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chevy-deli C.,"Ok We're on this fabulous road trip into Toronto, our first trip there , after wondering this magnificent city , like any good tourist we got Hangry yes Hangry, my first officer ""#1"" my lady Deli , whips out her ""tricoder"" and begins to break down a comprehensive analysis of the area granting us many choices of restaurants of which seem to be a lot in Toronto . She immediately zoned in on Pai . So coordinates lock we went ... warp factor 1 and a half left foot, right foot blammm there's a line coming out of the place , a line . Now we're from planet Brooklyn a line usually means ""ain't nobody gots time get dat"" but ... we waited. We got inside they politely gave us a buzzer and escorted us to the bar to wait for our seats   Before we could settle bebeep , wait time 15 mins , we thought fo sho it would be like 35-  45 min wait . They got points for that . Nothing like realizing you don't have to wait , cause damn we Hangry , we sat , we ordered and we ate and loved the entire experience . The music was dope, I'm olskool they was pumping Buju and Shabba , the flavor and ambiance was very Brooklyn 90's chic shon' I felt at home . We ordered the chicken satay which was delicious and flavorful, a lot softer then I like my chicken satay but it was yummy and it had a very homed cooked feel to it , my main course was the Khai soi I had it with the shrimp, delicious flavorful beautiful coconut milk curry with egg noodle nom nom . Again that Home cooked Thai food feel . Now the whole time we've been there there had been a line outside the door and that was about a little over an hour. As we left a patron asked how was the meal?  yaddadyadda , we told him it was awesome , during our exchange I noticed he was one of the people in a picture , a collage of photos telling the story of Pai I mistakenly thought that he was the son of the owner, only to find out that he was the owner , mega bonus point my friend , you work with your people and care about it with passion , I  bow to you sir amazing place you've created .
, we will return now please bring Pai to Brooklyn , I'll help you . On the reals!!! Now I'll let my first officer Deli debrief you ... i'm going to make this real simple; The wait was short, the ambience was great, the food was amazing, 1st mate and Captain very happy.  Best day ever!!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dean W.,"I've had take-out from Pai many times for lunch at work. 
My favourite is the beef pad gra prow. The beef and rice taste so good together. I'm also a fan of the pad thai. I like that you can specify how spicy you want each dish.
The prices are fair for the quality of the food. Other places will charge less for the same dishes, but they're not as good.
Because this place is so popular, the wait times even for take out are very long at the busy times of day, so make sure you plan for this and order early.
I've never sat down to eat there but it strikes me as very noisy whenever I've been there to pick my food up at lunch on weekdays.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shereé C.,"Can I just tell you that I love this place. I've only been here once, but I can tell that this place is popular, so we had to wait for a table - this was around lunch time.  I really liked the atmosphere, which was relaxed and they played 90's rap and r&b hits that day (good times!) I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork and it was absolutely delish.  I wouldn't change anything about that dish.  Our server was also great, she came by frequently to make sure we were good. If you don't mind the music and crowd, I would definitely recommend this place.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ayumi S.,"So far, my husband and I have visited few times. 
Although we waited for a hour and half to get a table, we really love their Pad thai, Squash fries, Spring roll, Tom yum soup. 
And it is consistently amazing. 
Most of our visit, service is quite friendly and we really love the atmosphere of Thailand at Pai. 
Highly recommended!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joey C.,"There is an obvious disconnect between this place and me as oppose to many others. However, as with the many examples of successful ethnic eateries as of late; the key to raving reviews is really approach-ability. The recipe for success goes something like this; take some average Thai food, plate it fancily, dim the lights, make the space warm, rustic and industrial AND lastly turn up the music. I can't say this food is bad nor is it delicious though the curry is quite adequate. However, considering the price I had to pay I would say they have woefully underachieved.
Let's start with the classic Pad Thai -- the dish that is fried rice is to Chinese food, sushi is to Japanese food...etc. If there is one dish to be done right, it would be this. It was quite a disappointment to say the least, probably one of the most amateur interpretations I've had. The noodles have been chopped up too short and have become ""clumpy"" (they've overcooked it and when you do that the noodles tend to break up and clump up during the stir fry process). The flavours were extremely muted and it was as bland in both presentation and taste as you can imagine it. Luckily, we had an assortment of curries and for the most part they did a good job on the sauce itself. What was disappointing was the dry unflavourful proteins and absence of any sort of substantial vegetables to add some pop and freshness to the dishes. Do note that the curries taste very similar so it may not make a difference which one you pick; so just get it in your favourite colour? There are reasons why curries come in different colours and it's not just to please your eyes. Those wings, those tiny wings that cost almost a buck and half each were awfully over-hyped. They were tender but that's about where it ends. I couldn't make out what flavours they were; it was like a mis-mash of various random spices and herbs that equate to not very memorable, confusing and strange tasting wings. I guess there was a hint of lemongrass in it and that was nice. I've saved the best for last and it was the tom yum soup. Everything was on point except for the oddly sized pieces of lemon grass it comes with. Not quite small enough to ignore yet not quite big enough to be easily removed. If anyone has chewed on lemongrass, you will understand how pleasant it can be.
So behind all the smoke and hype, behind all that hippy, happy, lounge-y vibe what you have is an overpriced and mediocre meal.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren K.,"Best Thai food I have had in years. We are in town from LA and felt that this was superior to anyplace back home. We had Chicken Pad Thai (creamy, full of flavor), Beef Noodle (spicy rich broth and tender beef pieces), Veggie Green Curry (herbaceous coconut flavor and nice spice). All dishes were excellent! We would come back again for the amazing food, great service, and cozy atmosphere!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danny T.,Delicious and authentic Thai cuisine. It's lit.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mariam J.,"The vibe, the food, the staff- I love this place. Make a reservation beforehand, it's always packed. The menu for non meat eaters is limited but still yum stuff!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica S.,"Came here on a busy Thursday night with a few friends.
We ordered the Grabang to share and I personally had their Pad Thai.
Grabang was delicious! Perfect balance between salty, sweet and crispy and soft - just the way I like my fries.
I really liked my pad thai, but personally would have preferred it a little sweeter. It was a huge portion though - I could only get through half of it.
Their Thai Iced Tea is also refreshing.
I will definitely be back to try their curry.
Servers were all attentive and helpful. For ambiance, the set up was very cozy. It made for easy conversation. However it was fairly dark at our table making it hard to even see the menu/the food in front of us. We could have used another candle.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jillian S.,"On our trip to Toronto, we stopped here because it was somewhat near our hotel and had good reviews. We managed to get a spot at the bar-- try and make a reservation! It fills up fast and for good reason.
The service was wonderful and friendly. We both ordered the Pad Thai (no spice and mild, which had quite a kick!) and the Winter Dog, which was a great drink!
It's a little loud here, but not in a bad way. Just a lot of happy folks chatting. The food was delicious and the portion generous for the price. They take card. 
We'd for sure go again! Thanks for making our last dinner in Toronto a great one, Pai! :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mathangi S.,"The menu is very inclusive, with clear indication of which meals can be made vegan (a green V found next to the menu item). Despite being initially impressed, I was left disappointed with my Khao Pad Thamada which is a stir fried jasmine rice dish.
After making sure with my waitress that the Khao Pad Thamada could be made vegan and that it would not be made with the usual egg and oyster sauce to accomodate my dietary preferences, I was very disappointed to discover egg in my meal. And lots of it. I'm assuming it contained oyster sauce as well since again, the meal is usually made with it. Since I cannot identify the taste of oyster sauce (having never tried it), I can only assume.
I gave Pai two stars instead of one because I would like to believe their effort in creating an inclusive menu would mean that this is not a typical occurence.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vivian C.,"I've been to PAI more than a handful of time now and it never disappoints. Food is always delicious, their Thai iced tea is a must try! Wait time are over an hour if you arrive after 6pm, so try for an early dinner. Service is ok - can be slow sometimes. If you're looking for a more secluded, quiet meal, this is NOT it; tables are super close to one another and it gets quite loud.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tim W.,This place lives up to the hype. I chose to get the spring rolls and a curry. Both were amazing! The vibe of the restaurant is also pretty great.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alan M.,"Visited Pai with some buddies. It was recommended however I walked in being sceptical since I wanted to go to Khao San Road. I would later find out that Pai has the same owners as KSR! What!!! The place was spacious and quiet (we went for lunch on a Sat). 
We ordered up a Pad Thai, a Peanut Sauce Beef, a dish with chicken and rice and some Squash Fritters. We should have went spicier, I think we said medium. Which was not spicy to us. The dishes weren't very hot (temperature wise) but that didn't bother me. They were ready to eat and came in beautiful dishes. Also the water bottle they give you whistles when you pour it!
Everything was really good, I would recommend Pai to anyone. I definitely need to go back. No regrets, great experience! 
Two thumbs up!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren H.,loved the pad Thai and chai tea cocktail ! Went with friends on a Friday night and did not disappoint,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pamela D.,What an awesome place!!! The food amazing!!! The attention fantastic. Even the side rice was unbelievable!!! I want to move here just to go often there.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ali M.,On point...great service and good vibe... you won't be disappointed but it's also not the best Thai food of your life,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura S.,Yummy Thai food but super hard to get into (for good reason) no matter what night of the week. The Pad Thai is of course amazing and also love the pad gra prow. Plan ahead to go on off hours if you want a table!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve C.,"We went on a Sunday night in May 2015 and had a 40 minute wait. We just walked around the area and enjoyed the weather. We were seated at the promised time and had prompt and good service from an actual Thai waitress. Not all the staff are Thai. We had spring rolls, two different pad Thai dishes and all was delicious. The seating and tables are spartan and not comfortable. That's a reason why I don't give it 5 stars. I will eat here again though. The food is very good and service is excellent.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Parmita S.,"Never coming back again! Here' why:
1. extremely slow service - took over 15mins for our drinks to arrive, another 20 mins later 1 extremely small appetizer dish arrived and then another 25-30 mins later the food arrived. That's over an hr of waiting before the main course
2. bad drinks - their Cesar tastes bitter! I couldn't drink more than half of it
3. After all the wait and bad drinks, the food was OK but a but overpriced! 2 drinks, 1 tiny app and 2 dinner dishes aren't worth $70+ tip if theres bad service, bad drinks and avg tasting food. Even the restaurant isn't all that great! They cheaped out on the ambiance, very uncomfortable chairs esp when we have to wait an hr for food; could have at least hired more cooks/servers!",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wai L.,"Came here for dinner on a Thursday evening (6pm).
Atmosphere/decor, I find the decor a bit odd, almost hodge podge.  It may be due to how little I know about what Thailand looks like, but the decorations just seem a bit random and odd to me.  Exposed brick, random pennants in the ceiling, Bob Marley playing in the background.  The seating is a bit tight, so, do expect to hear your neighbours unless you are in the high tables off to the side.
Food, ordered the grabong (I thought they were okay, but our tastes mostly of batter, I did like the sauce which was sweet and a little bit spicy), pad thai (I can't really comment on this, we ordered medium spicy and it was a bit more spicy than expected, tastes like pad thai that I'd had at many other thai restaurants, nothing amazing), and the green curry (decoration is interesting, although because it is in a coconut, it doesn't hold that much so they bring out more curry in a small bowl, seems a bit odd, I thought the curry was good though).  Also got a thai beer and a thai ice tea which I thought was interesting (this is my second time having one and it tastes sweet with a lingering bitterness at the end) but do note that there is a LOT of ice in the cup, so even though it is big, you don't actually get that much.
Service, they seemed pretty attentive to us, no issues with them coming timely to take our order, ask for our opinion on the food and refill drinks as well as taking away our dishes when finished.
Cost, for two drinks, two mains, and one appetizer, it cost us roughly $60 which I think is a bit much for thai food, but when I compare it to nearby offerings, it is within range.
I don't see myself coming back here, although I may not understand and appreciate thai food as much as others do.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gautam J.,"Been here many, many times, and have never had less than a 5-star experience, far from even one disappointment.
While the unique Northern Thai dishes they do are quite different from your generic Thai restaurant, the usual suspects like Green Curry, Massaman have a unique flavour about them too.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Crystal K.,"This restaurant has amazing vibes. There is always a long wait but the food is always worth it. You have to get squash fritters, the mango juice (secret!), and the pad grow prao (rice dish with pork). Also ordered the soup noodles once and that was also amazing. Great place for a date or just chill vibes with friends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mary H.,"Best wings in Toronto. Penang curry w/shrimp, garlic shrimp, and pad thai were sensational. Crispy pork with rice was a little too oily for me. Overall, excellent, just wish I had asked for the spiciest option; farang was too mild for me. Excellent service. Amazing drink (lowry).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt L.,"The food is good but not quite to the hype it gets and the line is wild. Definitely need a reservation or come by for lunch right when they open. I would definitely come back but probably only with a bigger group, it's a pretty lively place so better suited for a dinner with friends than a casual evening.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ellie J.,"I walked in alone and sit in the bar for a 3:30pm late lunch on a Friday. The place is surprisingly not packed. The setting is nice. And the fold menu doesn't seem to be too extensive. I had the Tom yum soup, the stirfry with tofu and a beer. Came to around 43 bucks including taxes and tips, definitely more expensive than I normally encounter in Toronto. I am from New York City so I would say I had a fair share of good Thai food. I was slightly disappointed. The food is good but I wasn't sure why this place is so popular.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mofeed A.,One of the best Thai restaurants in the city. Busy lineups during dinner time but you won't regret it. Must try if you like Thai food.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Roland F.,"Been here many times before and after going to Crocodile Rock. There's a good amount of flavor in each bite of their Pad Thai. Between Pai,Sukho Thai and KSR, you can't go wrong.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Javo M.,"I had a great meal, really wonderful flavours in a very comfortable and friendly setting. I'm in TO on business could eat here every trip. I had the rolls, the wings and the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup. I found the tamarind, beef, lime and chilly very well balanced, very hearty and spicy enough - I like it very spicy usually. Try the pomegranate tequila moscow mule too!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cherryl K.,"Really, really tasty food! Great flavours. Busy on the weekends, so service can be a bit slow and inattentive - but the food makes it worthwhile.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie P.,"It's a bit loud, a bit crowded but the food is fantastic.   We tried to eat at 3pm to avoid the crowds yet there was still a small wait of about 15 minutes.   The pad Thai is just about perfect and you can control your spice level",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shaz K.,"After seeing multiple check ins from friends waited 1 hr to be seated for dinner. Ordered the Lowry at the bar which was really good. Food was amazing. Ordered pad thai, green curry, khao soi, braised beef. Service was great: from the host to the bar tender to the waitress.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike C.,"Excellent food, great atmosphere, and awesome vibes. Don't get the Thai Bucket drink, it's gross, but everything else was awesome! Go team!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris d.,"great deal if a northern thai restaurant. very nice atmosphere, staff and cuisine. the thai ice tea is a must.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fatima A.,Hands down best Thai food I've had in a long time! Everything we had was delicious. Specific to northern Thai cuisine.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chloe O.,I tried this restaurant with my aunt as I had read incredible reviews. We were both very disappointed with the food - there was absolutely no spice so it was bland! The service was OK - the wait time was very long both to get a table and to receive our food. It was so noisy that we could barely hear each other. Unfortunately I would not go back :-(,2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katia S.,I was looking for good Thai place for several years. And I finally found it. The food is beyond Amazing! In relation to price especially this is as good as can be!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vicky H.,Really busy last night. Remember to call for reservation. Waited 45 minutes to get seated for 3 people. But the food was really good!! Worth the wait!! Yum!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew C.,"Toronto's Thai scene has really heated up to a solid five chillies out of five chillies.  
We started off with Tom Yum Soup starter size.  The soup was fantastic and a perfect blend of sweet, savoury and spicy.  There were two pieces of shrimp in the soup too.
As an appetizer, we ordered Morning Glory (aka Water Spinach).  The vegetables were cooked well and weren't too fibrous.  It was a little bit greasy but it had a very tasty garlic base.
For mains, we ordered 3 different dishes: the Chef Nuit's Pad Thai, Khao Pla Tawt and Beef Noodle Soup.
Chef Nuit's Pad Thai was pretty darn good.  Portion size was good and chicken was plentiful.  It was solid through and through.  No complaints.
The Kaho Pia Tawt is fried basa fish.  The fish was really crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  It was served with two sauces (fresh chili and tangy tamarind) and a bowl of rice.  This dish is a bit heavy.
The beef soup was also really good.  The broth was a little bit sour, a little bit sweet and despite the fact that we ordered it ""foreigner spicy,"" it wasn't spicy at all.  The beef brisket was variable in texture.  Either too dry or good and juicy.  The quality of the cuts wasn't really top tier but overall good.
The spiciness consistency was a little bit off.  Two different dishes were ordered with the same spiciness level but one dish wasn't really spicy at all, where as the other one produced the satisfying tongue numbness I'd expect.
Decor was certifiably hipster rustic chic with reggae playing in the background.  Bird whistles can be heard when pouring the bottles of water.  Bathrooms were clean and service was solid.
Overall: I'd definitely come back again.  it's another solid Thai restaurant that you can go to.  They accept reservations too.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ali W.,"Tho the food is good, the dinning room is too messy. Well for a person who likes things perfect it's a headache. Service is super casual, food is great.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eny K.,Their pad thai is good but the portion is a bit small.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ryan G.,"Love the vibe, love the green coconut curry, love the beef noodle soup. It's all good. Always leave feeling like I couldn't eat another drop.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lily L.,Had take out and it was soooo good! Though if you are eating with kids who are messy beware that the food will stain clothes!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea C.,"My fave restaurant. I like going to the Market as there are no lines (whereas the restaurant always has a line). I've tried most of the dishes at the market and the green curry is my favourite.
I also like to enjoy it with a Thai iced tea.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kim P.,"This place is so highly rated, our expectations were not met. We have our local favorite Thai places, and what we ate here was good, but not tremendous. The atmosphere is loud, so anyone planning to eat here needs to know that.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sylvia L.,"Wow, after I visited Thailand I thought I would never be able to taste the same quality of pad thai and curries again.  Well, Pai comes pretty close to the same quality of food that I had in Thailand.  The portions are quite large, service is fast, and the atmosphere in the restaurants reminds me of a small restaurant on Khao San Road in Bangkok.  I recommend getting there early for dinner service on Fridays, as it was pretty packed at 5:00pm.  Reservations were almost impossible to come by.  The price is a little more on the higher end, but the portions are large enough.  Definitely a go to Thai restaurant.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alan W.,"I went here last week and they had only been open (a soft opening) for just a few weeks. They didn't have their liquor license ready yet, but that was just fine as I was really impressed with their food. The water carafes at the table made a bird chirping sound when you pour it which we thought was cute.
Walking into the restaurant, I was a caught a little off guard as it didn't really look like a Thai restaurant. It had a very casual vibe to it with lots of wood paneling and travel knick knacks everywhere, not all of it Thai. It was almost like a mix of Tex Mex meets Tiki bar, but there was a table for six near the front that was elevated with a low table with floor cushions. My group wanted to be seated there as it would be cool to eat while sitting on the floor, but there was too many of us.
The waitor was excellent as he did an excellent job describing the dishes, which had some kind of story or meaning as they were dishes that the husband and wife chef served or created from their homeland and one dish was almost a love story between the two. It was great to hear that the dishes are prepared with love and soul, and it tasted just as good.
I ordered the green coconut curry with basa fish which was served in a whole coconut. I really love the rich flavours and the lime leaf and other Thai aromatics. You could order any dish with any level of spiciness (5 levels), from no spice to Thai spice. I ordered mine Thai spice as the waitor mentioned that it wouldn't overpower the dish while still getting a good amount of heat that will make you sweat. I thought it wasn't that spicy which was fine as the curry flavor was so good and there is also some homemade Thai chili sauce at the table which you could add yourself.
After our meal we were treated to the mango sticky rice pudding, which was sticky rice with a green hue from the Pandam extract, which gave it a nice almost coconut flavor and scent, and was topped with sliced ripe mangos. I thought it was nice, though a few people in my party had some aversions to rice pudding. Unfortunate for them, but lucky for me! 
Prices were very reasonable and their cocktail menu looked really interesting. It's a great casual unpretentious restaurant with a fun atmosphere.
I will definitely be back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sebastian L.,"Another great Thai places in Toronto! They have a nice variety of southern Thai dishes with a nice twist of creativity. Great atmosphere, but sometimes a bit difficult to get service. Hard to comment on the food, since almost everything has been said in the other reviews. 
Definitely a place to check out if you are craving Thai. Price's are a bit high but can't fault due to it's location.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David R.,"This is the best Thai food I've ever had. There will definitely be a wait, but the food is worth it. They also have great mixed drinks, beer and wine. Must go!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elisha M.,Food and service was amazing! Got seated quickly. Loved the drinks also! Cool atmosphere.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susan S.,"Fantastic food, reasonably priced. Their curry and noodles are definitely on the sweeter side, but super flavourful. Plenty of vegan options. Recommend making a reservation ahead of time because they are always quite packed.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Heather G.,"The food is delicious. We ordered spring rolls, pad thai, and chicken fried rice. I would order from here again, but I wouldn't eat at the restaurant again.
I made a reservation weeks in advance for two, when we arrived we were scrunched together in an area of two seater tables, I felt like my husband and I were on a date with other couples. The music was good, but loud and so it was hard while we waited. We ordered large glasses of water which were never brought, and then had to ask for a refill more than once with the small glasses which gets annoying when you're trying to enjoy a dinner and order something spicy.
All in all the food did not disappoint, I would certainly order my dish again - but the odd set up/bad service was enough to turn me off to eating in the dining room.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sally K.,"The thing is, I really do love Pai - but only when I dine in. The difference in food quality between take-out and dine-in is noticeable and bordering on ridiculous, so much so that it's driven me to join Yelp and write my first review.
I always order the Pad Thai with tofu and veggies, Thai spicy. The two times I've dined in, the spice and heat of the dish were on point - my mouth was just on the cusp of catching fire, precisely the way I like it. Take-out, on the other hand, is bland, totally lacking in flavour. The noodles are barely coated in sauce and the dish as a whole just looks and tastes watered down.
I don't know what's causing this inconsistency and considerable difference in quality, but I hope they're able to identify and address it. Otherwise, Khao San Road will be my go-to whenever my Thai craving hits.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melody M.,"Amazing thai food ! Very authentic and not your typical thai like your Thai Express ! 
Ive tried different restaurants under this group and Pai is definitely the best hands down. You must try the curry noodle ( khao soi ) wow that is the best thing on the menu and no one else can beat it . The pad gra was also good but its nothing spectacular as its just minced meat over rice and fish sauce . The morning glory ( stir fried vegetables) is out of this world ! Its a must !!! 
Avoid the lettuce wraps and spring rolls as they are not great nor bad but you can def do without and try something else ! 
And finally the tom yum soup is very authentic and def worth getting !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erin P.,"Came here 3 times in the span of 3 weeks. 
With high expectations, there was no one dish that disappointed.
Coming with a large group means we got to try lots of different things. I loved all their apps, but my favourite was the mango salad, so much flavour in that one dish! Loved all their mains, regardless if its the Khao soi, Green curry, or noddle soup... all amazingly impressive with explosions of flavour. 
The only thing with thai food is that its too rich and high in salt, I always feel bloated and thirsty afterwards, but I guess its not their fault.....
Can't wait to go back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Su C.,"Pros: friendly service
          Great food! The curry is a must!
          Young, hip atmosphere
Cons: gets very busy and you may have a long wait without reservation after 5:30
         Very loud
         Very cold during winter, if you can, avoid sitting anywhere near the entry door during winter months.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jamie R.,"I went to this restaurant for a change from the same old ""salad king"", and as soon as I arrived inside you could tell it was very popular and different niche in crowd. It had random photos and other random things just put all over the place. If you're looking for a quiet place don't go here as its just beaming with excitement and fun.
The place is so busy and it pushes all the servers to the limit here, but they hold their own here and do a pretty good job in all. You may want to make a reservation here early on in the day so you don't have to wait for 30mins, so don't expect to be seated in the evening right away if you don't make a reservation. 
The food is just totally to die for here from the basics of "" spring rolls"" to ""Thai noodles"" you'll enjoy each bite of whatever dish you get. It will cost a bit more than ""salad king"" but worth the extra dollars.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amritavarshini K.,Remains to be one of my top 5 picks in Toronto. Yet to have thai food in the city that can beat the standard this place set in my taste buds. I waited 1.5 hours to get a seat in the restaurant and I'd do that again to have their thai level spiced - pad gra prow!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ravitej R.,"The place is perennially packed for a reason. Anything you order is bound to be good. You can have it exactly as you want it, and they will never mess up your order regardless of how busy the place is.
Also, this is probably the most reasonably priced restaurant in the area, it almost seems underpriced.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,DeShunda J.,The food was amazing and the atmosphere was so inviting. They have traditional Asian seating I. Some areas of the restaurant. We had to take off our shoes to eat. It was great!!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tan N.,"Excellent restaurant. There's usually a bit of a wait if you don't have reservations, but the line moves quickly and the inside is very spacious. Skip the garlic shrimp and order the wings, laab salad, papaya salad, and some stir fry dishes. All really good at the minimum and it only gets better from there.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Veronica S.,"The spot was always packed when open, but the food is just ok. Its pretty good for whats available in the area, but for the price its not really worth it.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Richard A.,"Had the spring rolls, fried rice w/ veggies, pad thai w/ chicken, and khao soi w/ beef.  Standouts were the spring rolls and the khao soi (that curry sauce is so damn good).  The pad thai was really good but I've had others on par and the fried rice was good but nothing crazy (although the veggies choice might have contributed).
Would definitely come back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sabrina D.,"The atmosphere of this place is pretty eclectic in my opinion; the decorations seemed close to what you would see in a restaurant in Thailand (I'd assume, since I've never been to Thailand), and the mismatched chairs added to the appeal. They also have a cool table where there are floor cushions to sit on rather than chairs! There is also a small patio (maybe 8-12 seats). 
Although we (party of 4) were seated fairly quickly, it took a while for the servers to come ask us for our drinks and orders. Additionally, the waiters never checked up on us during the meal or offered to refill our water. I can understand not doing so when the restaurant is crazy busy, but at 2:00 on a Thursday, the restaurant wasn't too chaotic. Perhaps they were understaffed. Food also took a while to come out. 
I had the chicken pad thai (mild) and I tried a bit of the panang beef curry. While the pad thai wasn't overly saucy and the noodles had a good texture, I felt that the chicken was a bit dry, and the sauce not sour enough for my liking. Portion size was good; I was full but not bursting. The bit of panang beef that I tried was flavourful and thick, albeit, a bit too salty. 
TLDR; I would come back if I'm in the area and have a hankering for Thai, but I doubt I'd make a special trip here.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tasha S.,"I visited Pai for dinner with a group of friends mid July.  It's now August 1st and I'm writing this review after 4 subsequent visits, once with a friend, once with a work group of 17 which I organized, and 2 other lunches.  The friends I brought mid July, returned the following day with their friends.  Yes, it's that good - just like all of the Regular's restaurants (they are no longer with Khao San Road).
I'm working my way through their menu and have loved everything I've tried so far: Pad gra prow, khao soi, papaya salad, fish green curry, (super tender) beef massaman curry and the spring rolls - I can't wait to try the rest. Also, the pandan sticky rice with mango - the best I've had since I had it in Indonesia cooked in bamboo over a fire in a remote village.  
While the service at lunch for a table of 4 can be a bit slow, the servers are friendly, knowledgeable and polite. I was very impressed with how quickly they were able to accommodate our large lunch group of 17 - we were able to sit in the private room, the food came quickly and all at the same time.  Everyone was very pleased and loved the food. Separate bills were requested in advance and provided without the fuss you sometimes get. 
For me the food at Pai beats that of Khao San Road, which isn't as good as it was in the beginning. I also appreciate not having line up forever just to experience other people's conversations or poor table manners at a shared table.
Now, what am I going to try next time I'm at Pai...",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mata K.,"Great food, (I recommend the pad Thai!) drinks are a little sweet and service is slow.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jess C.,"I was very excited to try this place out because of the high ratings and great reviews on Yelp. I have to give 3/5 stars to this place because it was just alright overall. The ambiance and environment is very laid back and comfortable for friends to just let loose. The decor is nice and menus are ""laid back"" papers as well haha. I ordered the Khao Soi with chicken breast as it looked the most aesthetically pleasing through pictures. I could taste that it's a peanut-based curry under all the spices and flavourings, which is a really unique experience for my tastebuds. I can't deny that it was very salty though and since the portions are so big, I ended up very full and very dry mouthed easily. Good thing others recommended the Thai tea here, which I found to be a great addition to my meal and my friends who ordered a different dish as well. The tea seems to complement many of their offerings. The servers are very sweet and prompt, but I also went during the late lunch hour (3:30pm). I might have to try other places before determining if this is worth a return trip!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Itsvy K.,"Highly recommend going to Pai for almost any occasion! 
Whether you want to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even show a stranger around, Pai is the spot. Now let me tell you why ! 
Location: Easy to find! 
If you're unfamiliar with downtown Toronto, you'll get more familiar after finding this place. Although it's not right along any of the major streets downtown, it is fairly close. And when I mean fairly close, I mean it's in between them. It's located on Duncan Street, between King and Adelaide (closer to Adelaide). 
Walk Ins: They accept walk ins, no strays, but ya gotta wait. Worth it though! 
When you get to the doorsteps of the restaurant, two things will happen. You walk down the steps of this cosy, dimly lit restaurant and get slightly intimidated by a few stares you'll receive when you walk in, but that's okay. Half of the time, the people sitting there are waiting on more guests, so they probably think you're that person.  I know, it's always a little awkward when you walk into a restaurant for the first time and not quite sure what to expect. 
You'll then get greeted by one of their awesome friendly staff and be asked how many people. Chances are, you'll probably have to be put on the waitlist. There's always a line here unless you get there before the rush. They accept reservations too but I don't have much luck in that area. 
Vibe: Good vibes all around
The ambiance of the restaurant is hip, chill and plays some pretty awesome hiphop/r&b music (at least on the nights I was there). It sets the energy for a fun, good vibes kind of a night. 
Where the cool kids sit: The corner
If you're a group of 4 and it's not so packed, there are some awesome seats tucked away on the right-hand side around the Host stand, in the corner area. Now you're probably wondering what makes them so awesome. It's the experience of it which made it much more authentic. You get to sit in this little area set up with a low table and cushions placed on the ground. I loved it, it's quite cosy, authentic and different from the usual chair method. 
Advice: It's not recommended if you have tight pants that you're not okay to rip a little, or if you're a chair person. 
What to eat: Anything, It's all pretty darn gooood
Now in terms of food, I order the same thing every time I go because you usually tend to find some of your favourite things on the menu and stick with it. The Thai iced milk tea is really good! They do tend to put a lot of ice sometimes, so I try to get that minimized every now and then (don't be like me.)
Aside from that, the food can be a little savoury at times, so if you're not used to that, it might be a little stronger for you. Personally, I love everything there. My usual is the Chef Nuit Pad Thai or the Khao Soi. 
IF you're not a fan of spice, your options may be a little more limited. They can definitely make the Pad Thai with ZERO spice, but aside from that, I found most of the other main courses to still have a mild kick to it even if you request less spice. That's when the Thai Iced Milk Tea comes in handy. 
Service: Aweeeeesome as always 
Aside from that, service has always been really great! I've never had a bad experience so far and It's always an enjoyable experience no matter what occassion.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Molly C.,"When I go for Thai in Toronto I usually anticipate food court style Thai and am often disappointed.
Pai Northern Thai is a refreshing experience and without a doubt the best Thai I've ever had.  The moo ping is excellent and the grabong is definitely a must order. The thai iced tea is delicious, though very very sweet.
The service is friendly and attentive. Overall it's a stellar spot. We'll absolutely be back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Charles G.,"I love their pad thai and wings. And coconut water. 
The pad thai was delicious. I don't see how you could say otherwise. There was nothing I could hate about the dish - it had deep herbal fragrance, spicy, hints of sweet, sour, salty and savoury.
The wings I had were a kind of dry rub with a very delicious thai sweet/spicy sauce that tasted very homemade and delicious. Like the pad thai, the flavour had depth to it. 
There are a lot of Asian places where the food might be good, but lacking in nuance and extra care in the taste. At Pai it's definitely present.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Prachy M.,"I am a vegetarian so my review doesn't apply to everyone. The food tasted alright but I've had better vegetarian at Khao San and at Sukho Tai. However, it did taste better the next day.
Ambiance and service were great though!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David A.,"Overall, great food, chilled atmosphere with casual authentic vibe, and reasonably priced.
With former Kho San Road roots, you can feel the similarities in the food and menu. Which, I should mention there is nothing wrong with. 
Beef salad, squash fritters, coconut green curry were all highlights.
Restaurant was large and spacious, which was a nice change to Kho San.
What was lacking??? The service was mediocre at best. I am willing to chalk this up to being opened recently and perhaps stiil getting there feet wet. They just seemed a bit under staffed and everything was pretty slow. Good thing I was in a slow moving kind of mood!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gaya T.,"Based on the yelp reviews I had high expectations for this place. Was disappointed. Everything was just okay- maybe my expectation was too high . We had the shrimp green curry, chicken Thai noodle dish, shrimp appetizer and the squash appetizer ! Also had the lemonade . Maybe I was having an off day - did not enjoy any of the dishes !",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Beth M.,"Thankfully I got there right after 5pm because the line was out the door. I walked down the stairs into a warm, dim space that was lively and busy! Just 1, I asked because I am alone traveling. I got seated at the bar where I was promptly served and always noticed.  Their famous Pad Thai was amazing but pricy. 1 dish $16.35. The service and environment made up for the overpriced noodle dish. I will be back to try a couple more items.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David C.,55$ for 2 and we ate very well(no alcohol). Food was delicious and the ingredients so fresh. It had an hour wait but they took our name and sent us a sms when the table was ready. Service was fast and courteous. Ambience is great! Very good experience! The only thing I would have liked is more chicken in my pad thai.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wei J.,"Restaurant doesn't take reservation, but the tables turn over quite fast.  Pad Tai and spring rolls are the best.   Service was good.  There are a good number of wait staff.  Definitely will go back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny N.,"Whenever anyone asks for my favorite thai restaurant in the heart of downtown, I will 100% recommend Pai! The food is 100% authentic and delicious, the atmosphere is amazing and the staff is wonderful. The wait time for Pai is really long, so I do recommend reservations.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rigel J.,"Food is heaven!!  I'm giving it a 5 star because the food tastes amazing, and staff are friendly and try their best to attend to their tables.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah L.,"Best memory in Toronto! Arrived at 8pm, still huge amount people waiting. We two are so luck to only wait for less than half an hour to have a seat around the bar. The food is so delicious and the drinks look beautiful. Unfortunately I was not allowed to drink for some personal reasons. But if I had the chance to Toronto again, I'm gonna definitely go to PAI to enjoy the food and drink once more!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea N.,"Excellent atmosphere, food was good. Definitely a great place to come if you're having a larger get together. There's definitely things on the menu for everyone!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Oreo Z.,Awesome Thai food - coconut water is a must-have!  It is a long wait on weekends so be prepared to wait 30-60 minutes if you arrive aroudn dinner time.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Renee L.,"Wait time was over 40 Min. Finally sat and ordered for our group of 10+.  Pad Ka Prao chicken, Tom Yum Goong, Beef Noodle soup, Pak Boong Fai Dang, Gaeong Keaw Wan, chicken satay...  soup was too spicy creamy and salty; portions were too small; satay was too sweet; pad ka prao chicken was so so....dishes took forever to get served.  Probably somewhat decent was the Pak Boong Fai Dang-  our 2nd dish was somewhat larger in portion and crispier....wouldn't come back again....over rated!!",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen Z.,"We arrived for our on line booked reservation that turned out was moved....Strange,  but even though the place was packed they still sat us within 5 minutes.   
We had the spring rolls and fritters for the apps...fantastic.  then the green curry and chef neut pad Thai   probably the best I have had.  Service was fantastic and a lively place.  Will be back  good job!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wasiu A.,Went for lunch and tried the khao soi. I wasn't disappointed. Very flavorful. I got it with the hicken breast and it was a good portion of meat.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lydia C.,"Awesome food. Casual & fun atmosphere. Super friendly & attentive servers. Good prices. Accepts resevation. 4 level of spiciness to choose from! What more could i ask for? Love this new addition to the Toronto Thai food scene, its up there with, if not better, Khao San Road, Sukho Thai, and Sabai Sabai Kitchen.
Love: Chef Nuits pad thai
Hate: I was brave and ordered the level 4 spiciness. Way too spicy but I still ate everything cause it was so delicious. The Thai Ice Tea helped tone down the spice a bit :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patrick B.,"This place is quite popular and well worth the wait. Even on a busy night, the staff can accommodate an average size party in under 30 mins. The food is fresh and I love their take on traditional Thai cuisine. This place is a must visit for travelers and if I was local i would probably eat here on a weekly basis. Decor, food and staff are awesome.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cherry C.,"TL;DR - Food came cold, appetizer came AFTER our entrees and waitress was inattentive to our table.  Not the best first impression and will probably not be back.  My experiences at Khao San Road have been far superior in food and service.
---
I've been meaning to try Pai for a long time now since it received so much hype a few months ago. The vibe and food from the restaurant reminds me a lot of Khao San Road with slight differences.  I came here on a Sunday night at 6:30pm for a group of 4 and we did make reservations 3 weeks in advance!  The restaurant is easy to spot on Duncan St. but there's limited parking on the actual street.  You may find better luck parking on the side streets of Richmond or Adelaide or King... but if you're up for a further walk, there is actually free parking just north of Queen.  
The restaurant itself is bigger than I imagined.  It fits probably 50 people (with reasonable space between the tables) in the dining area and along the bar.  It is in the basement of a building though and there is patio seating.  It's pretty loud inside (throughout the entire meal) but that's to be expected.   
Our order:
Thai Iced Tea - Very sweet but very flavorful.  I would recommend asking for less sugar or waiting for the ice to melt.  
 Gai Satay - Pretty much just a few chicken pieces on a skewer.  Was not impressed... food came out cold and the peanut sauce is just mediocre.  For 4 people, it's a skewer per person but also $3/skewer!  
Sai Ua Platter - Probably my biggest complaint and let-down for the night.  This dish came out cold as well and AFTER our entrees! Our waiter didn't seem that knowledgeable when we asked her what it was and we still had no idea how to eat it when it came.  I wish they explained how we were supposed to enjoy it properly since it came in parts.
Khao Soi - My favorite from Khao San Road and definitely not my favorite from Pai.  It was small, very few noodles but a lot of sauce/curry and ""other stuff"" but not enough meat.  Disappointed.  Also came out cold...
Gaeng Kiaw Wan - The curry itself was flavorful but a little more viscous than I would've liked.  Not enough rice to soak up all the curry (or to share).  The presentation was cool though and we attempted to eat the coconut meat with little success - I think they hollowed it out already.
My impression of Pai was average at best for the food portion and I would leave it at that if not for the service we received.  My biggest complaint from the evening came from our COLD food and our waitress' lack of attention.  We ordered two apps and one came AFTER our entrees were already done and someone removed our plates/cutlery.  We asked time and time again but the waitress would just return and say ""Did you get it yet?"".  When we did get our order, we were already upset that it was also cold and we didn't know how to eat it (waitress clearly didn't either).  Needless to say, we didn't leave very satisfied or terribly full. The food portions are relatively small in general so I wouldn't recommend sharing entrees.
For the entire meal, we paid almost $80 total before tip (about $20/person) and that's on the high side for Thai food in my opinion.  We sat there for probably 45 mins longer than we should've  just because our app was late.  Even though their menus may be similar, the service and food aren't up to the standard I'm used to at Khao San Road.  After the meal, I posted my disappointment on IG and the owner of Pai actually responded! They apologized and offered me a free entrée if I ever visited the restaurant again.  I appreciate the owner being reactive to my comments, but they should've been more proactive while we were there.  The waitress (and busboys and other wait staff) knew that we were upset so there's no reason why they couldn't have said anything while we were dining; that would've been a more impactful apology. Anyway, for that follow-up, I give them one more star than I think they deserved, but I will still probably not go to Pai again.  I don't live downtown and the journey to venture there is more of a hassle than it's worth.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Momo D.,"Came here in a group of 10 and none of them left unsatisfied. This is my first Thai restaurant and Im hooked! I ordered Grabong (squash fritters? Good for 6 people) for $11 and Braised Beef Curry (curry fan here!) for $15. Both were very delicious! I wish I had made my curry spicy tho since they have that option, so make sure you do that! Im giving it a 5 because food, place and service was enjoyable (""Vin Diesel of Pai"").",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maxim N.,Amazing amazing amazing Thai food. Been here a few times now and the kitchen is unbelievable. Everything is so fresh and flavorful but at the same time simple and authentic. Try the oxtail its very tender and delicious. Service is fast and friendly. Can't wait to go back. Go with a few people so you can share all the different apps.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Albert R.,"I have no idea how people are rating places to eat anymore. It could be that I am getting old and or Jaded. I travel for work and eat it quite a bit, so I have some perspective on these things. The line out the door and the wait for seating are unwarranted. The food is decent. Granted, I didn't live in Thailand, but I have visited the country, been to the markets and had traditional Thai food, both in the restaurants and home cooking. This ain't either of those. It is ok, but they are not using ok prices, and the service was lackluster. I accepted seating as the bar since I was alone. I had the curry chicken and the grabong. The curry comes out served in a coconut, which is both unnecessary and inconvenient, but it keeps the options small. The grabong is supposed to be a signature app. The someone ran low on the main ingredient, so it ended up coming out with the curry. It is described as a tempura preparation. This couldn't be further from accurate. It is more like sweet potato fries, and mine actually came out clumped together. The best part of the meal was the Thai milk tea and a twist there do in the Mexican mile cocktail. Combine this with the price and the wait and I can't justify any more than two stars.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer R.,"Food was delicious! It was a bit loud inside when we went, so if you're looking for a quiet place this isn't it. The place has lots of energy so if that's what you're looking for its a great spot. Delicious food and cocktails. Will definitely be back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Graeme B.,"Awesome environment, very friendly staff, and incredible food.  The curry in a coconut was awesome and a cool experience.  Also liked the squash fritters.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tiffany C.,"Great atmosphere, very live, and loud, but not to the point where you are shouting your lungs out. 
I have tried many Pad Thai's at different restaurants in the GTA, but this one still is yet to be the best! I also tried Khao Soi, however it was lukewarm when they brought out. I informed the waiter, they apologized and reheated the dish. (that's why they lost a star) 
Although it was reheated, it tasted amazing. 
Sticky rice is a must get too!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kaja B.,Probably the best Thai food I've ever had. Amazing atmosphere. Good prices. And the cocktails are pretty great too. Such a unique place!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,john s.,Really great thai in a funky downstairs spot. Larb salad was top notch.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mitch S.,"Pad Thai was fantastic, just the right moisture!
Spring rolls was a bit too heavy, but still delicious",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alice W.,"Love love love love! I'm still on my thai food craze coming back from Phuket and this place definitely is authentic, flavorful, and worth all the hype! The decor is colorful and welcoming - although it does get a little darker in the evening (hence my pictures)  the khao soi, ox tail and pad gra grow is a must try! Simple ingredients done great",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brian Y.,Great spot in a great location in downtown TO.  Ox tail curry was my favourite diah but everything was excellent.  Also for dessert they hand the mango pandan sticky rice which was an interesting flavour.  Great service as well and the owner (i think) let us have a free dessert after scoring a free throw in a Mini basketball net.  Dunno if thats gonna be ongoing though.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zeynep Ş.,"The food is delicious! The service is good and the atmosphere is inviting. 
I had the braised beef peanut curry and green papaya salad. I still think Thai Country Kitchen on Spadina has the best green papaya salad and sticky rice but they are in different categories. 
I can't wait to go back and try other things!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rebecca W.,"What can you say about any of Chef Nuit's restaurants? They're all amazing.
The only downside was that my friend ordered the green curry and was expecting it in a coconut as ordered but they were out of coconuts but didnt let us know which they really should have. Also they were out of the pork belly the first time I went so I had to get something else. 
Overall she makes the best Thai at all her (former and present) establishments!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason M.,"Service:
Hostess was quick to address you and your party. The wait was a bit long even on a weekday. But you can walk around the area grab drink and the hostess will call you once your table is ready.
Ambiance:
A nice relax environment with dim lighting. A good place for friends to hang and a good meal.
Food:
If you had ever tried other Thai restaurants in the area like Khao San Road or Sukho Thai, Pai Northern Kitchen is pretty much on par. They have a similar menu as Khao San Road. The Squash Fritters and Khao Soi are must tries!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lena D.,"The wait is very long- not only that their food is very sweet... its not bad but its like eating candy sweet, not much of a fan but their tom yum soup is on point def recommend. Unless you like sweet food I dont recommend the second curry with potatoes and the golden curry with fried noodles",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Troy F.,"Always great food!! 5 star for the vibe too, music, art, high and low tables, always happy to bring people here especially if they usually order Pad Thai as that is great but also the menu is packed with good options.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristine T.,"Best Thai food in Toronto (and would even say it's one of my favourite restaurants now).  The interior is awesome, service is great and food is so full of flavor. Tried chef nuit's pad Thai, khao soi and the squash fritters so far. Will definitely be back to try some more.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jimmy H.,Busy spot but great Thai food. Had the Pad Gra Prow and the Khao Soi another time - both have been phenomenal. Down to earth decor,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dennie I.,"The interior is similar to a dive restaurant. It's fairly clean with a mix of high seat tables or regular tables. Having come on a friday night at 8:30pm it was quite busy. The wait was well over 45min, but the server said he could text me when my table was ready. Luckily my friend suggested we sit at the bar as the servers had no problem serving food there. We got our menus and have to say that this place is a little more on the expensive side. It won't break the bank, but can you put that much added value?
We got the Gaeng Hunglay - Ox Tail, Pad Thai, and chicken skewers. the food came out really quick even though the restaurant was so busy. The skewers tasted great and it came with peanut sauce and a sweet/vinegar based dip with thai chili's inside. The peanut sauce was well made and authentic instead of taking a glop of peanut butter and blending it with some hot sauce. The vinegar based sauce tasted great as well and my friend practically drank the sauce. The pad thai tasted as expected, the portion wasn't too big, but satisfying. A good mix of chicken, sprouts and everything else evenly throughout. Nothing stood out from it and the ""foreigner spicy"" translated to mild. The Gaeng Hunglay was something else though, think curry, but a little sweeter and hints of ginger. I thoroughly enjoyed that dish more then the pad thai 
Thai cuisine doesn't have a lot of expensive ingredients, the pad thai costs around 15$ and it wasn't special or outstanding enough for me to order it again. However, the Ox tail was delicious and if I were to come again and I would definitely order something along those lines.For authenticity this place would be 4.5/5 for Thai cuisine",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patricia G.,"Although I prefer Sun in Buffalo, this was a great choice.  Very trendy, busy because I guess word gets around.  My guests and I each ordered a separate entree and shared, based on the waitress' recommendations.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bill S.,"4.5 stars on Yelp so I had to try this place. I was in town last week and the line was out the door ALL NIGHT!  This week (Tuesday) I caught a short line, but if you are one or two only you can eat at the bar without waiting. If you want a date night, make a reservation. The bartender told me for Friday and Saturday they are booked a month in advance. I had the Pad Thai noodles (of course) and they were awesome. I paired it with a Ransack the Universe by #collectiveartsbrewery and they were yummy together. Beware though, if you ask for the noodles ""spicy"" they are SPICY!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chut D.,Excellent food. Tasty & close to authenticity. Nice cozy ambience. Good service. Serving is just a bit small for the price. Overall i enjoyed the experience!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erin C.,"Now this place was awesome! Very cool vibe, busy and excited energy. Ordered spring rolls (best I've ever had), tom yum soup (really nice broth, too much fish sauce for my hubby tho) a chicken curry and rice noodle dish. 5/5",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rich G.,Wow.  Some of the best Thai I have had.  The braised beef peanut curry was spot on.   Worth the wait.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael S.,"This is the best Thai place I've ever been to. Period. The food is INCREDIBLY good; the portions fill you up even if you only have a few bites, since it's so dense with flavor. The servers are prompt and friendly; we had multiple servers check with us if our meal was going well, and they were all very nice. The food came very shortly after we ordered it, and boy was it good. I recommend the Thai Iced Tea- basically the sweetest black tea you can imagine, except it's orange. Delicious.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Megan C.,"Delicious Thai food!!
Good service attitude and lovely restaurant, but u need to wait.
I love their green curry and pad thai.
They put curry into a coconut, which is very creative and cute, I also ate the coconut meat after i finished my curry. 
My advice is some of the meals temperature need to be hotter ;)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna L.,"Great atmosphere. There was only two of us and we showed up around 6:15 and the place was already packed! Mind you they had a lot of group reservations. So I was pretty lucky to have snagged two spots at the bar. 
Upon being seated, the bartender acknowledged us immediately even though he had a dozen drinks to make. Service was prompt. 
Our meals took a little longer than we wanted them to, but it was delicious and hot once it got to us. We probably should have ordered an appetizer. Oh well, next time! 
I had the braised beef noodle soup. The flavours were out of this world! There was a generous amount of chili flakes but that is okay with me! Generous portions of braised beef (could have been more tender but no biggy) 
My friend ordered the pad Thai. It was better than regular Pad Thai. I'm not sure what the difference between Northern Thai food is compared to the rest of the country but I like it! 
I am excited to come back with more friends. It's suggest making a reservation because, like Khao San Road, the place fills up fast and early.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mong H.,"Food taste very good and has good service. Pad Thai was delicious. One small comment I would have on the Dum Yum Gong soup is I think it should have a better plate/container than the current pot, the soup are very hard to get out from the pot.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara L.,Such a long wait that its best to make a reservation. The Pad Thai is pretty good and other menu items look good too. It's a good place however I would not wait longer than 20 minutes for seating here.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenay S.,"I had to wait approx. 3 hrs but I am still give this place a 5 stars because I believe the thai food here is better than Thailand! 
I went on a Saturday night and ordered some shots with my friends while I was waiting for a table. I ordered the tom yum starter, pad thai and the thai ice tea. Everything was delicious! 
I would recommend and come again but I would also make a reservation next time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Serge L.,"The ambience and the place are awesome. The restaurant is really spacious with different spaces. Staff was friendly and attentive. The food was good, but my dish arrived cold. This the first Thai restaurant I try in the city, I certainly hope others will be better. Personally, I don't think the quality/price ratio is there yet.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason B.,We stumbled upon Pai looking for a place to eat. Was excited to be there because we could never get a reservation. Sat at the bar and were delighted with the service. The food was excellent. Spicy. Fresh. Delicious. The place filled up faster than a bucket of water in a rain storm. Great vibe. Great food. Left feeling full and satisfied. Go eat here if you want fun times and good food.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bryan L.,"The taste of food is awesome! I'll will visit it next time. But there are too many people wait for the dinner. If u have interested it, u definitely should go earlier.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Iain F.,"This place is amazing! Let's get that out of the way. 
The food is delicious, drinks are reasonably priced with a good selection, the music is good and it always has a great atmosphere. 
For me the two highlight dishes are: Pad Gra Pow & Khao Soi. Both are full of flavour and perfect portion sizes. 
Service is great too. Perfect place to go with a group of friends for a fun night out. Just go.....",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bonus Q.,"Really love their green curry!
Mango sticky rice is a must try!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sabaa N.,"Highly recommend the squash fritters, beef khao soi, chicken green curry, and beef masaman curry. Great vibe and they have a private room for large groups which is great! However there are always line ups so I recommend going a little earlier than the usual dinner time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katie E.,"There's not much to say - this is the best Thai place in Toronto. I live in Etobicoke and it's just worth going all the way to downtown to eat here rather than go to any of the Thai places in Etobicoke. Their chicken Pad Thai is almost perfect, and the Tom Yum soup is the best in the city by miles.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diane G.,"Pai is our go-to Thai restaurant close to the Financial district.  I have never been disappointed with a meal here.  The beef in the Khao soi and the masaman curries is always tender and flavourful.  The pad Thai is great as it's not too sweet.  I usually come at lunch with co-workers and we share medium spicy dishes. This week I went for dinner with a couple of friends and I had my own dish of the masaman beef curry which I ordered ""foreigner spicy"".  It was so good.  Very spicy; enough to make me sweat and so flavourful.   It is almost always busy here so try to make a reservation before coming or come at an off peak time.  You will not regret eating at Pai!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy A.,Great place for a quick no nonsense Thai fast food. You can't go wrong with what you order at the same time I would say everything is outstanding either as you'd expect at a local joint. Their khao suy is a bit too creamy but their Tom yum and chicken satay is good,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Natasha K.,"Came back again, this time for lunch. Service was good, food was even better.
Green Curry with Shrimp: This dish originally comes with chicken but they were very accommodating when I asked if I could get it with shrimp instead. I'm so glad I got it with the shrimp. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, juicy, and succulent. I don't think I've ever had a more perfectly cooked shrimp. This has been the best green curry I've ever eaten. It is packed full of fragrant and aromatic flavors and is the perfect consistency and richness.
Gaeng Masamun with Braised Beef: Punchy, rich, aromatic, and flavorful. The beef is so tender.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karen W.,"I frequent Khao San Road, and Pai is essentially the same restaurant (although no longer connected I am told) with the bonus of accepting reservations :) it is also much better for groups due to it's size.
My go-to-dish is the Pad Gra Prao, minced meat perfectly seasoned on a bed of rice with a fried egg on top and spicy fish sauce on the side. You can customize all dishes for the level of spice. 
If it's your first time, you must try the Khao Soi; with chicken if they give you the option. Not sure why but it's noticeably better than the brisket. I would highly recommend sharing it because it is too rich to eat all of it by yourself.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie M.,"Walked in on a Saturday evening around 5pm with a friend.  We did not have reservations. The host was very gracious and advised it would be a 20 minute wait.  In less than 20 minutes they opened up a large communal table that we shared with some others.  The vibe was great and my friend and I were able to hear each other without shouting.  
We had the squash fritters and a noodle curry dish - both which were amongst the most popular items on the menu.  Both were delicious.  Next time we are anxious to try the pad thai and some of the other items on the menus.
Great atmosphere and fast service.  We will be back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea P.,"Highly recommend! Great food, atmosphere, and service. Worth the hype.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nobu W.,Classic - best thai in Toronto hands down. Prices are a bit high.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Darija G.,"AMAZING food! Lines are super long so I suggest arriving well before in order to get in, it's really the beat Thai food you'll ever have and the service is great",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tracy V.,"I was never a big fan of Thai food so when my friend booker this place for my Bday I was like ""Ehhhh, let's give it a try!"" We went there around 6pm on Saturday and it was already packed. The place was so different with all Thai place I had been too. When the food came, I was like Wow!!! Everything was so delicious! The portion was enough to fill up. The sauce was so creamy and rich. All staffs were so nice and friendly. I talked to a guy at the bar and found out that they actually bought a lot of spice and ingredients from Thailand, which costs them more but it's completely worth it. 
I would definitely highly recommend this place to everybody.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cody B.,Best food in Toronto. We go here every time. Must get the Mango Sticky rice dessert. It's divine.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashwin V.,The best Thai food in Toronto! No more no less.. we came on a packed weekend afternoon 20 minutes wait worth it! All of us were starving and we cleaned up everything on our plates.. Pad Thai and Pad Gra Prow were excellent .. I loved their fried fish with green curry.. as well.. good food = good life!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle Y.,It's okay. Standard Thai food but it's always busy and the food service takes forever.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie H.,"We arrived at 11:30am for lunch on a friday and it was already almost full. We got a table and quick friendly service. Food was delicious.  I tasted the signature curry, green curry chicken, pad Thai and chicken fried rice.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashna S.,"I was determined that Khao san road was the only Thai restaurant in Toronto that could blow my mind, but I was wrong. 
Planned to go to Pai on a Saturday night, which was a bold move. Luckily my date got there 20 minutes early so I got in straight away, surpassing the 1 hour long wait line.
The decor was one of the best I've seen. Dimly lit, with colourful art work all over, and huge but yet cozy.
I knew what I wanted from the get-go, the dish that I had in Khao san road, which I fell totally in love with- the pad gra prow. I got it with shrimp rather than tofu though. 
My date got the same but with beef. 
Despite being so busy, the server was attentive, served us water and took our order. The food arrived within a good time range. The serving size was perfect. Not too big and not too small.
Tastewise, impeccable, immaculate, unbelievable! The shrimp was spiced perfectly and then the rice topped with the fried egg just can't be faulted in anyway or form. I would rank this restaurant equivalent to Khao san for the taste of food. However, if you take ambiance, decor, and atmosphere into consideration Pai wins it! 
Definitely one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto hands down!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Madhur M.,Best Thai Restaurant in the city by far. Love the Khao Soi and the Penang Curry. The Graboung is to die for. I keep going back every month for more.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eleni M.,"Amazing authentic northern Thai food. If you go before 6 you should be able to get a table for dinner in a timely fashion - after that, be prepared to wait outside when the line forms. Great service, moderate prices and unreal flavor. One of the best khao soy's I've ever had!!! Fast service but all main dishes are made fresh so don't expect to eat and leave in 20 minutes. The Tom yum Cesar was so delicious except the cold shrimp was a bit meh. 10/10 would go again",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie D.,"I've been to Pai four times-Each time on exception of once I went without a reservation around 5 on a Friday, waited around ten minutes for a reservation, other times on a Friday the line has gone up the front steps and out the door! I've had the Chiang Mai beef soup, the pad thai, the green curry, the thai iced tea, and their mango sticky rice dessert. All portions were sizeable and the atmosphere is warm. It is a great place to dine for lunch or dinner.
Good Stuff: The beef soup, the pad thai, the green curry, the mango sticky rice. All of those dishes tasted great, and the mango sticky rice was delicious. The service is great, the staff are very attentive.
Caution: The times I have gone in the summer on a Friday night it has been lined up out the door, so be sure to reserve! Since most of the seating (two person tables/bar) are in very close proximity to each other it can get decently loud, so if you are on a first date etc. maybe go for lunch instead if you are looking for a more intimate experience. 
Overall impression: *Arnold Schwarzenegger voice* I'll be back!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vania C.,"Authentic, playful atmosphere and flavours are pretty good. We always feel a little heavy and sleepy after eating there for some reason!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicolas D.,"Oh wow. I wish I could have rated this place a 6 star restaurant, but unfortunately, I can't. The food was extremely good. We got the papaya salad and the tom yom soup for starters, then for lunch the beef curry and the pad Thai. We finished it off with mango sticky rice and coconut ice cream with some strange but awesome toppings. We're only here in Toronto for a few days, but this is definitely a MUST eat for Toronto. The service was quick and the servers were nice and spoke English fluently. Some places I've been, the servers have really strong accents, and I've had absolutely no idea what they were saying. That was definitely a plus. Also the food was very filling and well worth the money. Whether you're traveling to or live in Toronto, this is the place to go.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ryan B.,"Another place in toronto that has been taken over by the hype. Don't get me wrong food tastes very traditional, they definitely didn't dumb it down for Canadians, but with hype comes over zealous reviews so heres an honest one for you. Got the curry in that cool bowl they make out of a coconut it wasn't bad, actually kind of good. They earned their points with me in their service. Place is always super busy, due to hype, but they don't forget about the little tables tucked in the corners. People here are friendly. If you like Thai food you should check it out.  Balanced menu everything that my group got was delicious so you won't be disappointed.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leah J.,"Amazing Thai restaurant! The Somtam is spot on, I love how you can choose the levels of heat (farang, thai), the atmosphere is great too! Coconut ice cream is also quite good. There's nothing I've ordered at Pai that didn't satisfy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara P.,Consistently great food though some appetizers are overpriced for value. Stick to the generous and delicious mains! Very busy so make sure to show up earlier than your desired time.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Payman S.,"One of the best Thai foods in the Toronto area. Really nice vibe, make sure to book in advance usually there is the lineup. But their PadThai and Curries are so tasteful.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joshua G.,It was a wonderful spot for Thai food. The wait wasn't long and the waiting area had access to the bar. The food was delicious and the service was excellent.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia T.,"Since 2012 when I was in Thailand, I regularly crave Thai food so Pai was definitely at the top of my list to try out. Very popular, we were unable to secure reservations two nights in a row so we buckled and ordered via UberEats. 
It was early and we wanted to try tapas somewhere else so we did a small order of larb moo (moo is pork for reference and as Chrissy teigan once said, it's weird and doesn't explain why chicken isn't baaaaaaahhhh and lamb oink, anyways...), som tum and pad Thai. Of the three items my favorite was the pad Thai, the larb moo and the least favorite the som tum. The pad Thai was so flavorful, delicious and absolutely reminded me of the street food we had in Thailand. The larb moo was spot on with its various herbs and spices and I loved that it was served with a side of sticky rice. For me, the som tum as just a little bit too fishy. My boyfriend who is Laotian loved it though so authenticity wise, it is very authentic but just too much for me. Next time I'm in town, I am definitely making reservations before-hand so I can try their other items but overall for what we ordered I found it decent. I wouldn't say it is my first choice to go back to but it was good - just not great.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bougey B.,"Service is very slow and rough, food comes out slow.
Food is a bit too heavy and oily. Not sure why this is so overhyped.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sophia X.,"Pad Thai is always my favorite here. I tried different dishes in thsi place, generally everything is good",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Luis H.,"Pai (named after a town in northern Thailand by the Burmese border) is one of the most distinctive Thai restaurants in all of Toronto. Specializing in northern Thai cuisine (which has more of a connection with Burmese/Myanamese cuisine). Catering to large lunch and dinner crowds and with reservations sometimes booked weeks in advance (it took two weeks to land a group reservation for eight people due to the popularity of this restaurant). Offering some traditional dishes also found in southern Thailand, but with less grease than some of the places and a special touch of northern Thai cooking (e.g. fried egg on some dishes; oyster sauce), the food is so distinctive it sets this restaurant worlds apart from other Thai restaurants.
Service is great, however, please either make reservations or arrive before the lunch/dinner crowds arrive to get a table at this place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J A.,"Pretty great spot, with the reviews to back it up. Wonderful atmosphere and a super spot to chill with great cocktails. The food was good, although did not quite live up to expectations. If its solely amazing Thai food you're after, YMMV -- but an overall winner nonetheless.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mary C.,"I came here for dinner with one friend on a Wednesday night, and as expected, there was an hour long wait. If you tell yourself it's worth it, then it almost makes the hour go by faster.
Anyways, when you finally get the menu in front of you, you'll be faced with only a small set of options. Makes ordering easy. Almost everyone around me had an order of Pad Thai and Khao Soi, so my friend and I decided this was probably the safer bet and followed suit. 
The dishes did not disappoint. Everything was delicious!! The Khao Soi in particular was memorable. It's nice and hearty, making it almost like comfort food. Perfect for cold weather. We also shared a portion of the Mango Sticky Rice. It is extremely filling (you are after all, eating a blob glutinous of rice...) so make sure you share if you're already up to your neck with delicious food.  
I also want to add that service while slow, is extremely accommodating. My friend was vegetarian, and they were more than happy to make modifications to each dish that we ordered.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Renee B.,The best Thai food I've ever had. Amazing service. Reasonably priced and extremely flavorful food!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,N R.,"I'm from San Francisco, but spent a year living in Bangkok, and have traveled all around Thailand. I can safely say this is one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to. I make business trips to Toronto and come here every time, multiple times. I order half the menu each time. The food is phenomenal, and true to Thai style. Added bonus, they have done a decent job making the interior actually feel like northern Thailand/Chiangmai/Pai. If you're in Toronto, don't hesitate, come here immediately.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ben C.,Really enjoyed this place on a recent visit. The fried fish was surprisingly tasty. Khao soi was delicious. Sangria added a nice touch to this lunch. Hear it gets pretty slammed for dinner so lunch might be better.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina G.,Come here few times now and this place hasn't disappointed me. Pretty loud in there tho. Good quality food standard pricing. Which I like. Atmosphere is casual and market like. Would come here again.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lily H.,Food is good but a little bit pricy for the food. Super busy even at Tuesday night. Go before 5:30 and u will have chance to get a seat.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Justine C.,"I've been getting take out from Pai since I'm not a fan of their loud and chaotic atmosphere, which has worked out quite well. Their green curry is DELICIOUS. Their Khao Soi is still delicious. Their Pad Thai is, unfortunately, underwhelming. Expensive (minimum $15) but worth it if you order the right stuff.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,m m.,"Ordered take out from here a few days ago - the Golden Curry. Magical. This is our new go to Thai spot; surprised we didn't stumble on it sooner. Big ups to the pad Thai and salads as well. In a sea of options serving noodles in sweet ketchup and frozen spring rolls, Pai is truly glorious!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Farheen L.,"2 years ago, in Eat, Pray, Love style - I decided to leave Toronto and move to Thailand. The best part about living there was the food! I know it may not be PC but I love the Thai food in Toronto more than Thailand (feel free to judge me). 
Pai is hands down the best Thai food I've ever had (for a  really long time Sukho was tops for me but I think Pai beats Sukho.)
If you have out of town friends - this is the place to take them!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tk C.,"Great authenic thai food, variety of options. Greta place to expect waiting times, book early.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex T.,"Sort of disappointed given the amount of time I had to wait for the food.  Went in with group and heard good things.  The sat us down and handed the at times confusing menu (since it didn't really describe the dish, just the name with what on it.  Maybe nice to have a photo or list of ingredients without having to ask one of the waiters running around?).  Ordered the pad thai and it took our group about 40 minutes to receive the dishes.  The portion size isn't that large (at lunch at least), and it felt sort of dry, even though the flavours felt there.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Xirui H.,I really want to give this place a five star because the food is just sooo good but I'm unsatisfied with the service.  But I'll definitely come back for the food,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Indu R.,Slow service. Very crowded and long lines to be seated. Food was yummy. Panang fish was delicious. Chicken satay and Gabong were tasty as well.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren C.,"I never write a review... ever! However, I felt like I had to write one after tonight's experience. It wasn't my first time at Pai and the 30min wait (at 8.00pm) to get a table did not come as a surprise. For those who haven't eaten here, there is a reason why people are ready to wait... The food is that good! Yet tonight was unusual, there were a few hiccups with our order. The food was subpar and ingredients were missing. Since we were seated at the bar, the bartenders were taking care of us... if the food usually gets the big rave, well this post is all about the service! The bartenders were very accommodating and did everything to make sure we'd come back.  Trust me, we will. In fact, we're already planning to try out their new restaurant, kiin!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James S.,"Not much to add but finally a place where it isn't over hyped by Yelpers. 
The food and service is great.
I had to get reserve a table a couple weeks ahead.
4.5 Stars but rounding down.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,B K.,"Very popular restaurant for great reasons  - delicious food, good service and location.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah E.,"Pai's food and service is consistently good. Even when it's jam packed the food always arrives quickly and you never feel that the table is unattended. I recommend the garlic shrimp for an appetizer, everytime I go it's always been a crowd pleaser",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wes S.,Food is always full of flavour and portions are generous. Service is fast and lacks nothing. Will come back.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ambika S.,"Visited Pai on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. For starters, my friend and I ordered Miang Kung and spring rolls. The spring rolls were nothing special but Miang Kung was unlike anything I had before. The taste grew on me. 
For main, we ordered Khao Soi and Pad Gra Prow..both vegetarian. They were delicious!
This was my second time visiting Pai and would definitely visit again and recommend to friends.
The servers were really pleasant as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ltn L.,"Food is great, I can feel the different types of curry, I really enjoyed their coconut curry and their pad Thai. However, the soup was way too sugary and way below average standards.
Another problem is if you sit in the concealed corner with a lot of candles, it makes it a hard environment to breathe.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Millie W.,"Besides Salad King, Pai has been a go to place for me whenever I go out. I went here on Saturday for lunch. Ordered the green curry as usual. Had the Thai Ice Tea which I found to be a bit on the sweeter side. The curry was in a coconut which adds to the uniqueness. Although I was lacking in appetite from the previous night, it was a good curry. I would go back to it again to try out the pad thai.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patrick L.,Great food and atmosphere! I ordered chicken green curry which was served in a coconut.  Since the coconut was a little small they served more of the meal in a bowl.  I would come back again,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,F J.,"Food was excellent! We ordered papaya salad, fried fish with tamarind sauce and chili sauce, both sauces are delicious. Also had the Panang shrimp curry. All the dishes are so good. We  enjoyed our dinner. Highly recommended!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Frank N.,Fine restaurant.  Deco is simple but original. The crew is friendly and helpful.  Food is tasty and the prices are more than correct.  Their room called Pai market where you can have a coffee waiting for your pickup order is cute as a button.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kingsley O.,I had the best chicken wings ever here. The food is great but the wait can be a pain in the butt. But it's totally worth trying.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Liam H.,The best Thai food I've had in Canada at reasonable prices. Clearly their mortal and pestle gets heavy usage. The flavours are so vibrant and separate theme from other Thai restaurants. The service both times I've visited was a bit unpleasant and bossy though,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shelley M.,Very quaint restaurant with subdued lighting friendly staff & excellent food.  The Pad Thai is very good as are the chef specials at a very reasonable price.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leesa C.,"First time we arrived, the wait was 40 minutes so we came back another day and the wait was only 5 minutes. I suggest to make a reservation online on their website but they do not accept same day reservations. They also have the option of takeout as well. After seeing all the Yelp reviews, I decided to try it while in Toronto. We tried the fried buttersquash appetizer that we were told was popular. It was quite filling and we were not able to finish it. It came with a dipping sauce that was sweet and it was very tasty. The main dishes we got were the khao soi with braised beef and the green curry served in a coconut. The khao soi was a favorite and the best dish. I've been to many Thai restaurants and would say that this dish was new to me and we'll worth it. However the green curry in a coconut wasn't anything special but the idea of serving it in a coconut was neat. You could carve the coconut meat and eat it with the curry inside.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie L.,"We were there a little bit before it got busy, so we didn't wait too long. Nice atmosphere and amazing food! Will be back to try other dishes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hyoju J.,"One of my favorite restaurants in downtown Toronto. Whenever I went there, there are hue line up so I have to wait almost an hour. I highly recommend to avoid busy hours.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lulu F.,This place is always busy but you can book a reservation to avoid / minimize wait times. I think the Thai food is good but a little overpriced being its downtown and attracting an office / hipster crowd. Lots of celebrity photos on the wall and the service is quick and efficient. My go to typical is their Pad Thai ($14-16) and Thai iced tea ($5). Their Khao Soi with brisket is tender and flavorful ($15-18) as well.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ty T.,"This is a hidden gem for Thai food in Toronto. We went there for late lunch, got there around 2:30ish and the place was packed. We were able to find a table and the food was fantastic. I'd definitely go here very often if I live or work nearby.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eunice C.,"It's authentic and the interior is pretty cool. It's a half basement and the food is cooked slightly different than other Thai places. I did notice that they use a lot of MSG (I am very sensitive to it) so I couldn't digest the food well but the funnier thing was that it wasn't even seasoned properly. Anyway, it's nice to go try once but I don't think I'll be craving it any time soon.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Charles J.,"Amazing Thai food and spicy actually means spicy! Be prepared to wait. Show up, put your name on the wait list, and grab a drink nearby.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sienna Yi Hsin C.,"This is the BEST Thai food that I've ever eaten in Toronto!!! The taste of the food is exactly the same as the one I tried in Thailand few months ago! I personally love spicy and sour food very much so I love the food they serve here. I love this Thai restaurant and I'll definitely come again ;)  If you are craving for the traditional Thai food, this is the place that you definitely don't want to miss !",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,S S.,"Food was incredible! Not like any other Thai food I've had. I had no clue what to order, but ended up with something new that I loved! Service was extremely friendly and helpful. Although there seemed to be a constant line to wait for a table, it went fast. It was nice they text when your table is ready so that we could walk around a bit. It was a really fun place that played great, old classic rock music. Loved it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,H B.,"I've been here a couple of times with friends (~4-5ppl) and there is always a wait during dinner time. However the food and service is definitely worth it! 
We keep our orders pretty similar each time we visit because we've come to crave exactly these dishes:
-papaya salad (served on a platter with vermicelli, veggies, fried pork rinds, shrimp crackers and of course the salad itself)
-beef salad (beef is always VERY tender)
-tom yum soup (big bowl, amazing flavour, comes with a mini flame to keep it hot)
-beef pad thai (generous portion, not gooey, just the right spice level at Medium)
What I have to commend Pai on is their exceptional service despite the level of patrons, servers are always around/asking how everything is. Bravo and I'll definitely be back soon!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stella X.,"Didn't know there is this super popular place near me, and went for my first time. Waiting around 40mins, ordered those transitional Thai dishes. Have to say worth the waiting time, every one of them is tasty!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katie C.,"I've been to Pai's sister restaurants previously, which were Sukothai & Sabi Sabi. I don't think I was ever let down by their consistency.  Their decor is a little different from Sabi Sabi and Sukothai -- which was more authentic feel of Thailand. Their menu is a bit similar , but certain things were added and opted out from the other menus. Of course, I had to begin my dinner with Thai Ice Tea, its something so addictive about it that I can't explain. Next, I have the Thai Sausage for $14 shared among 3 people (so good, its a must try)- I've ordered Gaeng Kiaw Wan (in a coconut)  as my main, which was a green curry and added Farang Spicy for my selection. Though I should have opted out the medium spice instead, it was still very delicious. The fact you can taste the coconut flavour, without being thick or over powering -- I really couldn't finish everything and I was full at the end 
The wait is long -- I went on a Friday , left my name, went for a walk , came back and sat at their waiting area ---it was about a 50 minute wait in total. 
Sometimes, they want their turnover to happen so fast that they would come to our table a bit too often to check on us and though we haven't touch our app for a bit, they wanted to remove it--which I found a  bit overwhelming. I know it's a business, but they shouldn't rush their guests when their trying to enjoy a night out.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin J.,"Stopped in for some chicken Pad Thai and a Singha.
Food was very good and the beer cold.
The medium spice was perfect for me.
Very loud room so don't come for quiet conversation.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Channing F.,"imho, when comparing upper-end thai restaurants in toronto, the differences are more like quibbles than enormous chasms. it's not bad vs. good, just very good vs. great. imho, pai is the better than ksr. it's not light-years ahead, but it's better nonetheless. the food is tastier and it's less pretentious. 
the chicken wings are incredible. the soups and curries are almost perfect. perhaps they could be a touch hotter (temperature, not spiciness). 
the cost is reasonable.
the décor doesn't exactly scream thai, but i don't care. the food blinds me to everything around me.
unfortunately, the service has suffered in the last few months.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Deanna B.,"This is my fav Thai spot in Toronto easily. 
My top reccos at Pai are as follows: 
Miang Kung - very refreshing, generous appetizer - shrimp in betel leaves - must try!
Green Curry - comes in a young coconut
Khao Soi - I love it with the braised beef - big chucks of beef
Overall - very generous portions and great flavour profiles.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark T.,"This place is amazing, not only is the atmosphere great but the staff is also top notch. This is some of the best Thai I have ever had. They also have 1 liter Sapporo which is just a bonus. Highly recommend this place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jodaye R.,"After hearing rave reviews about Pai, I was excited to be in the area a couple of weeks ago, and had the opportunity to try the food.
When I arrived the restaurant wasn't too full and we were able to place our orders quite quickly. The thai iced tea was perfect. My friend ordered the pad thai and I wish I had ordered the same.
I ordered the Khao Soi, and I was not impressed.  The curry did not taste fully cooked, the sauce was very salty and unappealing. Additionally when I left the restaurant I had only what could be described a a case of mild food poisoning. 
Would I eat at pai again? Maybe. But I would stick to the pad thai and the iced tea.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sean R.,"Came here (finally) after some months of curiosity about its claims to being 'authentic' Thai food, whatever that means. So, two stars for friendly and prompt service. Might have given another star had the bartender reacted with any concern when I made it clear that I wasn't impressed. Essentially she looked at me with a bit of a shrug and what came across as, yeah I know, sorry. That was it.
Anyway, food gets zero stars for authenticity unless authentic is a Western hotel chain restaurant in Bangkok. Oh yeah, and the ingredients are substituted for cheaper, less authentic items.
1. pad gra prao - here is my main gripe; I asked for Thai spicy and it wasn't even close. I make spicier food at home for people who don't like spice. Second of all, they used Thai basil, not Holy Basil, as written clearly on the menu. It's a different plant, and a completely different flavour Profile! This entree is DEFINED BY the holy Basil in it, so what gives? 
I get it, it's harder to find and more expensive, but at $13.50 a plate either don't list it in the menu or make the effort to ensure you have the product.
2. Chicken wings were well cooked but had no interesting spice or flavour, and the tamarind sauce was inedible. Finally, the fried shallots were too thick, and either store bought or someone needs to teach the chefs how to make them properly. 
So, go if you want something safe to eat, avoid at all costs if you want any resemblance of authentic, or if you dislike when a restaurant misleads you about the product they offer.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Luis R.,"Was there this summer and really enjoyed their food. Their pad Thai is delicious and any other dish I've tried was very good as well. Nice date spot. 
Pro tip... if you aren't drinking alcohol there is an alcohol free zone that is quicker to get a table for.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kimberley E.,Love love love. Everything on the menu is so good. The curries are flavourful and kao soi is good (but a little too rich for me). Pad Thai is my go to! Service is friendly. My favourite Thai spot in the city!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bruno C.,"I have only seen this level of food in Asia. And I mean everything, from theie own Sangria, to amazing appetizers, phenomenal maisn and unforgettable deserts. This is no fast food price but the value for the experience is definitely worth it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Arnold Y.,What more can I say than what has already been said?  Food was great. I recommend making a reservation. I was able to skip the long lines and get my table exactly at the time promised.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sadia H.,"This is one of the best Thai restaurants outside of Thailand ever! Their standout dish is the Massaman Curry which is succulent, spicy and everything nice. They have a ridiculous waiting time at night so best to go there for lunch at an off-peak hour (after 2 pm). The decor is tantalizingly quirky and I was transported to a street-side Thai eatery immediately.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Purnima T.,"Had to wait a little for our table but was worth the wait. I was there with a pregnant friend, seeing which they moved very fast and made room for us! 
The have 5 levels of spiciness! We ordered family style so that we got to eat everything. Tried pad thai, green chicken curry, fried fish with curry, spring rolls, beef curry, and mango with sticky rice, some fried vegetable (i forget the name). Especially loved the way they served curry in a green coconut! Also their mango juice is made from real mangoes. Everything was nothing but yummy.  
I personally like places that place whole bottle of water on your table. This one does. 
They have their one year anniversary this weekend, wish I was there for that. If you are in Toronto, please go for the anniversary celebration. they are giving free massages and what not!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anchalee S.,"My absolute top pick for Thai food in Toronto. The atmosphere and decor reminds me of a bustling Thai food market, and the food is superb and very authentic Northern Thai cuisine (Thai girl here). It's always busy and I try to make a reservation online if I know a week in advance, or get there early (5ish) if going the same day, otherwise it's a 30-60 minute wait... still worth it though (go around the corner to underground El Caballito for a yummy pitcher of margarita to pass the time). My favourites are: Plah Nua (Beef Salad), Pak Boong Fai Deng (Morning Glory) and pork Pad Gra Prow.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jasmine S.,"Decided to come here with a friends recommendation for a yummy Thai restaurant. I had to wait past the busy dinner time (9pm) to be able to talk to someone on the phone (otherwise it's a voicemail) to make a reservation. 
My friend and I were there first and were served water and we were able to order drinks (Thai Iced Tea, really good) while we waited for the rest of the party to come. By this time it was just starting to get busy with the dinner rush, but it never got ridiculously loud that we weren't able to talk comfortably. When the rest came, drinks were ordered and my friend who does not like drinking sugary drinks was able to order a mango shake no sugar. 
We were never rushed to order but our waitress came in to check on us and make sure our water was full. I ordered the Khao Soi, the others ordered: Pork belly Gaeng Hunglay, and the others ordered the Pad Thai. I found my dish quite heavy to say, I am more used to eating curry with rice so eating noodles got a bit messy. Would I order this again? Yes, but maybe switch for rice. My friends enjoyed their dish and it was all very yummy.
We stayed a bit longer then usual, but they never seemed bothered or annoyed that we were staying after paying for the bill. In fact, they made sure we had water refilled. I love when restaurants don't feel the need to kick customers out, we were catching up and were having a great time.
Overall, great customer service & great food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,An N.,The lychee juice was really yummy and the mango rice was so yummy too.the fries (squash) were pretty good.  (This is my six year old's review),4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacky N.,"We were there Saturday night,  around 7:00. Once we are there,  30 people outside waiting in line. We waited approximately a hour and 15 minutes and it was worth it. Thai tea was excellent,  not too sweet and very refreshing. Khao Soi with braised beef was excellent. The atmosphere of the restaurant was great.  I will definitely coming back next time I am in town.  Best authentic Thai food I ever had.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,KC I.,"The food is beyond amazing, the service is pretty meh (though it obviously is a very busy restaurant!). I'll keep coming back for the food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Siddharth A.,"Amazing food, great vibe and great service. More than value for money. For its price point, this deserves a 5 star rating.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bianca O.,Really nice Thai restaurant. Please make sure you call in advance because it is reaaally busy. Affordable and tasty dishes.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mon Z.,"Thai is one of my favourite cuisine and Pai has become one of my favourite restaurants as well. I have been here for dinner and have ordered lunch from them a couple of times. 
I love their curry dishes the most. I ordered chicken and beef before and have been very happy with my choices.  I also tried their pad thai and although it was good, I cannot say that it was out of the ordinary from other places so I would go back to their curry choices.  
My only complaints is the service, be it at the restaurant or delivery. Although they are friendly, service is quite slow. One time they missed a dish when my office ordered from them.  Their lunch menu  is also much more limited than their dinner menu.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen M.,After seeing the reviews I had to try this place. I can without a doubt say this is the best Thai I have ever had! Big statement considering I have even lived in Thailand for a few months. Also best service I have came across at a Thai restaurant (not something thai places are known for) I came here my second last night in Toronto and came back again my last night both nights at peak dinner time the line moves fast and is worth every second of wait.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle L.,"Awesome place, gets pretty packed easily, but the place is pretty big. There are more rooms in the back. I like the ambience and the food :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sadia K.,"We went on a weekday and there was a 45 minute wait. Boy was the wait worth it. I love the story this place had to tell. Small town thai folks open a restaurant in Toronto. Not your usual red curry, pad thai place. They have a unique menu. I had a soup with crispy noodles served on the side. We tried their chicken satay, green curry. I wish I remembered the dishes as they were quite amazing. It really offers a unique menu and a unique dialogue. I have to go back again and update my review.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Penelope C.,Delicious! Everything was so good! The lines are crazy and it's not the most fanciest looking restaurant but I'm okay with that. Def worth the visit. I keep thinking about it after.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cheryl L.,"One of my favourite Thai restaurants in the city! Prices are fair. Unlike other people have mentioned, every time I have been here, I haven't had to wait that long. I would definitely recommend the grabong, pad thai, khao soi and gaeng masaman!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yanjun W.,"The food was good. But I have to say the food serving was tooooo SLOW!! 15 minutes waiting to be seated+ Sitting there for 40 minutes waiting for just 1 order. When I complained, the boss even didn't say sorry for the waiting or something else. Will never go back again waiting that long for a super slow serving and bad attitude.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sanj P.,"We went there last night and had the worst experience ever. As usual there was a wait time of 15 min and we said we would be ok with the spot at the bar table if it came up earlier. We got a table at the bar after about I think 10 min and while we were sitting down at the bar chair, something poked my friend at the inner thigh .. the chair looked clean and there wasn't anything we could find but she was in so much pain that she had to go to the bathroom to check it out.. she came in 2 min saying there is something pierced inside and she isn't able to remove it and is hurting. I went back in with her and found a piece of sharp wood almost like a 1 inch needle poked inside her back of the thigh. I realized that was from the chair. We went back in and showed it to the guys upfront and they said they could change our seats if we want but we will have to wait. We asked for a bandaid and they got it for us.. they did not apologize or were really sorry for what had happened. I saw them offer those same seats to someone without even checking the chair!! I was beyond shocked. Their food could be good and so is good at other Thai places in the city like khao San road , I was disappointed with the way this was handled. Not going back here ever again!",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mo O.,"Apart from the long wait for food, the food was delicious! We got the pad gra prow and the chef unit pad thai and they were generous portions and really tasty.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica C.,"This is the best Thai place that I have EVER gone to. I would say, in comparison to Khao San Road, this is by far better. 
At Pai, the Tom Yum Soup is my favourite. Presentation is good as it comes with a burner and pot on top with a side of rice. You are able to pick the spicy level and the second level of spiciness is already super spicy. So for those that can't handle spicy, please just order no spice. The pineapple alcohol drink is also pretty refreshing as it is served in a whole pineapple. Pretty neat! 
It is bit of a wait to get a table...so I would recommend going off hours or going there a bit earlier as it would be approximately a 45min wait. 
The servers were great and atmosphere is super chill!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tyler L.,"Hits all the right notes. The flavours were complete, the dishes cooked just right - taken off the stove at exactly the right moment. I've not frequented the other restaurants in this vein, but do have a taste for Thai food and this I enjoyed.
The decor is quiet nice, and feels like there is room to breathe in this area. The ""bar"" space (Bebop?) feels a little wasted though. 
Standout dish was the deep fried squash... but of course the mango sticky rice was excellent also.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Saba A.,"I had an amazing experience in Pai! We ended up sitting at the bar because the place was packed ( make sure you reserve one day in advance) which I didn't mind! The service was excellent and the vibe was great! The place is nicely decorated and the layout was warm! I ordered the green curry, it was served in a coconut and tasted great! Pai is for sure my new go to place",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nikita T.,"This was truly the highlight of my Toronto trip. Having been to Thailand, I can honestly say that this has been one of the best places I've been to outside of Thailand. I am Gluten intolerant and I had no issues ordering from this place as most items are Gluten free. I had the Pad thai, Green curry, and chicken satay and each dish was 5 stars. I give this place an overall 4 though because I wish they had a bigger menu like other thai restaurants. However, do not let this keep you from trying this spot!! Its amazing!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christian B.,Best Thai food I've ever had. No competition. So many amazing flavors and well developed dishes. A must try if you're in Toronto!!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fatema R.,Thai food here was amazing! We ordered a curry and the shrimp appetizer. Both were well made. The portion for the curry was large enough for us to share with 2 bowls of rice. Service was fast and restaurant was very clean.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Meg C.,"Loved the environment at Pai. The signage outside made me wonder if this was more of an upscale place than I was expecting. Inside, I loved the atmosphere and decor. There was a section with floor pillows to sit on, which I imagine was for bigger groups. I decided on having the Jasmine Rice that was fried with an egg, onions and garlic. Lots of Garlic! It was delicious, and the portion size was gigantic. My boyfriend had the Pad Thai and the portion was pretty big too.
The service was good, but our waitress didn't seem very enthusiastic about anything, so that could definitely be better.
Overall, would I go back? Yes. But only if I was in that area and really craved the rice.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jon D.,Pretty solid.  I wish there were more dishes that I liked.  There Khao Soi is really good.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel D.,"My go-to Thai place in the city. Pai offers the best balance of everything you'd hope for in a good Thai restaurant. The atmosphere is lively, the décor is nice, the food is excellent and the service is consistent. Beef Khao Soi, spring rolls, garlic shrimp, signature pad thai and oxtail are definite must-tries. The worst part is waiting in line.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jack T.,"So so. The food was looking better in my mind then it was on my plate. I didn't really have any items that were worth mentioning to my friends. and the atmosphere is really important to me, you know, the lighting the music and smells etc, However, I found the noises too loud, the chattering of tables around me and the aromas of fish when I was there for some reason mixed with a mustiness. But the servers were okay and the price point was also reasonable.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica W.,"I don't get the hype. Atmosphere was really nice, cool mix of Thai and rock and roll in a cozy environment. The food was just not that great. Had the Thai iced tea - meh. The pad thai was way too dry and I also had the khao soi (egg noodles in a yellow curry-like soup/paste) - the soup was literally a thick creamy sauce. Not appetizing. We both finished a quarter of our plate before giving up. Service was also unfriendly in our case.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bella I.,"After recently visiting the city of Pai in Northern Thailand, I was ready for the disappointment of poser thai restaurants in Toronto. I saw Pai on Urban Spoon as one of the top 10 hottest restaurants in Toronto at the moment, so thought i'd check it out with some family. The atmosphere once you walk in is just like Pai, super hippy vibes with friendly staff, warm lighting and reggae tunes. We had a round of Chang beer then started with the spring rolls and Papaya Salad. The salad was so fresh and yummy! It came with glass noodles, pork rinds and another crunchy delight on the side. For mains we ordered the chicken fried rice, the pad thai, the massamam beef curry and I had the green curry (mak mak spicy). They were all too good, just like back in Thailand. The dessert was a yummy sticky rice with egg custard. WE LOVE PAI!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jiafei L.,This place sucks. I've never had such horrible food ever in my life. Thanks for nothing. Jk I lied,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brandy C.,"Save some time, make reservation online!  Very traditional Thai food restaurant with cool interior design!  The fried rice was delicious!  Pick crispy pork!!! And it matches with their green curry!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leanne H.,"Really good thai place in the downtown area! I loved the coconut curry chicken and it's such a unique dish! I feel like this is something I can only find a this restaurant and makes the trip worthwhile. I also like the island vibe décor - really feels like you're on vacation :) Prices might be a tad high for thai food, but honestly, for the downtown area, it is quite reasonable. Overall, this is definitely a place I would recommend to friends and family! Only downside is that this place can get quite loud and may be hard to hear conversations at the same table.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,K S.,"I took my parents here for a lunch on my Mother's birthday. It was fairly busy, since it was a Saturday, but we were seated promptly. 
Both the service and food was definitely better than our expectations, which have been lowered since there are so many mediocre Thai places popping up around Downtown Toronto. 
My parents, vegetarians who have small appetites and conventional palate, ordered the Vegetarian Pad Thai, while I had the Crispy Basa Fillet with jasmine rice and Thai iced-tea. We were all very pleased with the food and enjoyed it fully, even my father who tends to not like Pad Thai easily.
The pad Thai was well seasoned and the flavours were balanced, creating a cohesive sweet, tangy, and nutty flavour that was delicious. The fish was beyond fluffy, with a perfectly crispy and seasoned batter, it was cooked to the exactly right temperature, for it to remain moist while still staying light despite the fact that is was deep fried. The Thai iced-tea was also delicious, and much closer to what I'm told is how it was originally served in Thailand (despite still have artificial colouring in it). It wasn't overly sweet like some places, and has a distinct almost nutty tea flavour that I could not get enough of. 
Overall, I would highly recommend this place. While it's not the most authentic (it does after all cater to the typical western tastes) it is now fairly high in my top 10 Thai places to go to in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vanessa M.,Since coming back from being in Thailand for two months and doing a cooking course there nothing has been as good in Toronto. Then I found pai- it is the only truly authentic Thai food I've had- the papaya salad is so great it brings me back!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leanette T.,"The wait time was about 15 minutes on an early Sat evening. It does have a busy, yet cozy atmosphere. But I still felt comfortable, considering I prefer a more quiet and low key setting. I liked the vibe, good music and visually stimulating. 
We ordered pai thai chicken. It was the most delicious pai thai I've ever eaten. Very moist, the right amount of sauce. decent serving, and very flavorful. I enjoyed every bite. All the hype is well deserved.
The only thing i didn't feel comfortable with was being seated close to the bathrooms. No restaurant should do this, bathrooms should be away from where people have to eat. And they need to work on keeping up with cleanliness of bathroom(womens). There was paper overflowing waste baskets and it was not pleasant smelling in there. A clean bathroom is the icing on the cake for me when dining out and here was lacking which is why I took away a point.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Glor N.,"I came here for dinner a little while ago, there was about a half hour wait...less than at Khao San Road. The food was definitely worth it! I had a golden curry and it was really good. Service was decent. Will be back. :)
Edit: I've probably been here another 10 times since, it's definitely my favourite Thai place in the downtown core! Green curry is cute, served in a coconut and very flavourful. Pad thai is excellent. Thai tea tastes exactly what it should taste like.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle T.,"The food is definitely worth the wait!! We arrived on a Sunday evening at 6pm. By 6:30 the lineup was up the stairs and almost out the door!
I started with the Thai Iced Tea!! The drink was really strong and concentrated, which is great because there was tons of ice to balance it out. A great start! Was really sweet as well, so I guess it depends if you love sweet drinks or not.. 
As an app we had the squash fries.. im not sure what they were actually called as my friend ordered it but they were squash fries and it was amazing!!! I could probably just have that dish for dinner. It was huge!!
For my main I had the chicken pad Thai! Of course I had to try the pad Thai! It was amazing!!! The portion wasn't very big but every bite of it was absolutely delicious! It was savoury, sweet, a bit sour and you even get to choose the level of spiciness! What wasn't to love about it?!? I would say it is a must try here!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cecilyn B.,"Loved it!!! I had the egg rolls and fried rice, and they were AMAZING!!!!! My friends got chicken pad thai and a beef dish.... any way... doesn't matter... all very delicious!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James M.,"The problem was with our server. She never once checked on us, a man who may have been the owner did once. We finished our food and ordered mango sticky rice with the man who wasn't even our server. No less than 25 minutes passed before we flagged down the man again to check on our dessert. He said there was a mix up in the kitchen but that he would get them right out, which he did. An hour and 45 minutes after sitting we were able to enjoy our dessert. Lucky for us, our ""server"" was taking an order from a nearby table and we were able to get our check and get out of there.
Maybe it was an off night, but that server ruined what could have been a great meal.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brian L.,"This review is intended for its new ""curry of the day"" in the extended space, NOT its main restaurant session. I have been to the restaurant for lunch dozens of times and also regularly take out its $10 curry of the day. Recently they opened a new space for that during lunch time which is a good opportunity. After trying its green curry, which I am so familiar with, I was very disappointed with the poor food quality: pink coloured dark meat, watery source and 2/3 of usual volume. It is disappointing to see that PAi cut corners to reduce cost when expanding. I do hope that they will improve the offering and give us the same quality soon.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bruno G.,"Been going a couple of times there and happy to give Pai a good review. 
First of; make sure to reserve or arrive early; the place gets packed pretty quick. 
The food is always delicious. My favorite dishes are the Khao Soi, the spring rolls ans skewers. The dishes usually come quite fast and well made. 
The staff are very friendly, polite and they know their menu well. They always take the time to present the dishes when they deliver them to you. 
They have a section where you sit on cushions, it brings a nice experience. 
The prices are really competitive for downtown core.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Janet K.,"1. Grabong ($10): Deep fried battered squash fritters with a garlic tamarind dip
- I really like this as an appetizer. The tangy dip complements the sweet squash well.
2. Gaeng Kiaw Wan in a coconut ($15): Green curry with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, green peppers and coconut milk. Served in a coconut with rice. Choice of: chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, fish, tofu or veggies.
- Lots of meat in the curry. Good for sharing.
3. Khao Pla Tawt ($14): Crispy basa fillet with oyster sauce, crispy shallots served with 2 sauces: fresh chilli sauce and tangy tamarind sauce
- I loved this because the fish was crispy the entire time and it wasn't greasy.
4. Khao Soi with beef ($14): Fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander and green onions. Choice of braised beef, chicken breast or chicken drumsticks
- Consistently good dish from Chef Nuit. The golden curry is flavourful and rich but not heavy. Braised beef was tender. 
5. Papaya salad - salted crab ($10): Shredded green papaya, tomato, long green beans, garlic, red chilli, tamarind juice, fish sauce, coconut sugar and freshly squeezed lime
- The salted crab tasted like sashimi and though the claws were small, they were very salted which balanced out the rest of the salad. 
6. I Moo Ping ($10): Northern Thai Street Grilled Pork on a skewer
- 3 skewers",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura A.,"The best Thai I have EVeR had, and I live near New York City and have had good thai food. The dishes had excellent presentation and tasted like they  were made with love. Even the Thai iced tea had crunchy shaved ice and surprisingly made it more enjoyable. There were little details in the food presentation that made it taste gourmet. Loved the pad Thai and the dish with the crispy noodles. Yum. I wish I could go again right now.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samer N.,"Pai may be the best Thai restaurant in the city. I come frequently for lunch and the only complaint would be that the lunch menu is a little bit more limited than dinner. However, everything on the menu is great. The Khao Soi and the Green Curry are my personal two favorites for lunch. The Pad Thai is also spectacular and you can't go wrong with most of their appetizers. They also have a pretty interesting and unique cocktail list and the atmosphere in the restaurant is very lively and fun.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara F.,"Woot woot!   Who loves amazing Thai food?   This lady.  
Pai is the best Thai in the city.  Granted, Toronto has pretty subpar Thai options so one often settles within the ""you get what you get"" scenario.    Regardless, PAI deserves every accolade and praise it receives.  
Former Chef of Khao San Road opened this place approx 1.5 yrs ago and it offers all the yumminess without any of the attitudes.  Examples, you can actually make a reservation, you can be seated if not all of your party is there yet, servers aren't striving to get points on each other by prove how nasty they can be (sorry, that is my anti KSR bias showing). 
The food is amazing.  I love spicy food and this place delivers if you ask for spicy.
Things I particularly love; it is a perfect spot for veggies and omnivores alike (not sure about vegans), the atmosphere almost feels like you are coming home.   
I am a creature of habit and continue to love their red Thai curry.  Delicious, delicious, delicious",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brianna S.,"This is honestly the best Thai food I've ever had. My only regret is that I didn't find this place sooner. I just can't get enough of it! Getting a reservation is tricky, but they're on UberEATS, take advantage of that.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cheska S.,"One of my faaaavourite thai restos in the dot. Minus the lonnger than average wait for a table/food, the food is well worth the wait. Must try the papaya salad! Super flavourful and crunchy (if you like that texture). Any dish you order that has meat with it is bound to be tender and they give you hearty servings of it as well! Coconut green curry is served in an actual coconut, which is soo cool (yes, you CAN and SHOULD eat the coconut afterwards). & if you still have room for dessert, I recommend the mango sticky rice; the mangoes are ripe and sweet, while the rice is thick and warm.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clea S.,"So so so good! So happy I happened on this place on yelp. Really authentic Thai food and great atmosphere. Would eat there every night of my business trip if I could. I had the Thai basil chicken can't remember the exact name but holy cow, two thumbs up! Highly recommended! And reasonably priced!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ryan R.,"This place is delicious! Fast, FREINDLY service and amazing flavours make for the perfect downtown lunch or dinner. Pad Thai, Khao Soi, GREEN CURRY to live for.. Definitiely try it out!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,C S.,"Disappointing as I read great reviews for this place. Waited over 40 mins for food when people around us finished their apps and main course and a pitch of sangria. (We arrived at 5:25pm) Food was typical Thai. Nothing to rave about. Prices are average. Being in the busy entertainment district, I would expect more efficient service. Unfortunately we won't be back.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shinjini S.,"I've eaten here a few times now and I love the place. Anytime I am craving Thai food - this place is my go-to. The flavours are authentic! I love that you can also alter the spice according to your taste buds - get farang if you're looking for some real kick. The highest level is just waaaay too spicy in my opinion. The staff are also knowledgable about how their food is made, which makes it easy to order if you have restrictions or allergies. Highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tatiana D.,My favourite Thai place in town for eating in! Pai has a great vibe with very fast and efficient service. As a Caesar lover I definitely recommend Tom Yum Caesar as it's the perfect combination of flavours! Their non-alcoholic drinks are not as good though. Tom Yum soup itself has a great presentation but the taste is different from original Tom Yum we are al used to. My date who ordered it didn't like it while I truly enjoyed the uniqueness of the flavours. My favourite dish is Khao Soi. It has a lot of sweet curry coconut sauce and crispy noodles on top. Highly recommended!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sophie H.,Sweeeeeeet!!!! Every dish on the menu has added sugar! With every bite I thought I was eating a cup of sugar with maple syrup on top. Not for me - I'm already sweet enough!,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cassia F.,Good atmosphere. Almost always very busy. Food is great but a little bit too salty for my taste.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marie L.,"What's the Hype?!  Pai is the hype! My new favorite place...... I checked this restaurant out...and I think I found my new love. My friends, everything was so good I wanted to pitch a tent in front of the place. Truly good, I swear. My complements to Chef Nuit, u R the best!
Sorry for the overly positive response but I feel you just have to be that way sometimes cause bad responses are the norm it seems. Those out there that are good, my hat is off to you. I love you all.
Thanks for wonderful times and great meals
Oh, to those that couldn't wait in the line - to bad. For the rest of you that braved it with me.. loves is in the air. We ate very well!
Oh, love the decor,,, this place is slightly in a basement? not a cave, not closed off, not secluded , hmm maybe secluded a bit but in the best way possible. Its a bit of Thailand in Toronto and that i can handle just fine.
Jeff and Nuit, love you both but i love your food more.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason L.,"Everything about this place is awesome. Atmosphere, food, music, free wifi, friendly service. Don't pass this place up if you have the chance to visit Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rana S.,"Best Thai food I've ever had.. Such an amazing environment to be in as well. The restaurant is very unique... staff is very bubbly and positive.  Would definitely go back! Very Pleased! Also, very friendly management and owner!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa R.,"this place is so crazy busy popular, but it's worth the wait. I like that they text you when your table is ready. The thai-inspired sangria was really tasty and I plan on recreating it so I can enjoy it at home. The food did not disappoint. Would recommend.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy J.,"Best pad Thai in town.   Huge restaurant with tons of seating.  Delicious spring rolls, amazing Tom yum soup.  You have got to eat here!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kassandra T.,"The atmosphere was very lively, and workers were very friendly. Pretty good food overall, but our tom yum came out too cold. Pad thai was delicious!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ann C.,"I've had Pai's food quite a number of times (in person, delivery, and takeout), and have always been happy with the taste and quality of the food. They always have a huge lineup, so be prepared for a pretty lengthy wait for your food!
My favourites are the Pad Gra Prow with minced beef, and the fried rice. The fritters, spring rolls, Pad Thai, and Massaman beef curry are also great.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael C.,"This was maybe the best Thai food I've had. Lots of interesting dishes and they were all pretty tasty. The bar and wait staff were all very nice and the drink while waiting for carry out works well if it's too busy to eat there.
Among other things, the variety of dishes with eggs, like the Thai Omelet, are really good and very different from your typical Thai place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,NaNtHi H.,"Finally a really tasty and authentic thai restauraunt  in toronto. We stumbled upon this place about 1 month of being open and we've loved it since.  Last month we were in Thailand and we were craving the street food we had on our trip and so we headed down to Pai and even after having the real deal on the streets of Thailand this is pretty damn good and as authentic as it gets. The pad gra prao is delicious ! Great atmosphere, great service and food. Love Pai",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren W.,"My friend and I have been here multiple times. We keep coming back for the Pad Thai, the Squash Fritters and the Thai Iced Tea! It is the best Pad Thai I've ever had. Hands down. In the words of John Catucci ""You gotta eat here!""",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,A.B M.,"Authentic for sure, here is what I ordered
Khao Sai - Beef- just okay, the noodles were kinda hard, but not in a good way, the beef was TOO rich, not my style. The sauce was salty and you could taste the shrimp.
Pad thai - wonderful! if you're here get it but don't go out of your way for it
Green curry chicken, very authentic - reminded me of the green curry we would eat on the beach in thailand but again most places get this right. 
the lineup to get int was a good 45 minutes, the drinks are expensive. 
I probably won't be going back and if I do i'll stick to the pad thai.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Doris T.,We came to this place around 4pm and found a full room of people eating already. Chicken Pad Thai was excellent - the best we ever had. Basil with minced chicken with rice is also packed with flavor. Highly recommend this place if you are in town.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Greg V.,"Oh my goodness the food here was INCREDIBLE! Very relaxed, fun vibe inside. Great service. The restaurant catered to my food allergies. Will definitely go back! One tip: Definitely make a reservation; we went for an early lunch on a Saturday and the place was already teaming with people!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarena J.,"Best thai food in toronto! Pad thai is delicious and doesn't taste too sweet or tomato like. The tom yum soup is delicious and has a nice spice, i did find the vegetables to be far to large in the soup... no one wants a mouthful of onion but with exception to that it was exceptional.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Iris P.,"One of my favourite thai places always busy so i order delivery instead! Pad Thai with Shrimp, Khao Soi with Chicken, Pad Gra Prow with Pork are my go-to dishes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jess W.,The Moo Grob is the best thing on the menu! sooo yummy. the restaurant atmosphere is great - very casual and fun. One of my favourite restaurants.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lucas S.,"I've been to Pai twice in the last week and will likely go back again this coming week. In TO on business. Without a doubt, this is the best Thai food I've ever had and honestly, it's just some of the best food I've ever had period. The staff are friendly and casual, the service is quick and sassy. I will crave the Pad Gra Pow for the rest of my natural life. The morning glory is incredible and the laap salad is ridiculous. Try the sweet ""tea"" as well!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura C.,Been to this restaurant twice now and both times the food was really good.  The wait time is a bit long cause it's so busy but also takes a little longer to get your food but it's worth the wait. Staff are friendly also.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lucia C.,Authentic. The hype is real. Just try it. A 4 star and not a 5 just because it can feel a little too crowded and had a rushed vibe to it.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael O.,Love this place - eaten lunch here half a dozen times with a friend or two. Food tastes great - favourite is crispy pork!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ameena E.,Loved the place! It's busy always which testifies to their amazing food. Portions are good for the price. Try the butternut squash fritters (pretty big portion) for an appetizer and the mango sticky rice for dessert. It is pretty loud and dark in there but it doesn't hurt the feel of the environment.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael L.,"Friendly friendly friendly. Busy hopping place with a big wait by 7pm on a Thursday night. Spring Rolls, Chicken Satay Skewers and Pad Thai are staples and are so delicious here!! sit at the bar and watch the action. i can see why this place is so packed. we were heading to a show and i wish we had more time to enjoy more dishes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexandra P.,"Awesome place! Great authentic food and a cool environment. Often has a line, so plan ahead. 
Great place to take friends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bridgette F.,"The food was good (snacks and starters). We didn't eat a main dish due to the poor customer service. Atmosphere is great with good music. We were seated at a small cramped 2 seater table, so we asked for a bigger table top. The host was slightly perturbed by our request! And stated that they were expecting a bigger party for the table, although he unwillingly obliged he wanted to know how long we would be staying... really! We noted other patrons being served before us although we arrived first. Furthermore I over heard a waitress arguing with the patrons at the table next to us. poor poor customer service!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Reviewer T.,"Was there for a NY celebration and had a great time! 
Perfect atmosphere, great food at a reasonable price and friendly staff!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cindy H.,"Came back multiple times since initial post, so I've tried basically every item on the menu.
The beef noodle soup and the coconut curry are my favourites in addition to the Pad Gra. Their pad thai is delicious, but not nearly as unique as the other items on their menu.
I also love the expanded drink menu, where I recently ordered their white wine sangria which was made using Reisling, guava, lychee, pineapple, and a few more exotic ingredients. Yum!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hui-Ling M.,"One of the best Thai restaurants I've ever been to. Great service, music, atmosphere, and of course the food is delicious!! I would come to Toronto just for this lol.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Serial Diner D.,"What a great spot! My friend and I had a very pleasant meal here, starting with the Laap salad served with lettuce leaves and sticky rice. It's a ground pork dish - I believe it's the national dish of Laos - with amazing flavours and texture, and just the right amount of spice. A great starter for two people. For my main I had the chicken Pad Thai which I thoroughly enjoyed. The portion was perfect - I even had leftovers to take home. My friend had the Pad Gra Prow, which is stir fried ground beef with basil and oyster sauce, served on jasmine rice and topped with a fried egg. She loved it.
Prices are very reasonable and atmosphere was nice. It's also a good place to take colleagues or clients for lunch. You probably want to make a reservation though as there was a line forming by 6 pm on a Friday. Can't wait to go back!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anu M.,"Definitely THE best Thai food in Toronto. We reserved the day before and the only slot available was 9 pm . This place gets packed.  We loved the spring roll , Khao soi , Thai fried rice and pad Thai . Everything had great flavour .",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin P.,Best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. Seriously so good- every experience has been amazing! Not much to write about other than to go try it out if you haven't already!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sandra T.,"Best Thai food I've ever had and great atmosphere as well. We thought there would be a long line but it was fine, we got in right away.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chrid G.,Great Thai in the middle of Toronto! Didn't wait too long for a table and the food was awesome! Amazing atmosphere and excellent service made it an excellent late night quick bite on our first night in town.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah G.,"This was THE BEST Thai food I've ever had. My group and I were visiting from Texas and found this place on yelp. It has over 1,000 reviews and for good reason! The service is great and the food is better!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Winston C.,"One of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto, even if the green curry at Sabai Sabai is superior",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tracy Z.,"As if this place needs another 5 star review...
The food here is ridiculously good. There is usually a line, so get in early if you can. It's super busy and pretty loud, so if that's not your scene, steer clear of this place. Everything I've tried here is flavourful, delicious, fresh, and a decent portion size. I highly recommend this place for great, authentic Thai food in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ted U.,"Amazing food and a fun atmosphere. Very good recommendation from a local contact and now I'm wishing I had one back home. We sat in the ""newer"" section, and they had awesome 90's rock playing on the patio. Really good service topped by even better food. The Thai hot lives up to its billing...yes, it was truly hot, but it was also was full of amazing flavor. This was a fantastic experience, and I'd call it a must do for anyone visiting the city.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea D.,Worth the wait! We wanted to try this place and booked the first Saturday night reservation that had .. 2 months in advance. After waiting so long we were very excited to finally try what everyone has been talking about and it was definitely worth the wait! I understand why people put their name on the list and wait over an hour for a table. The service was incredible and the food was amazing. The appetizers were delicious especially the squash. The mains were the perfect size. Were ordered 4 mains for 4 people and shared everything- it was more than enough food. The flavors were delicious especially the green curry and basil sauce dish. It is very lively atmosphere we can't wait to go back!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lani L.,"Everything was good. We had the wings and spring rolls for appies. I had the beef masaman and my boyfriend had the pad gra prow, both are top notch. We've been going top those place every week and anything we try is absolutely delicious. Can't recommend it enough.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tiff K.,"One of the few Thai places in Toronto that has Khao Soi and it's absolutely delicious. But be prepared to stand in line during peak lunch/dinner hours. If you order the Khao Soi, get extra noodles on the side because the curry is SO good, you'll want more noodles than it comes with and there's always extra curry! The first time I had the pad Thai, it was good but the following 3 times I ordered it, it got progressively worse (reason why I'm giving 4 stars).",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Teresa W.,Go to Thai food... Always a huge line up but it clears out relatively quickly since they have massive spacing. A little pricey but you get what you pay for : quality Thai food.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lucy G.,Amazing food and great service! I would  recommend the cojo cocktails and pad Thai green curry and satay skewers were also delicious!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victor T.,"Review is only for their Pad Thai.  
Only gotten take-out during lunch.  Small portion for what you pay ($13.50 plus tax during lunch).  Pad Thai is pretty cheap to make so they can at least fill up the take-out container.  It's pretty tasty though and comparable to the other Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto like Khao San Road and Sukho Thai.
Also tried the Moo Grub (crispy pork).  Very crispy indeed and tasty.  Could use some dipping sauce to enhance it.
It's hard to find good Pad Thai in the city hence why I returned to Pai a few times already but I'll admit that it hurts paying $15.00 for it since the cost of ingredients aren't expensive.  It is what it is.  I hate how Thai food is priced and how it's regarded as ""fancy"" but really, it's very similar to Chinese and Vietnamese food.  It should not be this expensive.
P.S. Shoutout to Thai Bistro (now closed) for their Pad Thai.  It was under $13.00 for a Beef Pad Thai WITH Tofu and it filled up the entire take-out container.  That was IMO the best Pad Thai in Toronto.  Hope the owner Jack and his family are doing alright since it closed...",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christina R.,"great thai food, but what made it was the atmosphere all together. The meat (both chicken and pork) were good, but the chicken was more fresh. I enjoyed the pad thai but my friend said there was too much oyster sauce. Beer was a good price! May be back again if craving thai food, if not then it won't be a place i'll bring friends for a random dinner.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Denise O.,"Amazing food! We went to the restaurant at 5:30 on a Sunday and by looking at the front we thought it was maybe closed. As soon as we opened the door, you could feel the energy and hear the sounds of patrons dining. As we walked down the steps into the restaurant, we were filled with excitement! Not only was the food amazing, but it was served fast! Highly recommend it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tay H.,I'm so surprised to see the reviews on this place. We found the food mediocre at best and very expensive for what you get.  Sala Thai on danforth is better.,2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Richard C.,"The food here was incredible. We waited 15 minutes at the bar because the restaurant was jam packed.
Would highly recommend and would come back. I'd love to make this my go to Thai place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bill L.,"Amazing food! They also got one of those shoes off style tables (which would be nice for parties)
Things to get:
-Thai Sausage Platter 
- Thai Iced Tea
- Curry Oxtail
Will be back for more sampling",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike A.,"Everything I had here was delicious. I came with a group and we ordered almost everything on the menu so I was able to try a little bit of everything, which was great.
My second time back, I knew exactly what I liked from before and got to order and eat a larger portion.
The atmosphere is great and very laid back.
Highly recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Icy C.,"So...I went again recently to Pai. This time, it was for dinner.
The service was slower than last time (or because we were just super hungry!), but the food is great as expected.
We went on a week day night at around 7:30pm. We were quickly seated, however our waitress did not attend our table for a while because it was really busy.
The food is excellent. I ordered a green curry chicken that came in a fresh coconut, and the flavour is nice and rich, but the curry is not overpowering, which is nice :D.
Definitely will be back again when the weather gets warmer.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley Y.,"This is by far my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. The restaurant is more spacious than Khao Sao Road and it has a great vibe. My friend and I ordered spring rolls for starters and Thai Iced Tea (basically a Thai version of milk tea) + Coconut Water. The drinks came in large cups and I love the iced tea. The tea was brewed strongly and its sweetness wasn't overpowering. 
I had the Pad Gra Prow with chili fish sauce (prik nam pla) served on the side. The minced pork was stir fried with basil and red peppers, served on top of the rice with a fried egg and some crispy barbecue pork. It was absolutely scrumptious and I had to stop myself from wolfing it down in two minutes! 
My friend's Kao Soi was really delicious as well. She chose the beef option and the thick egg noodles were chewy. If you're into sweet curry, this is the dish for you! The noodles were bathed in a pot of yellow curry with beef and it was super creamy and rich. 
We'll definitely be back again to try out the other dishes. I highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea & Pad Gra Prow!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,para n.,Awesome food just like in Thailand.   But feels like lots of MSG just like in a Thailand.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nancy K.,"Wanted to find a place to eat try their wounder full Thai food as we heard from a friend. Every thing was more than we expected. good food,good service,good environment. We will go back for coming birth day",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Miriam T.,By far one of the best thai restaurants in Toronto! Ive taken many ppl there and they loved it hope theyll be other locations!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Timothy M.,"Some of the best Thai I have ever had.  Portions were perhaps slightly small, but service and food quality were top of the line.  Get a reservation!  I am not from Toronto, so I didn't anticipate how wildly popular this place could be on a Tuesday night in March.  Was still packed when I left at 8:30.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Philip V.,"Just wanted to take a moment to compliment the service we received from Ivy last night! The restaurant was super busy, however, it didn't stop her from taking her time to explain everything about the food and the menu. Will definitely come back and recommend this gem to my friends. Thanks Ivy!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris H.,Some of the best Thai food in Toronto. It's a little pricey for what you're getting but well worth it. I've never have a bad meal in this restaurant.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Barbara L.,Arrive early because its nearly impossible to snatch a table here..and for good reason. The food (although tricky to order if its your first time eating thai) is delicious! One dessert on the menu and its amazing. Trendy little restaurant in a trendy part of Toronto,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sam I.,"Amazing! Best recommendation we received when we traveled to Toronto. Can not recommend this place enough. Our next trip North will be centralized around dinner here. Be prepared for a lengthy, but worthwhile wait if you do not make a reservation. Very affordable meals with average priced cocktails for Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tara L.,"You have to try this place! This place is one of the best Thai restaurant I ever been too.The food is authentic and delicious, the waiters/waitresses are quick and funny. The portion of the food is not big so my friends and I usually order many dishes and share, work perfectly well for a girl night out!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris H.,This place never dissappoints me and my family when we go for a lunch there not expensive either a must if you love Pai food,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Darryl Y.,"The Pad Gra Prao is the dish to get here. Great value, and simply delicious. There's variety available within the dish, with Pork or Beef being the two best options. Add extra crispy pork or shrimp to take this dish to the next level. Thai Iced Tea or Mango Juice complement the meal wonderfully and the service and atmosphere is great. 
The lines here aren't as bad as at Khao San Road, as they've got a considerably larger seating area, and they have the option available for large parties to book out the back room (though you're required to order their prix-fixe menu, which isn't ideal).
As someone who lives in the area I was particularly glad just to have a second option to Khao San Road and the long wait times there, but Pai has actually overtaken Khao San Road in my book as my go-to Thai spot in the entertainment district.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rebecca S.,"This is probably one of my favourite finds. It's a cute, small underground restaurant with a huge personality. This is a very busy place so I suggest you make your reservations well ahead of time. We weren't able to make a reservation so we had to wait about 40 minutes before we got a table but I can tell you it was definitely worth it. I ordered the gaeng masaman with braised beef, it's a very sweet curry but I highly recommend it. I loved it.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Niharika R.,I would definitely be back to try every  dish on their menu . I decided to be safe and tried their pad Thai ( it was great but then I was regretting that I did not try the other dishes ) My husband tried the pad gra prow and my  friend tried the fried fish with green curry . Every ingredient adds to the flavour of the dish .The best part is they let you choose the spice level . They have 5 different spice levels . I decided to go with the farang spicy ( foreigner spicy ) . The place is vibrant and colourful . Ohh !! Did I mention that there always a long wait as it's mostly packed !!!  Well that can be compensated by their delicious food .,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin R.,"Great place to eat, friendly staff and convenient location! 10 out of 10 when it comes to food quality, only issues I've ever had was with the wait time but other then that I recommend this place to anyone looking to treat themselves to an amazing meal.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacqueline J.,"Cool and relaxed environment. Make sure to make a reservation to avoid the lines. Enjoyed the food but not mind blowing, had the share platter and pad gra pow with pork.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Naz A.,Love this place! Great Thai food and I believe the people who opened this place came from Khao San Road (another great thai place nearby) - so it's obviously really good. Great vibes and energy and good ambience. Pretty decor and food is very well presented.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Taz F.,"By far one of the best bar/reso combo in Toronto. Located in a half basement of a building, the atmosphere really pulls you in. The crowd looks and sounds like they are having the time of their lives, and why wouldn't they be? The food is amazing. I have at this point tried the entire menu, and you cannot go wrong with any option. The wings are great to start with, while the soup brings warmth. The food is so delicious with the meats being well marinated. My favorite dish is the coconut curry served in a coconut. Make sure to scrape the coconut for all the creme. The bar offers tons of variety as well. Bring your friends or your family either way you will have a blast.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Saloni S.,"We went here on a Friday evening after work. The place was extremely crowded which was expected because it was Friday. However, the rap music they were playing was loud and unpleasant and there were speakers producing piercing and jarring sounds on every corner. I go to loud bars and live music venues all the time but this was on a whole another level. What made the experience worse is the choice of songs! If all you want to do is eat your meal and avoid talking to the person you came with, this is the place to go to. I am never going back, you've been warned!",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hira S.,"I love their pad thai, food in general is awesome but just a little cramped in seating.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dean H.,What an awesome place!! It felt like my last visit to Thailand. The food was great and the atmosphere was as well.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sharon Y.,"Tried this restaurant after my fiance checked yelp reviews. It's a hidden basement restaurant with simple decor trying to mimic Thai street restaurant vibes. We went with a table of four and ordered the green coconut curry fish in a fresh coconut served with jasmine rice (delicious, sweet and creamy, very satisfying but it gets very filling quickly), Thai wings (flavourful and savoury with fried bits of kaffir lime leaf and strong hits of lemongrass served with a delicious tamarind sauce), green papaya salad serves with pork rinds and shrimp chips (this was very authentic and close to what we had in Thailand though it couldve used a bit more dressing), it was fresh, light and tasty and probably my favourite of the night. We also ordered the chef nuit pad Thai (it was good, not great, the noodles were clumped together, not overly flavourful but it wasn't terrible either..not your average red sauce pad Thai you get at other joints BC it was authentic and made with tamarind paste which was nice) last thing we ordered was the khao soi (a red creamy coconut curry with beef and egg noodles) it was pretty good, haven't had this before so cant really compare it but I'm not usually a fan of such heavy, creamy based carby dishes...had a small portion and I didn't want to touch it anymore. Worth going to if you want a taste of Thailand close to home! Our bill came to about 100 bucks plus a beer out the door, wasn't a lot a lot of food but I didn't leave hungry.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brian K.,Green curry with chicken was absolutely the best I've had. I've traveled a lot and this no different than what you'd find in Thailand. Service was outstanding even with out two bratty kids being disruptive.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hirbod A.,"the BEST thai food ive ever had!! definitely call and reserve ahead of time, we had to wait 30 minutes on a tuesday night which isnt too bad. definitely worth the wait though.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Manisha V.,"I usually go to Pai for lunch during weekdays with my collegues.It is always very crowded and sometimes the wait is a bit too long.However,they take you phone number and message you once your turn comes up..
I am a big fan of their Khao Soi with chicken breast.The quantity is a lot and I usually have to take it to go.All other dishes I have tried in their menu has been equally good.
If you are going for Appetizers,do try their spring rolls,they are THEE BEST.
It is my go to place when I am craving Thai food and I am never disappointed.
However,I am not a big fan of their seating arrangement.The tables are very close to each other and the chairs are not very comfortable but I guess that is their theme.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Erwin M.,"I'm always hesitant giving 5 star reviews but I can't really think of a better thai experience in recent memory. Massaman curry, khao soi, green curry, and prad gra prow, all as good or better than I had hoped for. Price was reasonable for the level of quality, and I liked the side chilli that came with the khao soi. I was expecting long lineups but at around 12:40pm on a weekday, we immediately got seats. One very satisfied customer here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nikita K.,I have been here a couple of times for dinner and their food is SO DELICIOUS!!!  Especially the yam fritters and and the Khao Soi with braised beef.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica W.,Very flavourful and daily shots are good deals~ always my come back places.. love their coconut curry~!!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,V C.,I had the green curry here. It was okay to me. Maybe I'm just not too into Thai food in general.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie Y.,"Food is delicious as usual, service is good for how busy it is. The place loses a star because it can get crazy loud on weekend dinners to the point that you're pretty much yelling at each other to talk across the table. The inability to enjoy the company of your friends takes away from the dining out experience. But otherwise, great food and would go back for a quick lunch where I don't really need to talk to anyone.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M M.,"I asked the bartender what veggies were in the panang curry dish . He said,  peas and green peppers most likely.  I ordered the dish as a vegan meal, with tofu as the protein. The dish arrived in a bowl filled near to the top. As I started to eat I realized there were many mushrooms that I mistook for tofu. I started to remove the mushrooms from the bowl to find that half the bowl was made up of mushrooms and only three tiny pieces of tofu/protein. I would not have ordered this dish if I had known it was 95% mushrooms/mushroom stew. I asked the waiter if I could have some tofu for the curry sauce that was in the serving bowl, now less than half full. I showed him the giant pile of mushrooms and tiny bits of tofu in the bowl. The waiter asked the manager who immediately (!) refused the request. I could only get tofu if I paid for it.  I would not return to this restaurant based on the lack of information listed on the menu and given by staff.  Rejecting such a simple fix to their mistake is also a sign of poor customer service. They do not care about their customers. The waiter did ask if he could see if they would remake it, and I said no thanks. I didn't want my partner to wait on me when all that was needed was some tofu.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David M.,"Beat tai in Toronto hands down.  Also a hangover cure, their spicy pad thai w chicken is amazing, coconut chicken green curry is on point and their kau soy noodle dish w chicken is a discovery me and my girl love.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hilary C.,I really recommend the pad Thai with extra shrimp! I went there without no reservation and had to wait 20 minutes as the restaurant is quite popular. It was a busy night and once we got our table a server didn't come to us until 25 mins in... and gave us the wrong receipt....,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Martin W.,"Yummy and delicious Thai food. I'm a big fan of the curries here. I don't think I have had a dish that wasn't really good. Of course, that's probably why it is always busy here. So yea you'll probably have to wait a bit and yea the service is a little slow, but keep yourself busy with some good company, have a beer, and soak in the atmosphere. Then when the food comes enjoy it, because you're in for a treat.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Navneet V.,"Friday night.. Waited 45 minutes to get into the restaurant.. And another 30 minutes to get a seat. My patience, on the verge of breaking, was soothed on the first spoonful of the most mindblowing Thai curry I've had in my life! However, if you come from South Asia/South East Asia and you think you can handle the ""Thai Spice"" level option on their menu, think again and just go for the ""Farang (foreigner) spice"" level.. Excellent food and brilliant service amidst all that chaos!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Martinus A.,Always enjoy the food in this place. A default if we're craving for some good Thai food in the city. The only drawback of the popularity is the long line up. You might want to come at odd hours.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Claire M.,"Really good food and atmosphere. It's my go to place in this area when you want something a little nicer than a pub or sports bar, but don't want to spend an arm and a leg. Would be a good date place I think.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Oliver C.,"This place is very good. Got the spiciest Pad Thai, had a solid burn for those who like spice. Otherwise I'd recommend the mild Pad Thai. This place seems to be permanently packed with a 30 to 45 minute wait. We got lucky and sat at the bar immediately, but definitely make a reservation ahead of time or be ok with s long wait. It's worth it though.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mariana T.,"Everything here is amazing. Great to eat in, cool vibe, awesome take out. The pad Thai is delicious! So is the green curry! Honestly, everything I've tasted has been delicious and does not disappoint. Highly recommend this place it is definitely a favourite!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ellen D.,"Pai is outstanding. The food is fresh and authentic and delicious. It is very busy and only take very limited reservations, but if you get there early, the wait is generally pretty short. The space is lively and very noisy, but not in a bad way, unless you are trying for a romantic evening or a serious chat. This is the best Thai food in town. Get the squash fritter.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea F.,"Food is excellent.  We each sampled a main, I had the green curry which came in a coconut, and they were all very, very good.  The papaya salad is a great starter. 
The one drawback is that the drinks are quite expensive.  I asked the waitress if they had any smoothies (I'm a wimp when it comes to spice) and she recommended a mango something or other drink which comes served in a pineapple with a shot of alcohol.  While it was a very good drink she failed to mention the drink was $15!! 
We got there at 7:30 and the place was already packed with a long line.  make reservations if you can.
Would definitely recommend to anyone.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Beth K.,"Great atmosphere with amazing food and friendly service. Everyone in my family ordered a different dish, and all of them were delicious. I had the Khao Soi with chicken, and I would absolutely come back and order it again. The lemongrass iced tea was light and refreshing on a warm summer day, especially as we were seated outside. It was a near perfect dining experience!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jim M.,Very tasty. I like the Pai marketplace when it gets very busy there.  Staff are courteous and fast.  I look forward to returning.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen C.,"Good vibe (it's basically a basement so it gets quite loud) and good food. Service is attentive but the food is very slow. Would not recommend if you are in any type of hurry. 
Tea Ross is an excellent beverage, as is the base Thai iced tea.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ali L.,We came here during lunch but we're fortunate enough to be early enough to get to the restaurant before lunch hour rush hit. We didn't have a reservation but were seated on a high table by the kitchen. We ordered three dishes: pad thai ($13); Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup ($13) & Khao Soi Braised Beef ($13). The paid thai and the khao soi were actually quite good and we would return for these dishes; however the chiang mai beef noodle soup wasn't all that amazing. The taste was okay but it bore similarity to the khao soi but the khao soi definitely shone through.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rahul R.,"I love Pai. It makes me happy on so many levels. I love the Pad Gra Prau. I love that I can get my food Thai or Foreigner spicy. I love the music they play. I love the sake. The only challenge is the wait as there are often long lines. But damn, this place is great.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kylin C.,"Awesome food but the portions can be bigger.    If you were really in Bangkok, you would get good portions for a couple of bucks.
Really noisy in there but it contributed to the atmosphere.  This is probably one of the better Thai restaurants in Toronto - the others (like Golden Thai) are all fakes and are meant to take white people for a ride.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara B.,"Best Thai place I have been in Toronto, It is not pricey and it is cozy and delicious.",5

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniel L.,"Love the appetizers. Overall had a good experience, especially because it was family dinner. And especially if youre a foodie",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Serena L.,Pai has some awesome Thai food. I love the decor of the restaurant and I will definitely be coming back to try more items on the menu.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tony L.,"The interior gives off a hippie and chill vibe which is cool. Had the spring rolls, khao soi and thai iced tea. Spring rolls were crunchy and stuffed with vermicelli noodles. Khao soi was flavourful,beef was tender and the curry broth was thick. Thai iced tea was not too sweet which i liked. My only complaint is that the khao soi was warm and not hot. Good atmosphere and food overall.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Teddy B.,"Really great food, great ambience and service perfect. I have had the best experience so far in a restaurant.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James B.,"This place is for real. In Toronto for two weeks for work and I had to come here a few times. The food: outside of the Tom Yum and pad Thai, I couldn't tell you because it's literally all I could order - so freaking good. The drinks - delicious. The service - worth 10 stars if I could. If you're lucky, you'll be greeted at the bar by Dolly and the gentlemen working with her when I was there. Don't fear the line to get in, it goes quick and there is a really thoughtful foyer full of stories of love, history, family and travel. And the wait is quick when you enjoy their blackberry mojito as you prepare for some reallllly good Thai food. I'll be dreaming of that Tom Yum for a long time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,A A.,"3.5 stars.
My cousin rented out a room at the back for her birthday dinner.  Upon entering, I noticed that this place was jam-packed and noisy.  Nevertheless, I soon acclimatized to the aforementioned noise pollution and attributed it to the bountiful liquor and positive vibes in this place.
I ordered the Gaeng Kiaw Wan which is ""Green Curry with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, green peppers and coconut milk. Served in a coconut!"" w/ Chicken.  I pretty much ordered it because it was served in a coconut (gimmicks ftw).  It turned out to be super delicious, but the portion was fairly small.  Also, the coconut is legit - you can scrape the coconut jelly off the inside and eat it too.
A downside to the experience was that they couldn't give us separate bills, and so there was about 20 of us trying to pool bills and coins tgh.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,A M.,"This is a really great spot for Thai food. I was on a business trip and on my own for lunch so I popped in to order take away. They were quick to greet me and point me to the end of the bar where I could order. There are menus right on the side of the counter if you want to take a look. One of my favorite dishes of all time is Khao Soi so I was delighted to see it on the menu (although being that it is a Northern Thai kitchen, I expected it and was the only reason I picked this place). They took my order quickly, and pointed to some chairs I could sit at while I waited. They were kind enough to offer water while I waited. I took the food back to my hotel and was really happy to see that they packed the crispy noodles separately to keep them crunchy. It was delicious! I wish that I had ordered extra noodles so I could have slurped up every last drop of that broth.
If I am back in the downtown area, I would go out of my way to come back here...although I might dine in this time (the place looks really cute).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bailey A.,"OMG SO GOOD.  Had the green curry out of a coconut!  Delicious!  Service was impeccable.  My friend accidently splashed some sauce on her shirt so she wet her napkin in her water to get the stain out.  Within 30 seconds, our waiter showed up with fresh glass of water cuz he noticed she dipped her napkin in the first glass!  That is attentive service - take notes people!
Wish I could eat here everyday, it's amazing.  Better than the other thai restaurants in Toronto (I've been to a lot).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clara L.,"I came here a couple days ago with two others. It was 6pm on Thursday and we didn't have to wait for a table (yay!). To share, we had the 'grabong' (deep fried squash fritters), and the 'khao pla tawt' (crispy basa fillets), both of which we loved. They had the perfect amount of crisp and weren't greasy at all. The 'khao soi' with braised beef was also really good. The curry sauce was very flavourful and we loved the texture of the fresh egg noodles. 
The papaya salad, however, was a disappointment. It was served deconstructive, as in the different components and ingredients were separated on one dish, and it made it difficult to eat and share with others. Also, the taste just wasn't right - everything was really raw and left an unpleasant bitter aftertaste. Maybe it was just me. I thought the other dishes and drinks made up for the salad though. The mango shake and cocktail with cucumber and gin stood out and complimented the heavy food well.
Besides being a busy place, the music really adds to the noise in the restaurant, making it really loud. Even though we were a small group of three it was hard to carry on a good conversation. Nevertheless, I'd still come back to try the other dishes.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris L.,"I've lived downtown for nearly 16 years, and witnessed many cool restaurants fall by the wayside, only to be renovated into a Milestones or Hooters. I'm so happy that Pai, the new kid in town, is garnering some good business!
This place has it all!  A great atmosphere, reasonable prices, delicious food (that doesn't shy away from genuine thai flavours and spices), and friendly, helpful staff.
I return here often, and recommend this place all the time!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mel H.,Had a great time here. Food is yummy but definitely overpriced. Creative and inviting interior is a bonus. Don't visit when you are in a hurry because the tables fill up fast and food comes out slow.,4

The service at PAI was fantastic. Even though there was a wait, I was seated within minutes. My server was very friendly and at no point did I need to call him over or get his attention, simply because he was so attentive. He knew the menu and even the drink menu well.
FOOD:
Gai Satay
Perfectly cooked chicken, a decent portion size for an appetizer. The peanut sauce was good, although I wish it had a little more kick to it. 4/5
Pad Thai
This is PAI's signature dish. I ordered it ""farang spicy"" which is just above medium and means ""foreigner spicy"". The heat was a bit much for me but the flavour of the pad thai was still good. I wouldn't say this is the greatest pad thai I've ever had just because like the peanut sauce, it needed a little more flavour, but overall still very good. Portion size wasn't massive but definitely satisfying. 3.5/5",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle L.,"Pai never disappoint me. If you are looking for affordable dinning option in downtown core but show off your hip side, Pai is the place. I always love Thai food, and yes Toronto get plenty to offer, but considering the location and never failing Green Curry in a coconut, Pai becomes my go-to place if my dinning buddy is too lazy to come out with any suggestions. It is chill enough to not to dress in full suits, and not too noisy that you won't have a conversation. If you have not tried this place, check it out before or after you catch a movie in the Scotiabank theatre nearby. Btw, I also like the Basa fish they offer!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Debanjana K.,The best Thai food I've ever had. My parents recently went to Thailand and while she was visiting me in Toronto I took her to Pai and she loved the food too. The decor is simple and their's nothing fancy about the presentation but the food is soooo good!!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Suhel K.,"Love the green curry, pad Thai and the khao soi noodles. Red curry not that great but I'm ok to get it somewhere else!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susan D.,"My favorite Thai restaurant downtown, hands down! The chicken wings (THE BEST), the green curry, papaya salad, tom yum soup, pad thai and the pad grow are my favorites! I come here on a regular basis, service is good- however services could be a bit more attentative, takes a little while to wave someone down.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alicia P.,"Definitely make a reservation, this place gets super booked up. When I came an hour before closing there was a 45 min wait. Thankfully they were seating on the stage (aka floor seating) and I got sat immediately. I tried the green curry which comes presented in a small coconut. It was okay, not my favourite. My favourite dish was the Tom yum soup, super flavourful. I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes, some sound really authentic. Service is super fast and nice!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carlton M.,I just came back from Thailand and this Restaurant food is better than anything I got from there. The flavours can't be beat. The ambience is unreal and feels like you are out of the country. Must try. Only downside is that it is so popular on weekends there is a wait.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy V.,"Great options for omnivores and vegans alike. The atmosphere is so cool and although there's usually a bit of a wait time to get a seat, the food is totally worth the wait!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pari P.,"Loved every dish at this vibrant relaxed restaurant. Friday night and glad we had reservations. We were a party of 8 and each dish was delicious. Highlights I'd say were the squash fries, sautéed water spinach, and my fave massamam curry. Note-the spice level Medium is pretty spicy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ankur C.,Just checked into Toronto and found this Thai place for lunch. Had high expectations based on reviews and wasn't let down. Great food! Ordered green curry with chicken- awesome taste and chicken was cooked just right (not over-cooked like most other Thai places). My wife got pad Thai- usually I can't eat it at all (don't like it)- but when I tasted that fish it was amazing! Wished I ordered that as well.  Highly recommend this place. In addition to great food it has a very nice ambience too.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jude T.,Great spot for Thom Yum Soup. Good beer selection. Great service. I'll be back again.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jon T.,Excellent vegan options. Very friendly and helpful staff. Cool atmosphere. Will definitely go back when I'm in Toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jill G.,"amazing food!  Incredibly helpful staff.  I booked their family style room for a birthday party and they couldn't have been more helpful.  The food was amazing, the staff was amazing, the chef came out to chat with us - they accommodated our many food quirks - really fantastic!  Thank you guys!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,CN B.,I like the food but you must either come early or make a reservation to guarantee seating.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tofu T.,"Great place, truly traditional... My husband and I love spicy, but beware, Thai spicy is a whole new level! Delicious food, but I recommend a reso, it took us a few times to finally get in because of their long wait times.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel O.,"My husband and I love Thai food, so we ordered some takeout for ourselves and three kids on a Sunday night.  We had chicken pad Thai, shrimp pad Thai, spring rolls, and jasmine rice.  Everything was really good!  My husband said it was the best pad Thai he's ever had.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sumit W.,I love Thai food and if it is nicely made then it is even better. Chicken skewers where awesome so was Thai chicken curry. Thai ice tea was so refreshing.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alec B.,Absolutely incredible. Vibes are amazing and food is great. Nicely priced and the drink menu is extensive and full of variety.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jose Z.,"Favorite Thai place in the city right now, both for food and ambiance, by far! I've been here a number of times and given this is my first yelp review I figured I should start with a high note and one of my most recent visits. 
The deco is fun, relaxed, and in the style of a Thai bar right out of Pai. The drink(cocktail) list is also really cool and has clever names inspired by the Toronto raptors lineup.
Overall the food is spectacular. From the authentic tasting papaya salad, to the incredibly complex masaman curry, and the house pad thai (named after   Nuit herself), it's truely hard to find a miss.
5/5 all 4 or 5 times I've been here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,CheSooJung ..,"Trendy little spot for decent pad thai but not worth the wait or the lack of personal space.  After a 20m wait, we were crammed into a tiny table where my 6'4"" partner was barely able to get his knees under the table or put food in his mouth without elbow-jabbing the person next to him.  If you like the food, just order take-out.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea F.,Yummmmy! It is hard to find good Northern Thai in Toronto. The curry was so flavourful. The rest of the dishes at the table looked great. They spice fairly aggressively so beware if you are not good with spicy. I went the second to most spicy and it was very authentic. Solid yet impersonal service. Small but good beer choices.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Athmika P.,Always busy but they move through tables really quickly! Be ready to stand in line. Pretty much everything on the menu is terrific.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex P.,Ate at the bar as it was very busy- the food was phenomenal.  Highly recommended.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jaimmie R.,Everything I've had here is delicious. Do not expect fast service - this place is laid back but really popular so you're bound to wait longer than normal for your food. BUT the wait is always worth it. The Massaman curry is the best in the city.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thomas B.,"Really good food in a cool divey bar off of Adelaide. My girlfriend and I during a weekend getaway to Toronto were in the mood for Tai and found Pai. When you walk down the steps you will be greeted by classic rock, savory smells and a smiling staff. For appetizers the spring rolls were fantastic and the Chicken Pad Thai did not disappoint either! For those who like their food hot, the Farang Spicy was not very spicy so if you enjoy the heat give the Phet Mak Mak (the spiciest) a shot. All in all, four hours after walking out Pai had us wanting more!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ariette H.,"Came here yesterday night with my girlfriends for a Galentine's Day/a friend's belated birthday celebration dinner; and it was wonderful! Loved the restaurant ambience. It was busy, but not too loud. It's edgy and eclectic in both their interior design and music - loved the playlist of throwbacks yesterday, so great. The food was delicious and the server was friendly. The Khao Soi, Pad Thai and Grapong were delicious. We also had the sake bomb shots which were quite good ;) Hahaha.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew W.,"I have visited and had take out from here kids of times - Always get amazing food at Pai, and it's very reasonably priced. One of my favourite spots in the city!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole B.,Best Thai food! I visit or get takeout every trip to Toronto! I've even walked close to a mile in January frigid temps to pick up my order! Go early or prepare to wait!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shivi G.,Amazing food! The freshness and veggie friendly dishes makes this our go to thai place. Great for a lunch or dinner.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,François B.,"Amazing food, and great atmosphere... think twice when you order how spicy you want your food, because when they say it's spicy... they really mean it!
Green curry served on a coconut was not only visually appealing, but also a treat to my taste buds, and the Pad Thai had the real tamarind taste it should have.
Will be back for sure!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jelena S.,Tasty but the portions are on the weak side.... too much rice and too little toppings.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vincent Z.,Tomyam Soup is served in cold and frozen shrimp is not warm yet in the soup. It's a bar style restaurant and doesn't give any ambience of Thai.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lily G.,"The space is pretty cool. It has a street- like vibe. Went there aroud 5pm on a weekday, didn't have to wait but the restaurant filled up quickly. Tables are rather close to each other. Ordered pad thai and it was delicious.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mick P.,"Ate here three times in the last 2 weeks. On work assignment from NYC where we have many very good Thai choices. Holy basil chicken (Thai spice level) is as good as anywhere, as is masaman curry. Of the 5 dishes I've eaten I'd recommend all of them. So, dine here with confidence. For those able to tolerate heat, Farang may not be hot enough. Thai level is truly spicey.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Luis C.,"Had lunch here recently. Good food, good service, left happy. Nothing in my mind that truly stuck out as fantastic, but no complaints either.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Peter Iljung Y.,"Came here a few days ago with a friend and had the Moo Ping appetizer, Gaeng Kiaw Wan and Pad Gra Prow. The food portions were very good and the food itself were great as well. 
Service was a bit on the slower side but understandably so because it was pretty packed in the restaurant. That being said, definitely make reservations if you're going during busy times as there are almost always line-ups to be seated. 
I would for sure come back!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vicki S.,"Quite possibly the best Thai food I've ever had. Visited here from New York, and taken by someone who's been to and eaten all around Thailand. Thoroughly impressed by the flavor, balance, and portions.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cheryl W.,"The food is great here! 4 Stars and not 5 because they are always busy. I ordered my khao soi via Ritual app, it took 45 mins...I think that's a little long considering they stuff is already made they just scoop it up...you can see it when you pay at the back. Also ordering via the app..my noodle portion was way smaller then eating there...it was half the portion. Also if you like the chips that they give you, you can order a bag. It's not on the menu but the charge around $5.00 for a bag the sauce is amazing. must get. Definitely one of my favorite thai restaurants in town.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Theresa L.,"This is my go to for no frills, consistently good Thai food. The Chicken Pad Thai and Green Curry with Fish are winners; as are the sweet potato fritters! 
They do takeout and delivery which is amazing!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John T.,As good as it gets! The gra bong is to die for. Not cheap but very worth it.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Suresh S.,Very poor service and equally bad food. Tried to placade us by giving 30% discount. I did not go to the place to get discount.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cassie L.,average Thai restaurant. I like their pad thai and thai ice tea,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Syl R.,"I've tried almost everything on their dinner menu never leave disappointed! If you're going to drink something, I highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Melenie T.,"I didnt find the service to be spectacular. We came for lunch on an average day, and It felt like there were lots of staff, but none that greeted us excitedly or checked in to see if we were liking the food. The restaurant has a cool vibe with lots of art and would be a great place to take visiting out of town friends. Dont expect normal cheap thai food, but the food is good!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tahmina N.,"One of three places I like to think of as the 'holy trinity' of Thai food in Toronto (other two being Khao San Road and Sukho Thai...and maybe Sabai Sabai but that ruins the trinity). Pai has great dishes. My personal favorites are the Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and Khao Soi. But I do feel that the quality of their Pad Thai has slipped a bit recently in terms of flavour. I've gone on several occasions and the rest of my party has never been disappointed.  We usually get a couple of appetizers to share. Our favorite is the Gra Pong. The menu is pretty much the same as the rest of the trinity. Taste is practically the same as well, apart from the Pad Thai, which I think Sukho Thai does the best job of. Pai's bonus is that you can reserve a table online. Great for small or large groups, as long as you reserve early.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie C.,"Great food. Not quite your traditional Thai menu, it's a nice alternative to your local spot but it has it's drawbacks. First, after eating here three times I feel as though I'm bored with the flavours of the menu. Everything kind of tastes the same. Second, the place is always packed. I've never waited less than an hour for a seat at the bar. 
It's fun. It's popular. It's loud. The food is consistent. I will return but at this point I'm bored of Pai's offerings.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Frederic K.,Have been here couple times. Service and food here never disappoint me. This is the place to get some authentic Thai food.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rafia J.,"Amazing thai food! If you're a fan of SukhoThai, this is a must try! We ordered squash fritters, Green curry and Massaman curry. My favourite was the Massaman curry, though, very very hot! Be watchful that curry creeps on you! Nonetheless, absolutely delicious! The beef was so tender and juicy and the curry was full of flavor! Loved the ambiance, a little underground, hip spot. Portions are good and each dish is around $15. Can't wait to go back there! Oh, and be ready to wait 45 minutes to an hour if you go during the evening time or weekends!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aiden R.,"Great food! Some of the best Thai food I've ever had. Ordered the pad Thai, the Tom yum soup and the basil leaf salad with shrimp. Awesome flavors",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aron T.,"Great location, food was limited to their specialties and my family loved the environment. The food wasn't bad but wasn't the best I guess it depends on the dish, pad Thai had too much lime but everything else was great. I just wished they left the water instead of waiting to be served every time.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Louise P.,"I love this place. The food is unreal. I had the Pad Thai both times because I was craving it for days after I had it the first time. The Thai tea is super good, as is the lemongrass iced tea, super refreshing! My friends had a few different dishes and all of them were very pleased with their meals. I will definitely be back for more pad thai, and maybe to try something new at Pai!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Logan L.,"Love this place! Super fun atmosphere with awesome dishes. Gets very busy though, so make a reservation in advance.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nate T.,Honestly wasn't that impressed. Food was decent but definitely not worth the wait. I'd prefer a more traditional thai menu versus a fusion style menu; there just weren't enough good choices and I felt kind of handcuffed. There was also no option to make my dish extra spicy...I had to get chili paste. The bartender had to get his manager to make a gin martini for me and the service was pretty slow.,2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rabi C.,"Great, great, great food! Went there with a small baby, they were able to accommodate in the new section. You have to either make reservations in advance (like weeks in advance) or go at 4pm or 5pm. Green curry, massam curry, pad Thai, spring rolls, everything we tried was incredibly delicious. Highly recommend!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zayn J.,"Honestly one of the best thai restaurants, if not THE BEST, I've had in Toronto. 
Each time, the chicken Pad Thai is my go-to and it has never failed me. Even order on Uber Eats, it's so delicious and I'm pretty sure they packed more in the container! Honestly the best pad thai I've ever had. If you know one better, by all means let me know and I challenge you to try this one. Seriously, you'd think plain pad thai can't be amazing but this one would prove you wrong.
The green-curry is really nice, but if you don't get it spicy, it can be a bit bland. Loved the flavours, loved everything about it. 
Both these dishes are very tasty and very filling. You do feel satisfied afterwards and rightfully so.
The Khao So wasn't especially great, I won't lie. The flavour was too strong and was a little oily. Maybe it's just not my taste. 
Hard to get a table sometimes after work, but the fact that they deliver on Uber Eats or you can order to go is great.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nevi N.,Not worth it at all. The sangria was over priced and watered down. The food was below average. No intention of going there again.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Taymee Y.,"Taste like home! 
We ordered Pad Thai Shrimp, Somtam Tad, Kao Soi chicken, Sai ua and Tom Yum Kung Mor Fai. 5 happy dishes for 3 people.
Pad Thai here is not as saucy as ones at KSR but equally delicious: 
will def. go back :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Warren S.,"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is one of the Entertainment District's newest arrivals, and the brainchild of Gusto 101's Janet Zuccarini and Nuit and Jeff Regular. This restaurant, which is tucked away from the chaotic King street crowd onto Duncan street (South of Adelaide), maintains an underground aura (quite literally, too) with beautiful, quaint, and cozy decor. 
Notwithstanding the question of ""authenticity,"" which is somewhat raised by the hipster-y crowd, I was thoroughly impressed with my chicken pad thai. I also got a good chuckle out of the ""spiciness"" scale, which includes a ""foreigner"" level for those who can tolerate the heat but maybe not to the same degree of those who hail from Thailand. The presentation of the meal was absolutely perfect, even though it lacked a bit of sweetness. Also, the noodles weren't overly saturated in peanuts, which was a plus for me.
I washed down my meal with a drink called ""Amir Johnson"" (and yes, it was named after Toronto Raptor power forward/centre player). This cocktail was packed with a punch in the form of scotch and amaretto, which beautifully complemented and neutralized the spice of the pad thai. 
A friendly tip: it's safe to come here in a party of two, as many of the tables are configured to seat that many people at any given time. If you come here with a party of 3+, you might have to wait a while to be seated. In the event of the latter, you might luck out and get the table where you are obliged to take off your shoes and are surrounded by a cavalcade of colourful pillows.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kit R.,"As someone who is very familiar with street food in Bangkok, I could say that Pai is the closest one could get to authentic thai street food in Toronto. 
Coming from the east end, I am extremely disappointed with the Thai selection in Scarborough or North York. In these parts, Thai restaurants are usually run by Chinese people who serve Ketchup pad Thai and watery green curry. So I go downtown when I can for my Thai food fix.
I find their lunch specials to be of good value. I usually judge how good a Thai restaurant is from two dishes: the Panang curry and the krapow. This place serves both and exceptionally well. Portions are just right, but the flavour is THERE. And that's all that matters. Just the right amount of spice, and the ingredients are really fresh. 
Don't let its location in the heart of the financial/entertainment district turn you off. This is more authentic Thai than anywhere in the Spadina strip. 
I would give this an ""A"" to ""A+"" in my book. I wish the pad Thai was slightly less sweet and they could turn down a notch the slight hipster ambience and give it more like an actual Soi Sukhumvit street vibe.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,K E.,"Though it's quickly becoming packed like Khao San Road, it's still a good choice for the area.
The Khao Soi (with tofu for me) is great to warm up during the winter months, and still tasty the rest of the year.  Chef Nuit's Pad Thai is good, but not remarkably better than the pad thai available elsewhere.
It's not as noisy as KSR, and for a little while it was easier to get in.  That's quickly changing as people in the area are becoming aware of it's relationship to other great options around.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Regnard R.,"Situated in a nice area in Toronto, I'm a fan of Pai for its great food.
I particularly love the pad thai and the good thing is that it's priced well, too. I could literally go there and have the pad thai and call it a great day.
I wish there are better accessible entrances as the place is in a basement. If there are elevators there, I have yet to find them.
Over-all, Pai is a solid Thai place with a very satisfying pad thai.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin S.,"Its really good stuff. Thai food from a very specific region. They served me my green curry in a coconut! Very unique.
Great decor and they play some really good chill beats.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ninoko A.,"Food was good but not worth the wait. We arrived around 9pm and waited for 20 minutes to get seated, and then we waited for half an hour for our food, which I suppose shouldn't have taken this long. Overall the food was nice (the coconut water was delicious), but my friends and I were disappointed.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,B V.,"I don't know if my tastes of changed (most likely) or I just didn't get a good one initially because I DO like their Pad Thai now. Previously KSR had the hands-down best but it just didn't taste the same and at least Pai has a lot more protein options. Unfortunately my shrimps were way overcooked (you know how they say shrimp should look like a ""C"" and if they're overcooked they look like an ""O""? Two of my shrimp looked like curly fries) but the noodles themselves were still great.
My favourite here is either the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle soup (I wish it could be spicier but the tamarind broth tastes great and they give a LOT of beef), or the Fried Fish with Green Curry (make sure to not accidentally order Green Curry Fish; it's cheaper but the fish has no breading and is swimming in the curry rather than being fried and on the side). 
They also have a very consistent spice level (unlike Salad King which either tastes like nothing or tastes like ghost pepper noodles even though I always ask for a 4) and the various food apps really help for take out.
I tried the Pai Market a few times but wasn't too wowed by it; I just stick with the regular menu for now.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura C.,"I came here for a work event and got to embark on Chef Nuit's Northern Food Trek. For the next 3 hours, I ate course after course of mind-blowing Thai food. Gai satay. Mountains of squash fritters. Papaya salad with fresh lemongrass. Perfectly deep fried spring rolls. Pad Thai so good you can't stop eating it even though you were full half an hour ago.   Green coconut curry that'll make you reconsider everything you've ever eaten before. And the sauces. So many tasty sauces to go with everything. And to end it off, fresh coconut sorbet. So save yourself the trip to Thailand and go eat everything here instead.*
* You should still go to Thailand. It's fantastic. Just a tad far away for food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sadao K.,I love this place foods! So yummy and service is good. Alway line up. Atmosphere is nice and Tai style. Quick service. I want to come back here soon.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jianian T.,"One of the best Thai place I have ever been.  The beef noodle soup is amazing.  The stage is a little uncomfortable,  but it will take time to adjust.  Makes a good bed though.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark S.,"I miss this place so much. Don't be intimidated by the line, it moves quickly, and it's worth it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Etienne B.,Definitely one of the best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand. Be ready for the wait but totally worth it! It's best to go on weekdays early. So far I have never been disappointed with anything I've had there. The curry in a coconut is delicious!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mr. S.,"I am not a Thai expert, but I have had my share of thai food. This place was really fine, but not anything special for me. I played it pretty safe with Pad-Thai. I consider my meal a little bit on the small portion size. The flavor was fine, but my local thai restaurant is better. 
The service was a little on the slow side, but nothing really bad. I just feel like I can get better. There were a bunch of old american record albums on the wall where I sat, I thought that was a little weird for thai, but also interesting.
This place does get crowded so be prepared to wait at peak times.
Sorry, PAI keep working on it.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Warren D.,I have been to Thailand and this place is probably the closest I have tasted to that authentic Thai experience! My favs are the green curry chicken and the Khao Soi with braised beef. The beef is so tender it  melts in your mouth!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel H.,"i cant believe ive never written a review about pai. this place is magnificent, the taste is incredible and the flavours are SO bold. if you're looking for bold and authentic thai food, pai is the place to be.
i have eaten nearly everything on the menu because i go so often. whenever i crave something, its usaully pai. I recommend ordering:
1. Squash Fritters for apps (its better than french fries, seriously. they use these amazing herbs i think)
2. Khao Soi - absolute BEST DISH IN THE WORLD. 
or
2. Green Curry in a coconut - you can scratch the inside of the coconut to eat the actual stuff
3. Mango Sticky Rice (beware, not always in season so they may not have it)
4. Thai Iced tea (which is a must)
seriously, everything on the menu is wonderful
i think this restaurant is even better than khao san because the chef decided to go away from it and make her own store (chef nuit), but i'm not positive about this fact. someone confirm!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dominic N.,"After bringing my girlfriend here for a date, we've been craving Pai regularly. The food is amazing and great environment and service.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,EunHee L.,"One of my fav thai restaurant in the city. I LOVE this place. If i go there next time, i will try green curry!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tang T.,"Such good Pad Thai!! Friends and I were extremely satisfied with the food and service here on the first visit. We had to wait for a 3 person table for 30-40 minutes but it was well worth it. Pad Thai here is just amazing! My second time here with 2 other friends, I also had to wait about the same time and again, it was worth it. To be frank, it wasn't as good as the first time but maybe it was just me. Anyhow, if you haven't tried the Pad Thai here yet, you shall soon.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joey V.,"Pai lives up to the average review of 4 stars.  The Panang Beef and Pad Thai were both very good and we loved the decor.  I'd probably rate it a 4.25/5 if able, with the slight ding due to the green papaya salad.  It wasn't bad, just a little too ""soupy"" for our liking.  Overall, if you're looking for a place to grab good Thai, a drink or two, and a fun atmosphere, Pai will more than suffice.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jessica C.,"This is my favourite Thai place downtown (have yet to try Sukho Thai. Did not like Khao San Road). I always order the chicken pad Thai and my bf always gets the Khao Soi - both very delicious. We have eaten in the restaurant (very colourful, but packed in the evenings and don't take reservations so be prepared to wait anywhere from 20-45 min, but they have a small bar area to wait where you can order drinks), but prefer to pickup and eat at home.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Keith P.,"Great food. Spicy, sour, bright. Not goopy, sweet, heavy. 
- Beef Salad 
- Fried rice w. pork belly and egg 
- Squash fritters",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah B.,Got the chance to try their Pad Thai since we got it catered at work - I'd say hands down Khao San Road tastes better (more authentic in my opinion).,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elle H.,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Pai is so cool and puts out such tasty food that it makes you never want to go back to your ho-hum neighborhood Thai place, unless it's out of loyalty with a dash of pity. My barometer for Thai food is always pad thai; if it's good, I want to return. Their pad thai is generously-portioned, veg-friendly and has a sauce that is deeply flavourful. On top of that, there's such a lively ambiance at Pai that smacks of dynamism, which is what we want more of in our lives, right?",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve S.,Amazing Thai food and great service.  Everything is authentic and fresh.  Thanks to Jeff and his team for a wonderful experience and a memorable meal.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ehsan F.,"Barbecued chicken on a stick was delicious.
These did not that long to make it either.
mediocre pricing",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ismail R.,It used to be authentic. Don't know what happened may be they changed chef or recipe; food doesn't have the same taste as before,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brianna G.,"This is easily one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! There is often a long line, but it is definitely worth the wait. You can also get takeout if you want to try the food without waiting in line. Some of my favourite things to order here are the tom yum soup, the gai satay, and Gaeng Kiaw Wan (in a coconut). The drinks are also very good, I recommend trying the tea ross, which is like a milk tea with alcohol. The atmosphere is lively. I highly recommend this restaurant!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,I.B. R.,"Great service, and very tasty food. I would give 5 stars but I find the drinks are not worth the price (we got a spicy p for 14 dollars and our green curry was the same price as the drink). But I highly recommend the food",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kat C.,I thought I had eaten authentic Thai in until now. This was by far the best tasting Pad Thai I've had in Toronto. I had the vegetarian option and it was super tasty. I didn't feel it even need to have chicken or shrimp. It was perfect. The ambiance was also friendly and chill and relaxed yet not boring. Busy but not annoyingly so. A popular spot for good reason. Highly recommended!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fee F.,"Get there early, the line is crazy
Food was great, also a good value. A must eat place in toronto",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joletta L.,"I cannot express how amazing the food quality is here. Although you have to wait in line to get seated, the food makes up for it. The portions are way more than expected especially the Fritters and Pad Thai. With a shared app and a main dish, I could barely eat half my entree or even finish the fritters. In regards to the ambience, if you're into a hip and loud environment this is the way to go especially with a small group. If you're looking for an intimate spot with privacy - this will be a bit difficult. I've dined and ordered out and to be honest take out takes a bit of time but once you take you first bite - you'll forget all about it. 4/5 stars just because of the wait time.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lori S.,My favourite every single time. No wonder it's so damn hard to get a table here.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sophia C.,"If you've been to Khao San Road or Nana and liked it, this place is right up your alley. Also all run by the same guy so no surprise there! Great variety of flavours and dishes for sharing as well as tasty appetizers and strong, delicious cocktails! 
In an area that doesn't have too many great food options unless you want burritos or overpriced pub food, Pai is a breath of fresh air! This place offers a casual atmosphere with cool decor and friendly staff. 
Try not to sit too close to the door in wintertime though - cold air blows right through! Also a good idea to make a reservation as it gets really busy during prime time dinner and weekend hours.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shu Y.,"My boyfriend and I work in New York and we have the tradition of traveling during the Xmas. Strongly suggested by my friends, we chose this place to have our dinner on the second day in Toronto. They have the BEST Thai food ever! Very crowded and busy though, it is better to make a reservation before you go!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Penny P.,The food is amazingly good every time I visited. The atmosphere makes me feel so relaxed and cheerful. I brought lots of friends here and they all like it so much. Highly recommended the dish called MORNING GLORY,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria D.,"Equally as delicious as it's neighbor Khao San, but significantly larger, so better for larger groups, but you'll probably still have to wait. The Kao Soi and Masaman curries were both super delicious! Good portion sizes as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gary C.,"We arrived Saturday night and had to wait in line for about 10-15 min just to reach the receptionist. We heard from those in front that the wait was around an hour. Luckily when we reached the receptionist they asked if we were okay to sit in an area where they can't serve liquor yet. We were starving so we decided to take them up. They brought us to the back in a room off to the side. The decor throughout the restaurant was really nice. 
We ordered Som Tum Tad (papaya salad) with salted crab. That was a delicious delicious dish as it had the right amount of chilli and tangy taste that worked well together. For our mains we ordered chef nuit pad Thai with pork and gaeng kiaw wan. Their pad Thai was good, I've never had it with pork before so that was a nice option. The gaeng kiaw wan which is their green curry came in a coconut bowl which was really nice. We scooped out the coconut meat to go along with the bamboo shoot and chicken. Presentation was good and had good flavours. Will need to come back again to try other dishes.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wil T.,Amazing thai food.  Consistently delicious with great prices! Food has flavour that explodes in your mouth.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jona A.,"wow over 2500 reviews and 4.6 rating awesome im gonna go tomorrow and then I ll update my review place looks amazing with so many positive experience , has to be great to get such reputation see you tomorrow",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Morgan D.,Amazing food and great atmosphere. Always a good place to go with colleagues at lunch and to bring folks in from out of town. The authentic vibe & food is really amazing!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenna H.,"Came here for the first time since this place was know for the best Thai in Toronto. However, we will feel like it was a little too hyped. The wait was almost 1 hour when we arrived. The servers were alright not great. The host was super nice. They send you a text when your table is ready. The food was a lot smaller than what we expected. We didn't think it was worth much of the price. However, it was still decent. Thai tea was a little too sweet. Fried chicken was only 3 pieces per order which was also alright. The pad Thai and coconut dish was good but too little. Kai Soi was a little salty but braised beef was tender.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chopstickspoon K.,Lobe everything at there. -1 star because it's always crowed and you may have to wait in a long line up.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Deb F.,"The food is good but the wait is LONG. You can like it all you want but waiting 1 1/2 hours for food on uncomfortable seating? I'm too old! Get better seating and a bigger space is my recommendation. I know, easy to say but far too long on three occasions. Sorry!",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mary C.,"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I've been a loyal fan of Chef Nuit (& Jeff!) since they opened up Sukhothai on Parliament steet, and I've been coming back for the Khao Soi noodle ever since. This is one of my go-to choices when I have friends visiting from out-of-town, because it's a perfect example of what makes Toronto such a great city to live in. Pai is authentic, diverse, delicious and fun. Plus, it's a family business that treats you like family.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley B.,"Pai has the best green curry in town. If you're vegetarian, go for the vegan veggies and tofu green curry. You will not be disappointed!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sandra G.,"Amazing food!  Worth waiting line!  The spring rolls we're a big hit at our table.  We look forward to going back, it would be great if you didn't have to line up and they took more reservations.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris M.,Food is delicious and great atmosphere inside. Heads up that this place gets very busy. Head out early or be prepared to wait in line. The wait is worth it.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Claresta S.,"The pad gra praw was so good! It has a good amount of spice, and the crispy pork and fried egg brought it to the next level",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nina D.,Incredible!  Best Thai food outside of Thailand.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Taylor W.,The appetizers at this place are delicious. I had the spring rolls and to tom yum soup. The spring rolls were tasty and the soup was absolutely delicious. I would definitely go back if just for that soup!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J J.,It has been so long since I had food that made me want to return to restaurant the next day for more. Pai is outstanding Thai. It really deserves the praise it gets and it different than the tonnes of Thai restaurants in city. We shared apps (spring rolls tasty not greasy) then the beef soup and mushroom stir fry. All delicious. Great portions. No sodium/msg headache after. Definitely will return to try other dishes.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha C.,"Went in a group of 4 and ordered as much as we could. Everything was top notch, but the spring rolls were next level. If it wasn't for the ridiculous wait times I would probably eat here all the time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gab L.,"Came here with a few friends on a Thursday evening at around 8 pm. As soon as we walked in, the place was packed. Surprisingly, they had a table available and the waitress sat us down right away. 
The atmosphere was absolutely delightful. I really enjoyed the dim setting and the decor, which was very unique. The music was also fantastic.
We got an order of the spring rolls to share, and as my main, I ordered the Khao Soi with braised beef. Everything was super tasty and fresh, and I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves authentic Thai food. Pricing is very affordable as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lea K.,"After hearing about Pai as the latest must-try Thai food joint, a visit ensued. It's a fairly decent sized restaurant, though busy enough on a Thursday night that there was a wait, tucked in the sub-level of a building off of Adelaide (and around the corner of the well-known and beloved Khao San Road). 
My date and I started with the grabong as an appetizer. The deep fried squash fritters were piled high and came out hot with a side of delicious garlic tamarind dip. For two people it is quite a lot of fritters, and definitely enough to stimulate the appetite of a larger group. 
I opted for the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken as my main and it definitely did not disappoint, especially at their ""foreigner spicy"" level of heat. It ranks amongst the more delicious pad Thais I've had in my life, though I've yet to visit Thailand for the 100% authentic stuff (grain of salt, if you so please). 
My date had the Khao Soi with braised beef. Having had this dish from Khao San Road many times, I have to say that the Khao Soi from Pai was nothing more special than from Khao San Road. Nevertheless, it was still delicious and the beef was oh-so-tender, you can't go wrong ordering it.
The service was decent during our visit. The server was attentive enough to refill our water glasses when they were looking empty, even though they left our table with a water carafe to help ourselves when needed.
The atmosphere at Pai is different from most Thai restaurants I've visited. From hearsay and others who have visited Thailand, it resembles a market or street from which you would eat authentic Thai food with it's weathered wooden tables and dim lighting. The crowd was mostly young patrons, but there were a few older parties dining as well.
I would recommend trying Pai if you can make a reservation, otherwise the wait times can be quite lengthy.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Phil B.,Outstanding maybe the best I've had excellent quality. I went twice my first 2 days visiting from NYC both times top notch.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kaiden L.,"There were a lot of people, but the wait wasn't too long. Staff was very friendly. The curry was good, one of the curries was served in a coconut shell! Would come again!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna L.,"This is hands down the best thai place ive ever had! Its not your normal thai restaurant.... its soooo good here! Ive had the khao soi(amazingly delicious) and pad gra. Everything is so tasty!! I dont usually like curry but this is so good, its balanced with sweet salty and savoury...... my husband and i couldnt get enough of this place and have been here many many times. Only warning is that it gets extremely packed!!!!!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cherr X.,"Went to try this place after reading rave reviews but found it to be a bit disappointing. Khao san road definitely wins in terns of flavour, authenticity, and quality. Had the green coconut curry, khao soi with beef, and grabong (squash fritters). That being said, it was still a decent meal and the khao soi had plenty of beef. 3.5/5",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marie Grace R.,"I ordered from here on UberEats App, so I'm not sure if its an accurate representation of their food. Overall the food quality was quite good, the green curry was delicious. We also had the Laap salad, which was kind of meh, a little too oily for my taste. Overall this is o e of the better Thai places in the city, quite authentic.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,みり,Food and drinks here are awesome!!! We waited in line for 40min but it is definitely worth waiting. I would say here's the best Thai restaurant in Toronto,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rania A.,"Made a reservation beforehand to avoid the long line. The service was very pleasant and they consistently checked up on us, despite how crazy packed it was. I got the khao soi and it was a little too sweet for my tasting but I know others would definitely enjoy it so it's not a minus for me. The pad Thai was more enjoyable and the fried squash fritters completely stole the show. The sauce for that was absolutely delicious, highly recommend. Their drinks are pretty strong and reasonably priced too. Overall a great experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny L.,"Best Thai restaurant in Toronto. Come early or make a reservation since this place fills up (or sit at the bar). They are known for the khao soi (egg noodles in curry). I got it with steamed veggies on the side since the dish is very creamy and has no veggies. Paired nicely with the braised beef, but probably good with chicken as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ric L.,The food here is amazing. Highly recommend the pad Thai and the drinks and the yam fries. It only got 4 stars because the wait is constantly long even when you're trying to talk to a server to sit for your reservation. Though it hasn't stopped me yet.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tara A.,Chicken Pad Thai is OUT of this world good. My favorite in the whole city. The shrimp chips and sauces are also amazing. It can be a bit busy but the food is totally worth the wait.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny Z.,"Came here with 2 friends - food is good but the service is just really slow. they have this system where you can ONLY be served by the person attending your table, so if you ever hail down one of the other waiters they'll just tell you they're going to get your table's waiter, then disappear and nobody shows up. they also didn't give us all of our items and we had to ask for it again. i hate to complain about service because i know it's a tough industry but they need to hire more people and the current servers just need to be faster.
the food was great - id recommend everything but the mango sticky rice, maybe its just how they serve it traditionally but the rice was really hard and hot, and the mango was half warm from the rice and it was not worth $8 at all.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adam S.,"Absolutely excellent!  The food here was quite authentic, tasted just like it did in Thailand! Best meal I've had in a while, very reasonable prices!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ved P.,"What is the hype? The food is average, the service is slow. The decor and environment is the only redeeming factor.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anindita H.,"Loved the food. Had to wait for about an hour but given it was a Friday night it was understandable. The environment is great, busy and bustling just like a Thai food joint should be. Recommend the khao soi but all the dishes are great. The green curry in a fresh coconut not only looked good but had great taste. Will come to this place again for all my Thai food cravings. Highly recommended!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jota P.,"Food, drink, atmosphere and service were all top notch.  I ordered the Khao Soi, which I believe is a house special.  I chose the braised beef.  This was one of the best Thai dishes I've ever had.  The beef was tender and tasty.  The curry sauce and noodles were so good that I saved the leftover sauce to put over rice.  And, they have a selection of fun, delicious drinks.  This is NOT really a traditional Thai resturaunt so if that's what you want, go elsewhere.  This is more of a modern Thai place.  It was packed, even on a weeknight with hip young groups and couples.  If this is your scene, this is a terrific place to catch dinner downtown.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jj W.,Loved the food. Khao soi is life! I've only had the food takeout via Ritual but it travels well and tastes flavourful and hot still,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Georgia A.,"Finally made it to this restaurant after hearing rave revues from friends.  Crowded on arrival but luckily we were seated on the patio right away.  Good choice of beverages and a course of Thai beers to try at great prices.
Service was quick and very friendly.  We ordered spring rolls to share as an appetizer for $7.00 and they were delicious.   Lovely tangy sauce for dipping and the spring rolls were nice and crispy without being too oily.
All of our mains were delicious as well. The Pad Thai was authentic and perfect heat with the ""foreigner"" spice. 
Another main ordered was the Khao Pad Thamada with chicken.  Lovely Jasmine rice with hints of oyster sauce and lime.
I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with pork.  I felt adventurous so ordered Thai spicy which notes on the menu as being the most authdntic Thai heat. I do like my food spicy so was up for the taste test.   The waitress did ask me if I was sure of the heat choice and I had to assure her it would be fine.  The pork was served over jasmine e rice and was very flavorful.  And yes the Thai heat was very spicy but very tasty if you like things hot.
The most interesting presentation was the Gaeno Kiaw Wan.  Green curry with beef.  This main arrives in a coconut with a side of jasmine rice.  The coconut adds a bit of sweetness to the curry and although the ""foreigner"" spice was ordered the coconut milk also alleviated some of the heat.
Great service, delicious food with a lot of choices.  Will certainly be back to try more dishes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eric W.,Great atmosphere and great food! Fast and friendly service. This was my first visit but it wont be my last.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lilian W.,Love this place! The best pad Thai and the Thai iced tea is a little sweet but so nice with the spicy food! Favourite Thai in the downtown area,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ernest C.,"Pai is a great restaurant for thai food. I particularly enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant - taking you out of the urban jungle of Toronto into a more quaint restaurant with small tables and a multitude of ornaments throughout the restaurant. I've had the panang curry and the pineapple fried rice, both of which were outstanding in terms of flavour and presentation. I would recommend this to friends. I have been meaning to go back, but they are often closed, and when they are open, there is often a line.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gavin K.,"Really good Thai food the place is extremely busy they should think about opening up a new restaurant. I got the classic pad Thai and it didn't disappoint, I really like that atmosphere it's pretty cool I've would definitely come back. Portion sizes werent that big the service was really good though",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ana P.,Went for lunch ... Crowded AF. Sat at the bar and got the shrimp and rice dish with a sweet sauce on the side. It was alright with the over sweet thai iced tea. Extra star for the ever smiling bartender. Food took forever to come out... Considering it was from the standard lunch menu it was a no-no.  My hungry stomach was getting upset.  Wanted the highly rated squash fries but alas it wasn't a part of the lunch menu. Would go back to check the dinner menu. Worth trying to get reservations as it seems popular with the local crowd.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rex C.,We have our company lunches here whenever we hire someone new. Everything on the menu is delicious. Get Thai Spicy.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mila Q.,Had a great first experience here. The grabong was amazing and is definitely a must try. Pad thai is also great with different levels of spice to choose from.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ellen L.,"Amazing food, great service, excellent location. My favourite dishes are the pad see ew (well-seasoned rice noodles) main and the grabong (squash fritters) appetizer. Lines can get long to get in (up to an hour) so I'd recommend making a reservation or coming on a weekday.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Irene F.,"After reading all of the amazing reviews, we were really excited to try this place during our trip to Canada. Unfortunately, it was nothing special. The appetizers were not bad but Pad Thai and other main courses were very average. When the check came and we explained that we are paying with American currency we were told that it will be the same amount. Really?!? Definitely not coming here ever again.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Colin H.,"One of my favorite authentic Thai restaurant, excellent customer service. You have to try the entree oxtail and the khoa soi, and appetizer wings and garlic shrimp.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Don S.,"Hands down our favourite Thai restaurant here in Toronto...heck, all of Canada.  Reservations sometimes tough to come by but we've had no problems if we time it bit outside the normal noon and dinner times. Today we had no reservations, small group including kids; and they graciously accommodated us in the larger private room.  Service and food were awesome as usual.  No pretension.  Just awesome and authentic food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny B.,Its just always so good.  The atmosphere is a little loud (especially if you get stuck at a shared table) and drink a little expensive for the atmosphere but for sure the best and most authentic Thai in Toronto,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Keith M.,"Very tasty, Good pad thai and northern style food. I have to say I was  little disappointed after reading such great reviews. It's worth a visit but I wasn't blown away.
Also goo prices with the portions you get.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David L.,"I think I just found my favourite thai spot in Toronto! We got the gai satay to start, which was good but could've used with one more skewer to make it worth it. The chicken wasn't too soft or too chewy- just right, and you get to pick from 2 different dips, both of which were delicious. For the main, I got the green curry and my date got the pad thai. The green curry was phenomenal but I regretted picking the fish over the tried and true chicken. While the fish was fresh, it just doesn't work that well with green curry for me. Back to the green curry though... it was amazing. Just the perfect mix of coconuty sweetness and spiciness (I chose medium spiciness). The pad thai was pretty damn good too if a little less special than the green curry. The only downside to this place is that it gets crazy busy so be sure to make reservations well ahead of time.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole P.,"Sooooo gooood. One of the best Thai restaurant I've been to. I loved every part of my experience here. I had the shredded squash fries for the starter, green curry and golden curry with egg noodle to share and everything tasted great. To my personal taste green curry was the best. It had perfect level of spice and was full of flavour. The restaurant was busy even on a Monday night, but we had no difficulty being seated. On weekend nights however finding seats will be easier with making a reservation before hand. I would definitely go back to try more food. Highly recommended",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vidhi D.,"Very good, awesome place. Will come bc. Had so much fun. Ppl very frdly. Got  my food fast, the menu is yummy",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Parkash B.,Great place. It looks small from outside but once you are you will realize how big it is.. Best thai food.. we loved the chicken in coconut curry. Chicken satay was amazing. Love the pickle and sauces they serve.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carmen L.,"The khao soi here and at Sukho Thai tastes the closest to what I had while I was in Thailand (Phuket) and brings back memories every time! Sometimes I switch it up and order Chef Nuit's pad thai if I want something lighter.
I personally find Pai and Sukhothai to be on par in terms of taste and portion for their khao soi. I just end up going to Sukho Thai more often since it's closer to my office.. but I end up at Pai if I'm closer to the Entertainment District.
Once in a while I will order their thai iced tea, but it can be overly sweet and you can't customize the sugar level since it's made in batches ahead of time. I've tried their mango and sticky rice with coconut sauce also and it's pretty good.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ly N.,"Love coming to Pai! Food is delicious and authentic. Atmosphere is unique and exciting. Service is usually pretty good!
My favourite are the chicken wings and the pad gra prow (with pork). I like to ask for a few extra slices of cucumber to go with it.
It's tricky to get a reservation, but it's definitely worth the wait!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lucifer J.,"been here twice, it is delicious. Got a weird green curry inside a young coconut shell and a bomb diggity pad thai. Good atmosphere, appropriate location for an adult date (i.e. two couples going out together so they no longer have to talk to their respective partners). 
Much Love

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,D C.,"decent food and servers were nice...music is old-school hip hop (which I liked)
uncomfortable chairs for a big table and automatic 20% gratuity added for tables over 6? hmm...this place isn't high-end, so i thought that was excessive ...for this place...I would have tipped the standard 15%, but to each his own",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kasinee K.,"Being Thai myself and live here for 5 years, so I cook a lot of my foods because there are none of the thai restaurant here i would like to dine in. I love Pad thai, I mean original street Pad Thai, and I have been searching for that almost every thai restaurant in Toronto best Pad thai reviews, none of its were really close to the true Thai taste. Finally, today my best friend convinced me to go check out this place, and it was love a first bite :) I found the place that gave me the real Pad Thai I have been looking for 5 years :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Von C.,"Food: 3/5 (would have given a 4 if we didn't get food poisoning) 
My friend and I ordered a Thai iced tea, khao soi, green curry, and mango sticky rice to share.
The green curry was ah-mazing!  I even thought it was slightly better than Khao San Roads', which I always rated as number 1. I could have eaten three bowls of rice with that, so I highly recommend it!
The khao soi with braised beef was good, but I would probably try something else next time. Felt a little ripped off with the mango sticky rice though, wasn't worth 8 bucks.
Service: 3.5/5 
Our waitress and everyone at the restaurant were really nice! However it was just sooooo incredibly slow. I assume they're still getting used to service? Or they were short-staffed, but they really need to work on that.
***Both my friend and I got food poisoning the next morning, which is unfortunate. We're 99.9% sure it was from the restaurant because we both didn't eat before or after dinner.
For the green curry.. we MIGHT give them a second chance, but it'll be a while before we go back.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tara K.,"I love the Regulars, they define Thai food in Toronto. A must try is their Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Shrimp or their Khao Soi with beef. Yummy! 
Be warned there is a very long wait of at least a half hour to over an hour, but thankfully there's a waiting area where you can order drinks while waiting for a table. Or just walk around the area and check out TIFF's gift shop! Or check out their washrooms it's so nice and there's this running video of Learning to Speak Thai. 
Very casual vibe, but in the evenings you get the after work crowd of young 30 somethings so you may feel underdressed. Not really family friendly, maybe during the day it'll be ok to bring the kids. 
They have other locations under different names, Sukhothai and Sabai Sabai. Check them out!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gail C.,"I really enjoyed this place. Great food and atmosphere. Definitely a place to go to for lunch during business hours.
If you're looking for a place that is reasonably priced in the financial/entertainment district with tasteful food, surrounded by casual diners, this is the place to eat.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lola M.,"Amazing food, terrible service ! From the beginning to the end of the meal I had to flag down different waiters for everything we needed, to order, to get water, the bill. I wanted to pay by debit and get a box for my
Leftovers so I waited and waited and eventually put cash on the table and left. I'm not even sure who was supposed to be serving us as we got the attention of someone different every time (maybe they didn't know either) I was very disappointed after reading all the good reviews. The food was very delicious, we started off with spring rolls and the squash fritters which were my favourite. Overall I would not come back because of the poor service.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matthew L.,"If I had the money, I'd eat here everyday. I try a couple new dishes each time I visit and am always pleasantly surprised. Awesome staff and a comfortable atmosphere make this one of my favourite places in the city! You won't be disappointed... but if you are, then you probably aren't human.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ms. J.,"Pai is a great Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto serving up authentic Northern Thai food.  We are great fans of the owners, and chef Nuit Regular really knows how to make addictive dishes.  Our favorite dishes are the: Pad Thai with shrimp, and Gaeng Kiaw Wan with chicken, served in a coconut husk.  The Gaeng Massaman is also a winner.  Try everything at least once, and you can then decide on your favorites.  The atmosphere at Pai is also nice and energetic.  It's a great place to go with friends and family, or for a casual or first date.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt W.,This place is terrible please don't go I hate when I have to wait for a seat. Please just avoid it like the plague I love it so much don't go plz.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carmen C.,"I had their veggie pad thai and it was really good. I went here because my go to (Khao San Road) decided to move. I would come back and try on of their curries or apps for sure! I liked their set up a little better than Khao San Road, the decor was more fun. 
Wish they would have more veggie/vegan options. Not sure if all their food, after choosing tofu as the protein, guarantees it being vegetarian. Definitely will try to remember to ask the staff.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linda K.,"So hard to reserve a table here, so instead, my friend and I popped up early Saturday morning when it first opened to grab a seat. 
We ordered the fruit shakes, which was good, but it's a lot of drink that we are unable to finish.
I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with beef and my friend ordered the Pad Thai I think. Both dishes were delicious. I ordered mine medium spicy as at Salad King that's my go to spiciness level, man, was that spicy - warning here, their spiciness is way spicier than other places. The first couple of bites I'm so glad I got the fruit shakes to help my tongue, but later on the pad gra prow got less spicy (probably since it's at the bottom and it didn't reach there).
Would definitely go back, but I'll know not to order medium next time.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David S.,"If you haven't already heard, this is the best Thai place, value for money, in the city.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rikke P.,"Excellent vibe. Ate at the bar alone, very good food and cool interior. Friendly staff",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tammi L.,Delicious food at affordable prices. The atmosphere was great. The only downfall is wait time both for seats and food.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Peter D.,Worth the wait! the bold flavors match the dark wood décor. great atmosphere and great Thai food. one of my favorite Thai spots in Toronto,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Waseemah K.,I consider Pai one of the best places for Thai food in the GTA. I got their signature pad Thai with shrimp and it's always my go to dish when I go to Pai. It never fails me because it tastes so authentic. I highly recommend this place if you love Thai food!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark S.,"Pai Thai Kitchen
                            is a great place to eat I was really surprised that the food tasted so good I am African and I only go to African and Jamaican restaurants i went out with a friend to the pain thai kitchen and I was blown away WOW the food was great and I had a great time I will be going back real soon with my wife.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Souvir B.,Tasty food. I ordered krapow. I requested Thai hot and it was a perfect balance of hot and taste. I was disappointed that for $18 the quantity of chicken was way less.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linda H.,Favourite Thai in Toronto. Crazy about their pad gra prao. I daydream about it! So good!!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sam P.,Total cheap eat hipster restaurant. The food was ok but nothing special. The staff were great but the decor really needs some work.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew G.,Unbelievable. Best Thai food I've ever had. Flavours were so good I ate most of the meal with my eyes closed so I could experience it to the max!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anita S.,Delicious food. Great cocktail menu. Vibrant. Good music. Lively. Fun atmosphere. Decently priced. Unique and authentic.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elly H.,Best Thai food in the city. Love the chicken pad thai. Long wait so make sure you reserve ahead.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicholas M.,Terrific! Super efficient staff and gloriously delicious food. I'd eat here every day if I could. A great mix with some more traditional dishes on the menu. YUM.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Harsh N.,One of the best Thai in Toronto. The ambience is amazing and the food is awesome. You can tell by the amount of waiting you gotta do to get the table on weekends. Its a must if you visit Toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Akhil M.,Awesome pad thai and peanut skewers. Sake went well with the food and servers were very cordial and nice. Highly recommend this place to seekers of good thai food in a pub like ambiance.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael M.,"I've never walked out of a restaurant without paying for a meal, so this was a first. In all my years of dining out I've never encountered worse service. The waitress looked like she's come to work without changing out of her ratty old gym clothes. There were three people in the restaurant, and it still took her 10 minutes to show up with water. 
It took her another 15 minutes to take out order and when she did , she knew exactly nothing about the food. My meal came out fairly promptly, but we waited about 20 minutes for my friend's. In that time she disappeared into the washroom with cleaning stuff which... GROSS! 
And when someone finally came by to check on us (as we were putting out coats on) we discovered that despite the 5 minute conversation she had with my friend about his order, she hadn't bothered to actually place it. Yep, she thought 2 grown men were going to eat one entree, I guess. 
Nothing would ever get me to set foot in that place again if for no other reason then watching my waitress prep to clean a toilet was completely disgusting.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sujan S.,"All of their dishes are fantastic, you really can't go wrong here! It's so good that there's typically an hourlong wait to get a table, but it's well worth it. The green curry (served in a coconut!) and pad thai are their popular dishes, and I'd agree that they should tried first. However, my favourites were the shrimp soup (Tom Yum Nam Sai Kung Mor Fai) and the egg noodles in a golden curry (Khao Soi). Beware of the ""Thai Spicy"" heat level, even for someone who loves spice it was quite overwhelming. ""Foreigner Spicy"" is a perfect level of heat that goes with any of their dishes. Can't wait to go back!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,D S.,"A different take on the standard Thai food we've all come to love. Northern Thai is an appropriate description as there is certainly crossover with Burmese cuisine. Saw some veggies go to another table- so we asked for the same. Marigold. Nice crunch and nice to have veggies with all the carbs we've been eating lately. Coconut water was fresh. Didn't have any of the mixed fruity drinks, but they certainly looked delicious if you are in the mood for that. The place has a fun tropical dive bar atmosphere - good for happy hour or a night out!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linda ..,Loved it. The food always tastes very delicious. The place gets very crowded of course. Be prepared to wait in lines.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt S.,"This was my second time visiting this place, both were because my favourite Thai restaurant nearby was closed. 
It's at a nice location in a half basement, restaurant decor were trendy and pleasing.
We sat by the windows, one huge issue was that the bench was too high and the table was too low for the person sitting on the bench. The position of your food is where your stomach is, so you really have to bend down to eat, which was a bit awkward for my gf, and she's not tall, only about 5'5. The chairs were of okay height.
I had the Gaeng Masaman with braised beef while my gf had the Khao Soi. Both were okay and nothing spectacular. Both dishes had good flavour, however, the braised beef were dry even with all the curry. Typically you should use beef brisket or shank for this dish, but they didn't, there were zero fat or tendon among the meat, which made it very dry and hard to chew. The Khao soi rather salty, and the crispy noodles turned soggy really quickly, after that it was pretty inedible. Try the real Khao soi with braised beef at Khan san road and you'll taste the difference.
Overall:
+location
+service
+interior decor
-food quality
-above average price
-forced 20% gratuity for parties of 8 or more (I wasn't forced to pay this as it was just 2 people, but I find this to be above average for a Thai restaurant as well)",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,C L.,Pai is one of my go-to restaurants. The food is consistently delicious and prices are reasonable. My favourite dish is the pad gra pow - flavourful and satisfying. Go early to avoid the crowds.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Smic C.,"Great, Thai food at a reasonable price. Ambiance is fun and exciting but not too loud. Probably not the best for large groups because it can be crowded.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacinta K.,The green curry from this restaurant is fantastic. I have only ever had take out but I trust it is amazing. every time we try to go here it is at least a 1 hour wait time so we give up:) but take out is amazing!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matt S.,Picked up chicken Pad Thai for lunch once. It was very good. The place was very big inside and it was packed for lunch. I would love to come back and try more food.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Luis C.,Ordered a Tom Yum soup and it was luke warm. I asked to reheat the soup but it was still luke warm - very disappointed. Service was slow as well and not attentive. Came with a group of 7 people and they charged us a service fee of 20%. Not recommended.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah G.,"We ate here last week, and I was very pleased! I ordered the pad thai, and it was fresh and not too greasy. I don't normally feel good after eating greasy food, and usually pad thai is greasy, but this wasn't . My friend had a beef noodle soup, and she loved it as well! 
I loved the food decor! Some of the plates/cups looked like hand-made wood, and it was totally a thai atmosphere. Definitely will go again!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenna S.,"The green curry was killer, rich herbal goodness and creamy coconut milk. I did it with ""foreigner's level"" of spice as did my friend with his Khao Soi but both were mild to our tastebuds. I would not hesitate to order my food Thai spicy here!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sharon L.,"Line up: abandoned; 30 mins to check in, once checked in, another 20 mins. Mind you it was on Friday at 7pm on a TIFF night. Appetizers to give to guests waiting in line as they do at KhaoSan could be helpful to curb the hunger and would result in less people leaving. There were two couples, 1 ahead and 1 behind us who abandoned. 2 star
Food: flavours were fragrant and bold, spice level was as requested, temperature warm to hot, fried squash was crispy, wine was palatable, no dessert because we were two and could not finish what we ordered: 1 fried squash, 1 green chicken curry in coconut, 1 red curry with beef (khao soi) - not enough beef and definitely not enough noodles in the latter. Khao soi was a soupy curry. 4 star
Atmosphere: like what my friends' basements looked like when we hung out, but cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing. Good music, liked the vinyls on the walls. 5 star
Value: $80 with tax and tip for two (we did get a glass of wine each). 3 star 
Overall I would give this place 14/20.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lindsay H.,"Came here on a Tuesday around 3 for a late lunch. We were seated right away since we were a party of two. Service was normal at the beginning, but after we received our meals we never saw our server again. Not sure if he was off duty and whoever took over our table forgot about us or what. Safe to say I was disappointed with the service. Waited for 35 minutes after we were finished eating and we had to ask someone who was cleaning empty tables nearby to take our plates and bring our bill since no one acknowledged us. It was busy but not too busy where we would have been forgotten about. Thank goodness the food was tasty. We ordered the khao soi and the green curry",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Candi W.,"I've been to all of Regular's restaurants in Toronto, and this is by far my favourite. I always order either their pad thai and grilled pork with sticky rice on the side. Atmosphere is nice and I enjoy its decor. That took me long enough to write a review! I've already been here at least 3 times this year alone and it's only April!
I remember the first time I went last year. I heard a tweet as my friend poured water, and we thought we were hearing things. Eventually we figured out it's the bottle! How cute and amusing. I highly recommend this place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle H.,"Best Thai joint downtown. Ton of variety. My favourite dishes would be the pad thai and the khao soi - very smooth and rich. I came here for my friends birthday, you are able to book big groups however you must book in advance. Great atmosphere, even has a TV in the private rooms. Definitely a must try thai place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie O.,"I came to Canada for my first time because of a wedding and found a single reason to return to Toronto for the best Thai food I've ever had! Pai Thai delivered beyond expectation! The green curry, fried rice, egg noodle dish, beef salad and mango sticky rice all excellent!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ron F.,I've never had a dish at this place that I didn't absolutely love!  I've been to A LOT of thai restaurants and this is definitely the best!  Service and decor is great too!  Very busy though so get there early or make a reservation VERY EARLY!  It gets booked up many days in advance.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kyle F.,This place was fucking off the hook! Everything on the menu is so good! Omg. The curry is fantastic. The rice is fantastic. I also got the apps. It was sooooo good!!! Omg. Would recommend,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle E.,Great service and food. The sangria was excellent and the pad Thai was unbelievable   I would come back!!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Barbara Y.,"Very delicious Thai food in the heart of Toronto. And judging by the huge crowds always here, we're not the only ones who think so!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dasiga S.,"Great food, amazing ambience. Ordered Pad Thai and their green curry and it was delicious. Definitely on par with Khao San Road, although Pai has better presentation and way more seating.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gary B.,"Have been to a lot of Thai restaurants through the years, and this one rates as one of the best. The fried rice has that well seasoned wok flavor. The green curry was rich and deep in flavor. The only thing that disappointed was that they don't have a fresh spring roll option. Don't miss this restaurant if you're only here for a few days!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tyler S.,"My favourite Thai place to go. Great staff, great atmosphere, great drinks and great food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marisa N.,The food is delicious at Pai. The price point is a bit higher for Thai food however the quality is consistent. The fried chicken as an app is a must with the fried lemongrass and their chilli dipping sauce! Talking about it is making me hungry.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenn C.,"I went to Pai with a group of six on one of the nights where TIFF was happening. As you can imagine, there were tons of people outside in line for the TIFF events. Fortunately we didn't have to wait long to be seated. We immediately ordered the Tom Yum Soup and Grabong. The soup actually wan's too memorable to me but the Grabong, which is this deep fried batter squash dish was amazing. I don't know if it was just that our group was super hungry, but we finished it so quickly that we ordered seconds right away. The garlic dip with the grabong was goodness in my mouth =) Would definitely get that every time I go. 
For my main I got the Pad Thai. This tasted super good and flavourful and out of all the places I have had pad thai at, this is definitely at the top. 
Most of us also got the Gaeng Kiaw Wan, which is the green curry. The rice actually came in a coconut so that was quite interesting. Based on their responses, it seemed that the dish was well enjoyed.
Server was very nice and overall, food came pretty quickly. Pretty noisy environment though so would recommend for gathering and casual dinner nights. Overall, would definitely come again!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Oluwaseyi A.,"One of my new favourite Thai restaurants to date. Wish I had time to try out the dinner menu while I was in town but the lunch menu was great as well. Arrived late afternoon Friday to avoid some of the wait which worked in our favour. We only waited about 10-15mins for a table which is nothing for a very popular restaurant. Wait staff was friendly. The food was worth it. The Kung Tawt starter was amazing! Cooked to perfection. The main, the traditional Khao Soi was awesome and even better with the added pepper oil. Instead of dessert I opted for a drink, the plum mule, which was refreshing. It was the first stop on our visit to Toronto and it did not disappoint.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marcus L.,"A bustling joint situated in a central area downtown, this place is well-attended, often with lengthy waits during peak meal times. Came here with a friend on a Tuesday night at around 6, and the wait turned out to be 20 minutes or so. Inside the restaurant is loud, with tables arranged close to each other.
My friend ordered the khao soi and I got their pad thai. Their serving size was quite generous, and compared to the other places in the area was very good for its $15 a dish price tag. From what I tasted, PAI does a good job delivering deep flavours with rich spices, but personally I would have liked to see them add a bit more of a kick to it.
Only gripe about this place would probably be the noise level, as the low ceilings, loud music, and packed arrangement made it very difficult to speak over the crowd. If I were in the area and were craving southeast-asian cuisine, would probably come back.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Namir S.,"I appreciate the variety offered, but in terms of taste, the dishes I had were solidly average. spring rolls, Pad Thai, curry chicken, sticky rice. None stood out, really.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nikita H.,"Probably the best Thai food I have had, outside of Thailand. Busy place, but worth the wait. Food was excellent!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,N G.,"Excellent dinner at Pai! Wonderful service and ambience and the food was delicious, would highly recommend, great for takeout as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara K.,Amazing Thai food! So far the best one I tried in Toronto. Khao Soi chicken is my favorite dish. Tom Yum soup is one the best... Make sure to try it.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashwini T.,"THE BEST THAI FOOD I've every had in North America!! Don't forget to have their wings, and their Tom Yum soup. It's outta this world! I would do a 4 hours drive to Toronto only to eat at PAI!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ruby S.,we loved this place on our visit to toronto. amazing food and great drinks. awesome ambiance,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jorge L.,"Pai is great for takeout lunch. Quantities are adequate, enough to share or have two meals. If you're in the area consider ordering from them. Service was really attentive, and the place looks casual and cozy. Good for casual lunches and maybe dinner before a movie (really close to the theatre).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rhea M.,"There was a 40 minute wait for a table and we ended up sitting at the bar. We had no complaints. Great sake deal and the green curry was delectable! I love thai food and this was toward the top of the list for curries in my book! Kind service even though they were quite busy, and the atmosphere was great. I felt like I was really on vacation! I definitely recommend this place to those who love thai in Toronto!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nabeela H.,"Love it! The ambience, the food, everything. If you're a Toronto downtown native, you have heard of this place. One must try appetizer are the squash fritters. Most dishes are tasty but my favourite is the fish panang fish curry (fish filets cooked in a panang sauce) as this dish is only available and cooked well in a select few Thai restaurants.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rose D.,"Had the sweet potato appetizer and that came with an dipping sauce and both were awesome.  Also had the Panang Curry with shrimp & rice.  I found it a touch on the sweet side but still had good flavour. My friends both ordered the Pad Thai and I tried it and found it to be very good.  Next time I go, I would opt to have the Pad Thai instead.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Keira H.,"Best Thai ever. You can order on the Maegan app; easier than getting a table and tastes just as good. I could eat their food ice cold it's delicious.
Favourite restaurant in To!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Taylor W.,Honestly pretty disappointed. Both times I've had pai the girl I spoke to on the phone was rude to me. The food isn't bad but didn't meet my expectations and it's overpriced compared to other Thai food in the city. Won't go back.,2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,H C.,Amazing !!! Love the butternut squash and the Panang Curry. A must if you love Thai!!!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia L.,"Pai serves food that warms the soul and plays music that makes you want to dance. I really loved the ""bumpin'"" atmosphere and how friendly the servers were. The food was also topnotch and authentic. Morning glory was a great starter, followed by the green curry. I'd return here in a heartbeat.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Heather O.,We went here after the auto show and and was very lucky to get a table since it was 5 of us. Great food friendly staff and very knowledgeable in regards to the menu. We will be back.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Virginia B.,"Very delicious Thai food. Love the atmosphere, very chill and cozy. I went by myself at lunch time and wasn't intimidated at all. Sat at the bar, and the waiters/bartenders were all very friendly and made me feel welcome. I got the starter Tom yum soup which is amazing, just be warned it is quite spicy. Then I got the veggie pad Thai which was one of the best ones I've had. Will definitely be going back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Denise D.,"We went here based solely on Yelp reviews. I was in Toronto with my son looking at Universities and given the fabulous choices that Toronto has to offer, we weren't stuck for choice. We came on a weekday around 5:30, and there was a short 15 minute wait. I got a fabulous frozen cocktail that was served in a pineapple; delish! So good I had to have another .  The vibe was young and hip and there was a great atmosphere. The food was every bit as good as everyone said; my son's pad Thai was super fresh and flavorful, with the right hint of lime. My noodle dish was so good; served in a bowl and kind of a cross between a soup and a dish... You could tell the ingredients were fresh and good quality. If I lived anywhere near this place I would be there all the time!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tam L.,"At the encouragement of one of our group members, my 5 friends and I decided to hold our exchange reunion at Pai, as opposed to another popular Thai restaurant (hint: it starts with a K and ends in Road; y'all know who I'm talking about). 
The wait was a reasonable hour for a party of 6 that arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday evening (reservations were booked at least one week out) because they allow you to put your name down and go your merry way until your table is ready. 
The ambiance is hip and reminds you of the hostel you wish you stayed at in Thailand. The server was friendly and helpful with the recommendations. 
I got the beef Pad Gra Prow (mild because I'm a baby). It consists of spiced ground beef over rice and topped with a fried egg. The spice level was just right--spicier than I expected for mild, which is great because it pushed me and when combined with the taste of holy basil reminded me that I was eating Thai food and shouldn't be such a baby. The yolk was perfectly runny and when punctured provides the fat and flavor needed to mellow out and complement the ground beef while dialing up the flavor of the jasmine rice. The only mistake was a user error: I thought it was a great idea to pour all my chili infused fish sauce over my dish halfway and was left with something that was too soggy and too spicy to enjoy. I guess if you like a wetter, spicier rice dish, go for it, but I was pretty sad that like Freddie Prinze, Jr. in 90's classic She's All That when the nerdy girl discovered that she was a bet and gets mad at him, I ruined a very good thing.
Ok now for the real reason I'm even writing this review: the Thai Iced Tea. So I'm kind of a Thai Iced Tea (or cha yen if you're being pretentious) conosseiur; I mean it was 50% of the reason I visited Thailand...ok 60%. This one is nice because it's served over a glass full of crushed ice. The tea is also stronger than your usual Thai Iced Tea, which is great because then the overall drink is not overpowered by the sweetness of the condensed milk. 
TLDR: Make reservations at least 2 weeks in advanced. If you absolutely cannot stand spice, ask for no spice. Get the Thai Iced Tea if you're into that kind of thing.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eatomaniac L.,I am a regular patron here and have introduced many friends and family to Pai. Always delicious and always great service!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alan M.,Arrive early or be prepared to wait!  Totally worth it though.  Tasty authentic dishes and interesting cocktails.   Highly recommended.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Larah O.,Excellent place! Can't complain about anything on the menu. Restaurant itself is an experience. The staff is really friendly. Try and get a seat at the bar. The bar tenders are great dinner company. Pad grow prow is my favourite main dish on the menu. Squash fritters are a must!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Malak M.,Quite average in terms of flavors and variety.. Service was friendly and fast but the food was just MEH.. We ordered the spring rolls and fried squash for starters and went for the Khao Soi and pad Thai as main dish.. We weren't too impressed and we kept reminiscing about Khao San! It's ok but not as good as Khao San used to be!,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kit C.,"Another great Thai place in Toronto, if not my favourite. Their Squash Fritters are excellent and the Pad Gra Prow is another very tasty dish with stir fried ground beef on top of jasmine rice plus a fried egg on top. Great atmosphere for a group - loud, fun and always busy. Another long wait though, so best to go during off-peak hours.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Allie Y.,"3.5 stars (wish there were half star ratings!).  I've been several times over the years and they're just okay in terms of food and service.  Nothing bad and maybe just my dishes.  However, I don't like the loud room, as it seems to echo and makes it difficult to converse.  I use to work nearby and after being horrified that my boss was planning on ordering Thai catered food for our entire office of 60 people from the food court, I suggested Pai and colleagues seemed to love the food.  LOL. My boss only complained about the delivery system that can only be done online, which seemed like a third party that sucked and it doesn't have all dishes available either.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin W.,"I've been to Pai a few times, and haven't had the greatest experiences.  It is often quite busy, and the lineups do take some time (it's good they take reservations now).  Unfortunately, the first time, my friend and I got sick from the food.  The second time was with a few friends, and we ordered the Khao Soi, Pad Thai Bangkok, and a few other dishes.  It was ok - but we do find that there are other authentic Thai places in the area that are better.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Giselle S.,Very flavourful food with interesting presentation.  Reasonable prices but serving size is on the smaller side.  Great place for pre theatre dinner but they are really busy and the kitchen can be slow getting out the plates because they are working on take out orders at the same time.  Service was efficient but be sure you let them know you have to be out in time for the theatre.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katie A.,"Came here for dinner last week and the food was really yummy.  I ordered the pad Thai with tofu and veggies, medium spicy. Other than the waitress' recommendation that medium was going to be very spicy (it was actually quite mild), I'd say everything was perfect!  Service was quick after being seated (we were told we'd have an hour wait, which ended up only being 35min - yay!), great ambiance for a casual dinner. Will definitely be back and look forward to trying more things!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maria S.,"The place is vibrant and flagrant. The muffled discussions blended with the smell of coconut milk and wine makes me want to stay there forever. The food is delicious. But as is most often the case, when you are too reputed you tend to cut down your portions! A year before, I could be full with a green curry chicken with rice and now I need two. But still worth the experience. I will not recommend for take-out though. For me the experience in that surreal basement trumps everything else. Worth taking a first date.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grace T.,"With the previous reviews, we had high expectations but were disappointed.  The pad thai was very sweet.  The tom yum soup was very salty.  The chicken curry was ok.  We drank alot of water after this meal.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jiawei L.,Cool place for thai food. Used to love their pad thai but felt their food quality was getting lower so I rarely go there now.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Grant M.,Staff (especially Emilie) and food were a great combo. I've lived in Thaland long enough to know a great Thai retardant.  I didn't think a restaurant of this size would have the authenticity.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Krista S.,"Pai is one of the best Thai food places I've been to in Canada. The Gaeng Kiaw Wan (green curry) is fantastic and comes in a fresh coconut! The mango sticky rice for dessert is also phenomenal; however, the last time we ordered it it was the end of the night and I think I had been made earlier in the day as it was quite dry and not at all warm.
Overall, the food is always fresh and the service is always efficient and courteous.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Geq P.,"When visiting a city for the first time, I usually like to have cuisine that is native to the place I'm visiting for the first and last meals of the stay. However, Toronto is one of those places where anything ethnic could be considered ""homegrown"", and so Pai was where I went first. I stopped here shortly after it opened on Good Friday, just glad to find someplace other than a nice person's kitchen to eat at, given that most restaraunts had signs reading, ""SEE YOU NEXT WEEK!"" Really, for Easter?  I digress. Pai was busy and by the time I left, was getting crowded. I ordered the Pad Grow Pa w/ shrimp. So good!!The flavors were OohWee and the spice level was spot on, with just enough kick, but sparing the linings of my cheeks. My only awould be the portion size in relation to the price. In the U.S., that dish would easily be $3-5 less. Nonetheless, if it didn't involve crossing the border to visit here, I'd definitely be a regular on those days that I felt like splurging. 5 stars for food and service, minus one for value.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,HM R.,Love it!! If you want Thai food like it's made in Thailand come here. Not pricey.  Nice ambience.  Loved the squash fritters!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia M.,"One of the best Thai restaurants in the city. The food is authentic and the decor is cheeky and playful. A great option for dinner before a musical, as the Mirvish theatres are right down the street",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David P.,This is unquestionably the best thai food in Toronto. Great scene too. Every single dish on the menu is fantastic.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kavita M.,"Excellent food , very poor service . The server took forever to come to serve , was hard to even get water .",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dennis T.,"For food alone, this place deserves five stars. Their dishes are large, flavourful, and highly varied. Their chicken Khai Soi is one of the best Thai curries in Toronto. Inside, the place is very crammed, loud, busy, and the service is not able to keep up with demand. Best advice would be to go at more atypical meal times (eg. mid-afternoon) to avoid the madness.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Peter P.,The best Thai food we've ever had!! Portion sizes are quite large so look to share if possible. Great atmosphere in a downstairs location. Probably our favorite meal while visiting Toronto!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Helen X.,"Food are very tasty but also very expensive. Spend a long time in line, also, you need to wait for a long time for the food to come. I have been there a couple times and their food were just warmish most of the time",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle T.,"This place gets super packed! Make sure to make reservations. I love their garbong, pad Thai, and of course their Khao soi. The vibe is loud and dark, sort of hard to have a conversation.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joe D.,"It was good, went for dinner one day and lunch the next. Both times with diffrent people and everyone seemed to like it both times.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Souhady D.,"Don't eat here. Food and service is horrible. We ordered 8 plates and none of them were any good, not only that but plates arrived on the table stone cold. The rice dishes tasted like they were cooked days ago, and the curries had grease floating on the top of them. We seriously left this place with the dishes untouched and when we told our waiter we were ready for the bill and no we didn't want to pack anything up to go he asked why and I told him honestly for the wait and the hype we didn't really like it and explained other things about the crappy service to him and he just said ""oh well, I heard enough complaining today"" and gave us the bill in full, when I was going to pay I told him wow your answer was rude I should have complained to a manager long ago he said ""I am the manager"" I don't know if he was saying the truth but oh boy, what a shame.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sunitha R.,"Love this place! The ambiance and food is always a hit! The service can use some sprucing up. I'm vegetarian and so there's usually less options anywhere I go, but they've offered to make dishes vegan a couple a times which I appreciate very much!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marco R.,The decor and plates reminded me of my grandparents place growing up.  Amazing space and music.  Food wise it's really good... comfort food at its best. I always get the khao soi  smoothness  and intense flavor marrying into one amazing dish and add to it amazing texture.  Also you should get Thai iced tea it's a must.  I'm giving it 5 stars maybe because it reminds me of my childhood... and that's good enough reason.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bam F.,AMAZING thai food in a trendy bar basement setting!!! And great sangria too.......just be prepared to wait unless you have reservations. It's always jam packed...........another good sign for sure.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Linda N.,"My go to rice dish is the pad gra prow and I make sure to order it every time. It's always busy at Pai, you have to make sure you make reservations or if you're going during the lunch rush to be there before noon. The last time I was there we waited 30 minutes for our food to come out but that's to be expected. I frequently order on ubereats to skip the line! Food is delicious!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christopher L.,"In Toronto for the day and hit this place based solely on the Yelp rating. Absolute score. It's northern Thai, in a street cafe style setting. The dishes were perfectly seasoned and flavorful set apart from standard Thai restaurants you find in the west. Prices are good and the atmosphere is the perfect compliment. A must when visiting Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Peaches S.,"UHMAZING ! This place was recommended by a friend but we couldn't get reservations at first so we went elsewhere (had I only known what I was missing ) Good enough when my sister came for a visit we got a table for 2pm lunch (they're that good it's always packed) . I loved it!! So when the BF and I  knew we were going to be in the area,  I made sure to reserve and book online. Much to my dismay it was fully booked! Even with alternatives I gave this place another shot. Tried to walk in and got lucky, a table for two with no wait time !! (5:30pm) woooohooo ! the place was starting to fill up but I didn't mind being Squeezed in a table by the corner . The BF and I LOVED IT! The food was full of flavour and tasty !! We split the Grabong (squash fritters) , Pad Gra Pow with the crispy pork, the Pad Thai, and dessert (there's only one). Everything and I mean every dish was delicious !  We went to watch a musical but this for me was part of the highlight of our evening. Definitely a Must to try and even a staple on my food list. Not cheap but not super expensive either . We paid $60 between two people but we were full up to the next day. Talk about stuffing ourselves. Did I say I love it ??! Ummmmm uhmmm  daydreaming about each dish all over again.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Priyesh M.,"I love this place! The food, the atmosphere and the staff! EVERYTHING I have had on this menu is delicious! I am a constant regular and continue to recommend this place! So damn good!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lindsay T.,"Amazing thai food! I will keep going back here for sure. There is a fun atmosphere, and the line moves quickly.  The servers are very friendly.  I got the Braised Beef Khao Soi (egg noodles and golden curry) and I got a side of jasmine rice to mix with the remaining curry (I had enough food to last for two dinners this way!).  Kind of expensive, but worth going to for a fun thai experience!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chelsey F.,"I really enjoyed the Pad Thai. They can make almost any order vegan, which was a really nice option! My boyfriend had the Khao Soi with beef and said it was too heavy and left him feeling very bloated after. It has a really fun vibe, nice music playing, and a nice bar. Good prices.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rory A.,"Top-notch Thai
Came in during dinner time and there was a pretty good sign-in line, but it moves quickly. There's all sorts of interesting things to look at on the walls, so it goes fast. I got lucky with a place at the bar right away but most groups were waiting about 30 min. 
This place has a great vibe and the staff was very friendly. 
I'm a huge fan of Tom Yum soup, but I really wanted to try the Pad Gra Prow that everyone's talking about and some wings. Luckily, they have an appetizer size bowl of Tom Yum. I'm so happy I got it. It's easily the best Tom Yum I've ever had. Bold lemongrass flavor, as expected, but there's something else in there that gives it a very savory, almost hearty, feeling broth. Almost like there's a dash of tomato soup mixed in. It's so good. I almost ordered another bowl of it, but my other food came out.
Wings were very good. They were cooked perfectly and had a very nice thin crispy layer on them. Presentation was very nice too.
I've never had Pad Gra Pow before and I'm now sad about that fact. It was awesome! I will agree that it seems to be on the small side, but as I finished it, I realized that it was just enough. I got it with ground pork. Really great flavor! I didn't leave a single morsel on the plate. The egg on top was perfectly done too.
This place is on my list if I ever come back to Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hiba A.,"The famous Pai! While wait times have been a smidgen lengthy every time I've eaten dinner here, the food and service has always been consistently great. As far as Thai food in the city goes, I definitely recommend Pai.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark L.,"I like the rustic decor and the food is pretty good. Price is reasonable and portions are good too.
It gets really busy during dinner time, so try to arrive early - although they have a waiting bar area luckily. 
It gets fairly loud in there, but that's just the type of place it is, bustling modern place.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nick S.,"Delicious meals, very well priced for lunch. The decor is fun and the waitstaff are friendly. Highly recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Salmaan A.,"Everything about this place was on point! The vibe, the quirky decor, the music selection and most importantly the food! The Khao Soi was incredible and was definitely worth missing my flight home to Chicago. Pad Thai - bomb. Thai Iced Tea - bomb. Definitely the best Thai spot I've been to.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Wendy C.,"Had the green curry for lunch, called ahead for take out. It was ready when I got there and just opening the container was bliss. It was so fresh and so good that I went to heaven for a little bit. Please go. Everyone I know that goes, loves it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex T.,"This review will be shorter than my first two. I came here in May. I came here at 11:30am and beat the lunch rush, which at the time became a line out the door.
Food was delicious. Decor is amazing. Drinks are good. My one issue with this place is that they rush rush rush you out the door. I was doing a business meeting lunch so I didn't appreciate this. 
Normally I value service, comfort higher and being rushed would have resulted in a 1.5 to 2 star loss, but the food was delicious so I can't be too harsh.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paras S.,Very cool ambience. The food is also very good. We reached there at 4pm for a late lunch on Saturday and the place was packed.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David G.,"Get the sake bombs from here. Always great and super good.  They have the raptors named drinks. I like the cucumber one which is 2oz of gin in there.
Pros
Good pad thai
Nice night market at the end of the month
Cons 
gets busy but you can book and they'll text you when ready!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacob G.,"Craving authentic Thai food that's not just Pad Thai? Looking for a place to try some amazing cocktails while trying amazing food? Well Pai is your place then! Decided to go here during the holiday season so as expected it was busy. I'd definitely recommend getting reservations or even trying and calling in an hour before you want to eat to just get your name on the waiting list. They have a system where they can text you when the table is ready so that's definitely helpful. The wait time for us (group of 6) was about 50 mins to an hour. While waiting, we decided to explore their drink menu. Pai has a great selection of cocktails with a bunch dedicated to the Toronto Raptors so being the Raptors fan I am, I had to try one and it was amazing. I got the JV12 which was their take on a mojito. For appetizers, we initially tried to get the Miang Kung but they were all out of it. Then we decided to get the Kung Tawt Samoon Prai, which then we were told was not available as well. We finally settled for the cocktail shrimp but I should it was mediocre with nothing special. For the main dishes, we tried the Chef Nuit Pad Thai and the Khao Pad Thamada. The flavour on both of the dishes were amazing but in terms of quantity, my partner and I could've gone for another plate. So if you're looking for large quantity over amazing quality, then you will be disappointed. We both got the Farang Spicy and I should say it just tickled my taste buds and I could've definitely gone for the Phet Mak Mak. The quality of service was average to fair with nothing exceptional with a lot of room for improvement. The hostess did not seem like she was having a great day and our server seemed a little unorganized at times.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mikaela B.,Tried this place last night- we are on vacation in Toronto from the States. It was really packed when we arrived at 6 pm. But- we got in right away to the Thai seating. The fried squash with tamarind sauce was very good and very unique- I've never seen that anywhere else. I ordered the Pad Thai- it was very good. I've had comparable in the States- but nonetheless it was delicious. I got foreigner spicy- I could have done Thai spicy. I would recommend this place- I've heard it is advantageous to make reservations and I would agree. I think we got lucky to get seated so quickly.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carlos M.,"Wonderful ambience as if we are in a Thai shack! The food is on point. they have fun twists on Moscow mule which are nice drinks. Drinks are in the $10-13 range. Food is delicious as well. Service was fairly good too. Overall, quite happy with our experience. Note that this was midday on a weekday and the restaurant was fairly empty. Bathrooms are clean enough.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daljit S.,I love Thai food. Their recopies are really filled with taste and prices are also affordable. I love to there with friends and family.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie S.,"Best Thai I ever had!!! The appetizers are generous and super tasty...the green curry in the coconut shelf...I could have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,W C.,"This is the best Thai place that i know of in TO.  The competition (Sukhothai, KSR) just doesn't measure up.  There is more balance here in the flavours and the menu and drinks offerings are crowd pleasing -this is a great place to have a casual meal with a group of friends.  OK, the music and noise can get too loud in some parts of the restaurant, but hey, that just lends to its authenticity.  Service is friendly and snappy.  This place can get super busy with long line ups so plan ahead.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kim T.,"This place is very busy, and it is busy for a reason. The ambiance is nice and the food is affordable and delicious. I love the Crispy Basa Fillet dish. The sauce is fantastic! I am not a fan of curry and I actually enjoyed the Khao soi dish (Fresh egg noodles in golden curry) I will definitely go back and recommend it to my friends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christy C.,"Waited in line for half hour here and khao San road, tried both Thai restaurant within 24 hours while visiting Toronto. Pai definitely beat khao San road!    
Khao San road is good, Pai is GREAT!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pemma T.,"Finally tried Pai. Went there on a Friday night after seeing how long the lines were at Khao San Road... Pai had a line up too, but it moved pretty fast. 
We ordered the Papaya Salad, Pad Thai and the Massaman curry. Everything lived up to the hype, but what really stood out for me was the som tum.. the portion is tiinnny, but it is SO damn delicious, I wish they'd serve a bigger portion of it so I could make a meal of just the salad. 
Also, their drink made with gin, lychee juice, mint and a bunch of other stuff is the perfect summer cocktail.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tim C.,Got the Pad Thai to go because it was a packed house with a hour wait on a Wednesday evening. It wasn't to die for but I blame part of it on the fact that I got it to go. Definitely going to try eating in when I get the chance.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lauren P.,"My fave Thai in the city! I've tried everything on the menu and nothing disappoints! Personally favourites are the Tom Yum soup - so incredibly flavourful and very spicy. The chicken panang curry - tasty, thicker red pepper based curry and of course, the pad Thai!!! Prices have gone up recently however it's still reasonable and just as delicious!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nancy J.,"Nice environment, great-tasting food, although the selection is quite limited.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pylin C.,New favorite Thai place and I'm originally from Thailand! I used to go to Khao San road but come here now because 1) takes reservations (I hosted my birthday party there for 15 ppl and they have a private section in the back and they work with you to figure out the menu and service was great) and 2) the food is better! The pad Thai here was surprising great compared to Khao sarn road and my cousin who just came from Thailand approved. Same for the som tum with salted crabs like that's one of my favorite street thai dishes but the problem with eating it in Thailand is the crabs might have parasites so I don't really eat it there but there's no parasites in these crabs here obviously! They also have sticky rice here and always present the food so wonderfully. Love their pad kraprao too but sometimes too spicy than I can handle bcos I have been in Canada for too long. But still good! Service is pretty good but they're always really busy so it's a tiny bit slow but if you call them they come over. They also host a bunch of parties throughout the year so if I lived in Toronto I would totally go!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily P.,Amazing food!! The green curry and pad Thai was amazing!!! Great ambiance also and the place is a lot bigger than you think. Staff was friendly! Love the sticky rice as well.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,AP S.,Absolutely loved the food. My party ordered a bunch of things but the Khao Soi was the best. The squash fries were a great appetizer as well.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,benantha n.,"Went here yesterday on a double date.  Since we had kids we don't get out much so when we do we try to go to places that have had good ratings.  The food is different then other Thai restaurants.  The presentation of the food was very appealing.   We tried a couple of appetizers, mains and dessert.  I would say the food was average.  Nothing that made me go ""wow"" but it was good.  The service was excellent.  Usually at restaurants you have a dedicated one server, however with pai - you do with one serve but every serve was happy to help us get stuff or answer any questions we had.   Thank goodness we made reservations,  the line up was crazy.   For the duration that we were there it never died down.  The place actually looks and feels like a bar in Thailand that catered to foreigners reminds me of my vacations in Thailand.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christian S.,"I eat Thai food every Thursday. It's a ritual - like pizza on Fridays. Last night, visiting family in Toronto, we went for Thai food. We tried the green curry served in a coconut, the house pad Thai, and the chicken satay. THIS WAS THE BEST THAI FOOD I HAVE EVER EATEN. If you're the type of person that just TOLERATES Thai food, you have to go to Pai. You will then be a fan of Thai food. I'll be going back before I leave Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria W.,"Pai is a great place for lunch on a workday. You'll need to go early if you want to walk in. The food is delicious and the service is pretty good. 
Went here for dinner one time and was a little disappointed. The prices were significantly higher and the quality of the food didn't seem quite as good as the lunch service. Could have been a one off problem though.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie L.,"Literally in LOVE with this place.  If you're looking for a great thai place to eat at, you've come to the right place.  I swung by here a few times and it's always been enjoyable.
First off, the service/atmosphere is great.  They're very friendly and if you've got questions they answer you politely.  Overall the restaurant is clean it's sort of got a bar like feel so it's definitely a social spot.  Just expect a ton of people to be there though, depending on the hours you might have to wait a while if you've got a few people.  If it's just for two you can find yourself a seat in no time.
Secondly, the food.  The appetizers seem pretty standard but I like the sausages, it's different depending on you obviously but it's a personal favourite of mine; nothing like your average sausage from the supermarket obviously but the spices and how it's served with the sauce is delicious.  Getting to main dishes I'd really just pick the curry.  Don't get me wrong everything is good but if you're coming for the first time I'd pick the curry.  There's a ton of options but I end up coming back for the coconut green curry.  I'm very sensitive to spicy food yet curry is still one of my favourite dishes, at PAI you get to pick how spicy you want it to be (I obviously went mild since I'm a wimp with spice) you can choose it to have no spice or REALLY spicy.  The coconut green curry is delightful since your curry literally comes in a coconut, it's fun to scrape out the inside of the coconut while eating the green curry.  The rice surprisingly holds well with the curry and the texture of the curry isn't overly thick but isn't watery either.  It's well balanced and  I end up cleaning up the plate every time.  My friends and I also like the pad thai here too, noodles are cooked perfectly and it's slightly chewy without a good amount of peanuts on there.  
I could rant all day about why I keep coming back but it's really the best thai restaurant that comes closest to matching the food I ate in Thailand.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kristine C.,"oyster mushroom (vegan) with purple rice was delicious! I also enjoyed the morning glory appetizer. I find the restaurant resembling to a home as deeper in the restaurant we ventured in, more books were shelved along the walls- very cozy.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Antonio C.,I had a very good pad tai. I found a nice and friendly ambiance. I would like to go back.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nikhil J.,"Good food and ambience is also good.
Both quantity and quality is good.
for official lunches its a good option to go out with your team.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nadia B.,Awesome decoration/setup inside. Very authentic food. Best Thai in the city,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tina T.,"My best friend owns a Thai restaurant so I am very picky when it comes to thai food. I have also been to Khao San Road and Pai is still one of my faves.  I have been here several times and am never disappointed. I've tried the Masaman, Green Curry, Grabong, Pad thai, Chicken Satay, Khoa Soi and  Thai Ice Tea. All so good and definitely worth the wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anthony K.,"I went there Dec 23rd this past year, roommate and I got food poisoned. He felt funky for a day, I was sick for two days during christmas eve. I was bed-ridden and shitting myself and in immense pain. I will never go there again. Had their soup and masamung curry.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin Y.,"Been here a few times, most recently for some friend's birthdays. It was packed, prepare to line up if you're coming for dinner on the weekend. We had a party of 12 so we made reservations ahead of time, they also tried to make us go with the special set menu which was $50/person, we somehow convinced them to let us order our own food. Food's always good from what I remember. definitely recommend the fried squash as an appetizer/share plate. I had the Khao Soi(egg noodles and beef in a curry sauce) which was good",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennie C.,"Wish we had Thai food of this caliber in Chicago. Ordered the tom yum soup and khao soi. The soup was fantastic! Perfectly balanced sweet, sour & salty flavors. The khao soi was super-flavorful but half-way through the dish I wished there were more herbs or lime to brighten the flavor as the curry was very heavy. Nonetheless, still enjoyed the food and would gladly return. Went for takeout on a Wednesday night around 7p, there were still some bar seats open but most of the open tables were reserved. Definitely make reservations.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Deepika G.,"Love this place! Always a lineup; you cannot go wrong ordering anything on the menu; especially the Pad Grow Pow, Khao Soi, or the Penang Curry!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Merisa L.,"Don't get me wrong, the food here is good but is it really the best Thai food in Toronto? Debatable. And there's certainly other places with just as good food for half the price. I do love the ambience here though despite what others think!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ennie L.,"Yummy yummy Thai food! We ordered take-out; pad thai, fried fish curry, beef curry, papaya salad and ground beef rice. Everything was super tasty!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,R Y.,One word - AMAZING!!  We have ordered from here so often that we have had every dish on their menu and I can honestly say that everything is delicious. Our favourites are: their fried fish (they make it with the batter so light and fried to perfection that the fish remains flaky and just delish); pad thai (absolutely no ketchup here and always leaves me craving more); beef brisket (perfect combo of spice to sweetness); beef salad (OMG refreshing and delicious); and pork satays (made with oyster sauce these morsels of pork are so addictive I could eat the entire order myself).,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ravi S.,Amazing Food. Amazing Ambience. May be the best Thai food I've had in the city. Not suprised though. Sukothai and Kao San Road are also really good. Sense of authenticity and very flavourful. Didn't hurt that they were playing a 90s hip hop playlist when I was in there too! Excellent all around.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David S.,Very delicious food!! Great atmosphere! Good service! Definitely recommend this place!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Pr N.,"Very good , always busy. The curry noodles are quite decadent & Thai green papaya shrimp salad is excellent . Also the coconuts sticky rice for dessert is amazing .",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J L.,"The pad thai was a very standard good, neither better nor worse than the pad thai I've had at more mainstream restaurants like Salad King or Spring Rolls. Frankly, I was more interested in the Grabong appetizer, vegetarian deep-fried battered squash fritters with garlic tamarind dip. If they fried it a tiny big longer to amp up the crispiness, it'd be better, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.
The restaurant was a bit noisy for my liking. Particularly if you're only eating with one other person, I'm not a big fan of places that make conversation a little difficult. It wasn't unbearable, but a concerted effort to be louder was necessary.
No complaint with the service as we got everything we ordered at a reasonable speed. Paired with the alright food, Pai get's an a-ok, but I'm not sure I'd make an effort to go there again over another Thai restaurant closer by.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael C.,"Thunder Bay On has one good old fashioned deli. Bagdona's Smoked Meats is on Simpson St just down from Nippers take out...same side of the street.
There are those city signage bylaws that can sometime make a store front blend in to the other store fronts as cars rush by. So, this little store thrives on repeat business from the neighbourhood and word of mouth. 
Inside you'll find hard working healthy smiling people serving customers from the butcher/owners to line-ups of customers(usually a good sign in itself). Just get there and you'll be impressed with the wide variety of deli meats, sausages, real cabbage rolls, pierogy, canned sauerkraut, beets, Polish and assorted national specialties.",5

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ally K.,The food is so flavourful and authentic. One of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto. Prices are about normal for the area.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Spencer G.,"Attended a private event at Phai Northern. Despite being close to capacity, the bar remained open and friendly and servers continued to make their rounds. The space is quite open which was great for mingling or finding room to the side to loiter.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Megan H.,Best food in Toronto hands down! This is my favorite place to eat and my default for impressing someone! We come here as often as we can and have ordered pickup multiple times. The Grabong and Khao Soi are absolute MUSTS! It's hard to get a table but it's worth the wait!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacintha D.,"This restaurant is always packed--generally a good sign. The early bird gets the worm; try to arrive before 5 if you'd like to avoid the long wait for a table. The spring rolls, green curry, and pad thai are all deliciously satisfying and rich in flavour. This is probably the best Thai food in downtown Toronto.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin Q.,"Flavours are more to my liking, compared to Khao San Road.
Waiting lines *seem* shorter.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,B C.,"Food: Excellent! Outside of two menu items not available to us at the time, the porterhouse steak was incredible. I would recommend serving it on a warm (rather than sizzling hot) plate as it does continue to cook on the table if you don't eat it quickly. 
Drink: Excellent! Had a Manhattan that did not disappoint and a (recommended) red that was smooth and velvety.  
Service: Excellent! Waiter was sophisticated and knowledgeable with both the culinary preparation of the food and wine pairings. His red recommendation (perhaps) made the steak that much more enjoyable. He seemed to listen to what we enjoyed from a wine and brought us back the perfect bottle. 
Ambient: Fair. Easily the most disappointing (but not enough to ruin the experience) element of the evening. The carpet was dingy and damaged from long-term ware, marble or stone flooring would spruce it up, no question. Tables are a little tighter than I would want as a guest, reserve a booth if you can get one. The one-way glass windows keeps outsiders out, however, it is distracting to watch people coming and going from the adjacent bus stop. Some type of blind, waterfall, or pianist in the corner would help to remove that distraction. 
Overall value: Moot. This is a high-end culinary diner. If you feel it is overpriced, you should have considered a lesser quality steakhouse like the Keg or equivalent. Ruth's is a superior product and (naturally) comes with prices to reflect that.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gdrm 8.,Great place. The squash fritters and green curry are amazing. Only downside is the wait times for a table.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,ZX B.,"Our end to end dining experience was very long, we had to wait a long time to be seated, waited a long time to order our food, spent 50 mins waiting for the food. When the waitress asked someone in the kitchen to come out and speak to us, the  person said, ""you haven't waited more than 30 mins yet"" which was very unapologetic and accusing. The waitress only came by twice to give us water. The flavour and taste was great however it wasn't worth the wait and the attitude really set off the taste.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Frank L.,"The decorations in this place are out of this world, very authentic relative to the feeling I got in Thailand while backpacking. The Pad Thai is to die for, get a mango juice with it too, awesome combination. Watch out for the spiciness, this is Thai spice we are talking about here, so that medium might be suicide for those inexperienced taste buds. Make sure to get a reservation on weekends, or take the chance of an hour long wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sommer W.,The food was amazing and the musical playlist was everything I needed to feed my hip hop and r&b soul!!! Dope mean and experience,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Camille D.,"Best pad thai in Toronto! Really good Thai iced tea. We always come back for the khao soi. Excellent prices, same portion sizes for lunch and dinner!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Perla S.,"Amazing food, terrible service.
Keep coming back for the incredible food, but one waitress in particular is just awful. 
Recommend the khoi soi and Thai ice tea.
Food is 5/5 every time I've been here (three times).
Worth the wait for the food.
The waitress was so awful today I had to write this review. Asked for my food to be packed up and she threw a take out box on the table and walked away. Paid the bill and tipped and didn't even get any ""thank you"" or small talk. In fact, she never came by to ask how anything was even once. Hopefully she gets her shit together.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Veny L.,"Heard Pai was branched out from Khao San Road.  Tried it twice - the Khao Soi is my favorite. However the Pad thai was not that special.  I would go to Pai for the Khao Soi and drinks, but Khao San Road for the other stir fried dishes.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joel S.,Solid offering and a good atmosphere. Definitely worth checking out a most are going to enjoy their food.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sean W.,"Great food, great ambience. There was a wait of 5 minutes but the food arrived very quickly. The service was excellent as well.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brett S.,"One of my favourite restaurants in this part of town. Ambience, food, and service has never let me down and I keep coming back whenever I'm forced to eat in the area.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kage Y.,"I have to say coming from NY, being Thai and missing home cooking. Toronto is the last place I thought I'd find good tasting authentic Thai food. I've been a lot of places and the Thai food never cuts its. Either too ""Farang"", too bland, near tasteless food is served. I walked into Pai expecting the same. Having been to the town of Pai it was awesome to walk into the restaurant full of decor. We ordered the larb, which was delicious with the added pork rine and the satay, which was also marinated right and grilled very well. Delightful appetizers. I usually judge Thai restaurants on how they make their masaman curry. With Pai that was no exception. My wife ordered the boat noodle soup The Masaman was creamy and peanut-licious. and the boat noodles had the right blend of sweet sour spice and savory. I would highly recommend ""Pai"" to anyone. Coming from a Thai person who is hard to please with Thai food. I cannot say how lucky you Torontonians have it. A true gem of a restaurant",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris M.,"Overrated and over-priced. The food is average, the staff is not overly helpful and if you ask them to pack your leftovers, they'll slam a plastic container on your table to pack it up yourself. I don't get the hype.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeannie L.,"The food at this place was very good! I came here with my boyfriend and his group of friends for dinner. The place was packed with people, it was a good thing we had a reservation. The location of this restaurant is also very convenient in downtown. The seating in this place was kind of cramped. The atmosphere at this restaurant is not the typical Thai restaurant - it is more hip in their appeal. It is like a cross between a bar and a Thai restaurant. The food here is very good. The curries were very well done. The service was good. There is also some interesting drink choices. I ordered the Ginger Beer - which I highly recommend if you like ginger. It is so good! Overall, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food even though the seating at times got a bit tight.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chloe O.,Mediocre food and so loud at lunchtime I couldn't hear my companion. No spice in the food :-(,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ali L.,"I love Pai with all my heart. My favourite is their Thai iced tea, Pad Gra Prow, butternut squash fries and their Pad thai. They're always busy even on weekdays which explains why. I will always go back!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diana H.,"it's a long wait if you don't have a reservation that you've requested over a week ago. but it's super amazing! 
i've tried a lot of dishes there (pad gra prow, green curry, khao soi, tom yum, chicken wings, pad thai, laap....) i have yet to be disappointed. I love the vibe, service is fine but the food and the drinks are awesome! HANDS DOWN BEST THAI PLACE IN TORONTO",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Warren P.,Really liked this place but get there early for lunch or make a dinner reso....filled up within 30 minutes of opening on Friday afternoon.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J J.,Always amazing! Their pad thai is just so dreamy and I crave for their pad thai literally at least once a week.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hilary C.,"Love the food here! It's a pub like atmosphere with dim lighting,  and gets pretty  noisy and crowded.  Busy times will lead to an hour and a half wait,  so try to come on a weekday for lunch or at a less busy time of day.  The khao soi is definitely a stellar dish. I get the khao soi  with braised beef.  I do think that they should give more noodles because I am always left with leftover beef and no more noodles! The braised beef is tender and tasty,  and the soup base is coconutty perfection.  Don't be afraid to order spicy... It isn't really that spicy in my opinion, and gives a nice kick.  I have also ordered the gaeng masamam with  beef, which is okay but nothing special.  It's a basic Asian tasting curry. The Thai ice tea is yummy and compliments the food.  It reminds me of cha time's original milk tea but with a slightly different flavour. Similar though.  I think my favourite on the menu has to be the Tom yum soup.  Every spoon is super flavourful and delicious. I can have a litre of it. It has a strong tomato edge to it,  which I think compliments the soup so well. Overall,  love this place!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J Alexander W.,Best Curry I've ever had. Pleasant staff. Try the coconut sorbet. Yummm. You might have to reserve for lunch (if they allow for it).,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steven H.,Visited on a Wednesday evening and it was super busy (30 min for a table of 3). Atmosphere was nice but I really don't get the hype. Fried fish was ok but pretty plain tasting. Pad Thai was good but not much better than any other Thai place. The egg noodles were probably the best dish but I ended up getting a terrible stomachache from them (I'm guessing it was this as another person in my party only ate this and also got a stomachache).,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jaycee R.,Step into Pai and feel as though you've just been swept away to a beachy vacation. I had the Green Curry which was served in a coconut - amazingly fresh and delicious!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Harinee R.,love the food here! they have tons of vegan options and have a really nice ambience too.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephen L.,"Had the spring rolls, green chicken curry and pad Thai, all fantastic with a cold beer and great ambiance.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura G.,Yummy Thai food but super hard to get into (for good reason) no matter what night of the week. The Pad Thai is of course amazing and also love the pad gra prow. Plan ahead to go on off hours if you don't want to wait but it's worth it!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,S C.,"Officially worst customer service in TO.  Been here plenty of times, including all the other thai hot spots littered throughout the core.  Tried this place on a weekday, it did disappoint for the first time, and in a big way.
Was in the mood for Panang but hadn't seen it on the menu, so asked the waitress.  Her answer was it's not on the menu but they have it ready, so I agreed.
When it came, the portion size was ridiculously small - half that of curries on the dinner menu i've ordered.  Waitress hadn't been seen for quite some time - to the point my date's pad thai was getting cold, so eventually I had to get up and get her.  She then tells me it was the lunch item (which is the same price as the dinner, but much smaller portions).  I was a little confused as none of this was mentioned to me when I ordered.  I asked to speak to a manager, as the waitresses solution is to order another lunch item (at dinner).
The manager, Mike, was extremely rude.  Request was simple, provide a dinner portion at dinner - or tell me ahead of time otherwise I never would have ordered it.  His response was the plates are already prepared for lunch by the chef and he cant provide dinner sizes at that point - as one would think you simply take a spoon, scoop, and put in bowl.  He was kind enough though to say I can pay for another one, like any top shelf manager.  This is when I understood I was provided something prepared 8 hours ago in a lunch plate which was later warmed up for my order.
His approach was confrontational, and quite pompous - completely incapable of seeing the issue - insisting Pai did me the favour by giving me something not on the menu - made 8 hours ago.  I handled it politely knowing I was done with Pai; unfortunately his attitude was something else - actually insisting not to ruin my evening by being unhappy with their dinner.
It's funny, I get the feeling his attitude and lack of customer service came from Pai being an example of being too popular for their own good.  Eventually Pai won't be the spot to go to for thai food, eventually there will be others that aren't owned by the same people who can't stop opening thai restaurants; and it will all start to fail with people like Mike, who lack the ability to see the customer's perspective and lacks overall people skills.
See ya Pai - you were good while you lasted - until you showed your true colors.  You will eventually realize you are buzz lightyear, and you aren't the s***, and you can't fly.  Until that time, to anywhere but Pai, and beyond!",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexia B.,"My favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. Usually pretty busy so expect a line, but the food is worth the wait. I'd definitely try the Thai Iced Tea, and either the pad Thai or the Khao Soi as a main",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katherine S.,"Fabulous! I was with a party of 8, we all got different dishes and all were great! Definitely busy, high noise level. Food definitely worth it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,E C.,"Delicious, authentic, great service, and amazing venue! I've come here a few times for birthdays and we ate family style and left feeling so stuffed and happy. Best Thai food in Toronto hands down. The ambiance is also perfect - there was a lot of love put into this restaurant!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vibeesh B.,Great ambiance. Packed place. Good service. Fantastic food. The hype was totally true. You cannot go wrong with this place if you like Thai food.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Avril L.,"The food is better than in Thailand itself, since I love to travel to Thailand. The music is good, the location is in central downtown, and the service is good.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sarah A.,"I love Pai. I've only been to the restaurant once but have done takeout/delivery with Uber Eats several times. They are incredibly busy (we waited an hour for a table) and the restaurant is quite loud, but it's what I'd expected. The servers and hostess did their best to accommodate us despite the huge crowd, which was much appreciated. I liked the fact that they sent you a text when a table became available. 
I have tried the golden curry with braised beef (which I found to be a little too sweet for my taste, but the beef itself was awesome), the Pad Thai, and the Pad Gra Prow, the latter of which I keep ordering. It is SO good. I do recommend that if you don't have a high tolerance to spice, stick to the mild-medium heat levels. 
If I were to go back to the restaurant to dine in, I would probably try during the day instead. They are just so crazy busy for dinner hours, right up until close. Can't give them a lower star rating just because they get a lot of customers though, it isn't their fault the food is delicious!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ty W.,This was one of the coolest dinner vibes I've ever been apart of. Fantastic food and the ambiance was amazing. Will definitely come back every time I'm in Toronto,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sydney K.,Where do I even start..... this was literally the BEST meal I have ever had. We waited over an hour to get in because it was so busy (I can see why) and I would have waited more. My friend's meals were just as good as mine if not better. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone. Even people who don't like Thai food because they'll probably like it after eating at Pai. I cannot stop thinking about my dinner. Service was also excellent. I wish I could give it 10 stars.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea H.,"So delicious, I dont even remember where I was eating thai food before Pai was in my life! My go to is the grabong to start and a veggie pad thai! Thai bucket and thai iced tea also get a shout out!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adrian G.,Best place in Toronto for some Thai food. I would recommend getting the chicken Khao Soi. Be sure to wait a long time for a table if you are a group bigger than 2 people.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Justin T.,"Pretty delicious food I must admit, ordered this from uber-eats, despite being not as 'fresh' coming from uber. But it still taste brilliantly, slightly greasy but that's to be expected from a restaurant. Ordered the thai style chicken fried rice",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,S K.,Moo Grab Pad Gra Prow Thai Spicy is my favourite! They are consistent with their quality!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M H.,"Came in 5 minutes late to a reservation... guests came 10 minutes late. Host was super accommodating and extremely polite, and let us know that although our table wasn't ready they were preparing another one, and the wait was minimal. A group of three rather rude men came in talking about how the wait was ridiculous, which the host also handled with grace. A+ for the employees here! I knew that a birthday cake would cost $1 extra per person but they also reiterated that which was nice, since they didn't wait until charging to mention it.
Also, the food is incredible! Hands down best Thai place in Toronto, the dessert is very worth it. Coconut mango rice, mmmm.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve C.,Amazing food. Khao Soi beef is classic. The soups are excelent (and a full meal),5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shahzeen J.,"I ordered the Pad Gra Prow and I love it. It's honestly so tasty and dish is filled with many flavours of sweet, spicy, and savoury. Definitely better than Khao San Road, in my opinion.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jann L.,"I found this place a bit too hipsterish in terms of the atmosphere but the food was good.  I got the beef curry with rice, Thai iced tea and spring rolls. No complaints and pretty good place to go for a special occasion.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Robin D.,This place has excellent food and a fun atmosphere. Expect to wait in line for up to an hour during peak hours. Is the food worth the wait? I'd say so.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J B.,"I've been to Pai a bunch of times at different times of day.  This place does Thai food better than anyone else in the city.
The khao soi transported me back to Chiang Mai.
The pad thai is right from the street stalls of Bangkok.
The atmosphere is nicely unlike other Thai restaurants - modern, exposed beams and a bit gritty.
The cocktails are tasty (and a bit dangerous!).
The staff is good at what they do, friendly and very approachable - a good bunch of people.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brandie D.,"This is definitely the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to. It's busy - make a reservation in advance or prepare to wait a bit. Service is amazing. AMAZING Food. Great Vibe, good prices (although alcohol is expensive). We've tried and LOVED the Green Curry, Pad Thai, Squash Fritters, Coconut Shrimp, Tom Yum soup (get the dinner size with rice - WOW), satay. You can't go wrong. Perfect menu. Perfect place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenny G.,One of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto - make reservations long in advance as they always have a line-up - well worth it!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John D.,By far the best Thai food I have ever had. Ruins conventional pad thai and regular places Thai after you have had (what I assume to be) their authentic pad thai. Pad graw prow with moo grob (crispy pork - kind of like Thai porchetta) is also fantastic. Same too for red curry with beef. Busy and loud but that adds to the ambiance. While it is worth the wait they also have highly efficient carry out. The majority of textures survive the take-out experience. Enjoy!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Moin S.,Great food though wait times can get pretty long. Been here a few times and also ordered take out. Can't go wrong if you are looking for awesome Thai food.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matthew V.,"Came for a work lunch and had a great time! Really cool atmosphere/decor and very friendly staff. We tried the spring rolls, the chicken pad thai, the pad gra prow and the green curry and none of them disappointed. 
As others have already mentioned, the wait times do get pretty crazy sometimes, highly recommend that you make a reservation ahead of time.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Oaf T.,"The food is truly amazing and staff are friendly, despite being run off their feet. The only downside is how busy the place always is, so you're almost always guaranteed a wait but, within reason, the wait is always worth it. Go. Eat. Enjoy.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ankita R.,"Amazing food and drinks, especially the green Thai curry, presented really well in a real whole coconut. It is hard to go wrong with any food order choice. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Toronto!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Greg J.,Easily one of the best Thai places in the city for authenticity and taste. Waiter spoke Thai and I was able to order in Thai. Very impressed. Atmosphere is great too. Highly recommend.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Paro B.,One of the best thai places in Toronto. Super cool vibe and great food!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Venessa R.,My boyfiend and i were on vaca in toronto and were looking for somewhere good to eat downtown toronto. We decided on thai and came across this place on yelp which had good reviews. I saw that it closed ar 1030 and it was around 10 so we had to hurry. We got lost finding this place and we didnt find parking until about 1025. The nice gentleman at the door was kind enough to still let us be seated. We got an app which was the thai chicken wings were crispy and flavorful. We got drinks which were good and our food was amazing. Our server was super nice too! This was such a great experience for our first dinner in toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nirak I.,"Found this delightful spot as I was meeting a business colleague for lunch who is both vegetarian and gluten free.  Chose the spot thanks to Yelp reviews.
Despite begin full with the lunch crowd, we arrived towards the end of the lunch hour and had a short wait.  Love the funky, diverse decor.
Service staff friendly, attentive to the right level and worked together as a team to serve us.  All appreciative. 
We both had versions of the Pad Thai.  Great to see that they customize the spiciness level to the tastes of the customer.  Mine could have been a bit more spicy.... now I know how the range works, I'll be able to order better.   My colleague had a nice selection of vegetarian options with ability to have it served gluten free.
Great flavours in the Pad Thai and servings size were great for a lunch.... not too much,  not too little.  
Will definitely go again to try other menu items.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M P.,"Pay is a fun, low-key Thai restaurant. The food is solidly good and the staff are friendly. The restaurant accommodates both small parties and large groups. It can be loud at times, but the atmosphere is still great for catching up with friends over a Thai dinner and a drink.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lynn C.,"The food is great, but I hate the wait. Textures, flavours, atmosphere, everything else is awesome. If you're looking for a place with atmosphere and good food, then this is a nice spot (unless you don't want to wait). Don't forget to share a Thai bucket :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Keira M.,"I loved this restaurant! The decoration inside the restaurant is nice and food was great.
The service could be better so I gave 4 stars.
Pai is my new favorite Thai restaurant.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karen P.,"Came here to try it out since everyone was telling me I needed to come try! 
I ordered 3 items with a friend and a Thai Ice Tea. 
Moo Ping - I was not that excited for this to be honest as pork tends to be dry at a lot of places. Oh my god it was so yummy though! Very juicy and full of flavour! I never knew pork skewers could be so tender. 5/5 
Gai Satay - after having the moo ping, I thought the chicken skewer had to be amazing. I was very disappointed however as they were very dry and chewy. The sauce was okay but the chicken really ruined the whole thing. 2/5
Chicken Pad Thai - The Pad Thai was amazing! It was not too dry not too saucy and very flavourful. It is still missing something...not quite sure what. 4/5
Service - waiters were great! The place was very busy but waiters were pleasant nonetheless which is great! The water canters are also so cute! They make cute tweet sounds :) 
All on all, I highly recommend!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matthew G.,"We started with two apps: the port skewers which were tasty, and the beef salad which is supposed to be seasoned with chili lime but instead was overpowered with hot chillies leaving any lime flavor not tasteable. For our mains my girlfriend had a shrimp basil stir fry which was tasty. I had the massaman curry with braised beef. Again the dish was overpowered by spice so strong I couldn't taste the flavor. Keep in mind this is coming from someone who loves spicy food.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Al D.,"Atmosphere was casual and hip, food and drinks were amazing, and service/servers were fantastic and very kind. I loved this place. As soon as I walked in I loved the fun and relaxing atmosphere. Our servers were very nice and chatted shortly with us.  Would come back even just for drinks.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dougal G.,"80% authentic, 20% sugar. Head here if you like food that is really close to Thai food, just with 2-4 extra tablespoons of sugar added in.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rob M.,Off the charts!  What a surprise and definitely will be eating there whenever I am in town!  Service was off the charts and company was made a believer in Thai food!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Henna P.,Amazing service. The fish was cooked to perfection. Perfectly crispy outside and perfectly soft and mouthwatering on the inside. The green curry was amazing too!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jay T.,Went on a Friday night and they said they only had the tables where you kneel available but there was around 6-7 tables free.  Tables were still free when we left so I don't know what they were saying. Only reason I am giving this place such a low score is that I had the worst stomach ache after.  I did enjoy the food when I was there.  I got the Khao Soi and the Pad Gra Prow.  Price is on par with the likes of Khao San Road which I prefer.  Service was not up to par as well.  Slow servers that keeps forgetting things and they didn't have the mango sticky rice as well when I was there. It was only 7pm on a Friday night.  Was pretty disappointed.,2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Olivier L.,"My friend and I were craving Thai food for dinner so we decided to check this place out.  As what many are saying, this place is VERY busy.  If you don't have reservations, expect to wait at least 30 minutes.  The food was very enjoyable and we were both very pleased with how authentic the dishes were (Gai Satay, Pad Thai and Khao Soi).  
As for service, we sat at the end of the bar. Our waiter was nowhere to be found; other than taking our orders and getting the bill, he was nowhere to be found.  The bartender seemed to have an angry/stressed face; probably because of how busy it was.
If you're debating to come here, just be sure to book ahead of time or else you'll be standing around with dozens of other people waiting for a table.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tina N.,don't know what the hype is about. the food was mediocre and service wasn't that great.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Vanessa C.,"Just had a wonderful lunch experience at Pai, atmosphere was great, seating was smooth, food was flavorful, and decorations reminded me of Thailand. I strongly recommend this place for lunch or dinner, and I hope to revisit this restaurant again very soon!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jimmy P.,"this review is for the food.  i love their food. my buddy who went to thai land says native thai food tastes better but this place is close.  However, I give a 3 star for the servers/wait staff because some of them are rude and arrogant and feel they can treat you however they want because of repeat customers...that's fine, make sure you reflect your grievance in the gratuity.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kasun J.,"Love the strong flavours in their dishes! You get so much for what you pay for as well. You could just go for one of the main dishes and walk out of the place incredibly stuffed!
I've aready gone back several times",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,William B.,"We came here for an early dinner and were surprised by a waiting line for those (like us) who thought that reservations weren't necessary a bit before 5PM.  After a reasonable wait, we were seated and, having read the reviews and checked out the menu online, ordered right away.  The grabang squash fritters were good if a tad greasy, but the Singha beers ordered to go with them never arrived.  Our busy waitperson was apparently covering too many tables, thought we had the beers, and questioned if we were getting for a second round when we asked where they were.  That was the only glitch in service from an otherwise attentive and personable server.  The Chiang Ma beef noodle soup and the Khao Sol with beef were both worthy of five stars. Would we go back?  Most certainly.  The ambience isn't great, but the food is excellent by any measure.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laurie H.,"This place was absolutely, mindblowingly AMAZING. So glad I never have to go back to Khao San Road ever again.  Loved the decor, the perfectly spiced green curry served in a carved out coconut and in particular, the mango sticky rice. Very authentic Thai food and wonderful, hospitable service.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Neha K.,"For those who liked Khao San Road and Sukho Thai, this place should definitely be on top of your list! The food is incredible & authentic. I recommend the Pad Gra Prow, Gaeng Kiaw Wan (in a coconut) and the Khao Soi. You cannot leave without trying the mango on sticky rice! This place is worth the wait but try to go on a weeknight to minimize wait times. Enjoy :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ramnique M.,A small dimly-lit restaurant well-nestled inside the hotel; In need of some updating especially juxtaposed to the newly furnished lobby. Service was very prompt and courteous. I ordered dinner which was quite palatable. The dishes were exquisite in their palatable detail. A taste of plain old macroni with shrimp (although I had ordered spaghetti-a faux pas!) revealed a melee of several variants of cheese in addition to ground nuts.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nish M.,The hype is real. Tried the Khao Soi and it was everything! Soulfully delectable food. Will definitely go again!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel F.,"Wish I could review this place. They don't take reservations and who can afford to wait a half hour for a table and probably another half hour to eat when you're hungry. 
Tried eating here when it was Khan San Road. The same thing.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Livi L.,The curry noodles (khao soi braised beef) are great! The curry is the right amount of spice and the braised beef is soft and tender. It comes with crispy noodles which i love! Note that this place gets extremely busy so try to come before 6pm to get guarenteed seatings or prepare to wait for an hour....,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sally K.,Great location and environment. Not the best thai food I've had but very decent. Even the mild is spicy - be careful.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,John M.,"Place looks very unassuming, but it is without a doubt the best Thai food I had ever had. The que out the door speaks for itself. Great food, great service!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cole B.,This was place is awesome. Will be back for the chicken pad Thai. The atmosphere was great and worth the wait.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Yolanda T.,"Delightful food! Highly recommend the moo ping and the Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. The sauce was sweet, spicy and thick. I enjoyed the man's chicken pad Thai as well but I wanted to concentrate on mine.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sonia A.,"The best thai food in the City.  Super authentic!
Owners and staff are great.  Super helpful.
It's always busy so defnt make a reservation.  
Monday-Thursday you may be able to do a walk-in but Friday's there's a line out the door.
Food and quality of presentation are great.
Green chicken curry is amazing.
Thai Spice is suppppperrrr hooooottt.  So warning on that.
Kao Soy is another favorite. 
Mango Salad is sweet and flavourful.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mihir P.,"The Hosts and hostesses are awful and very incompetent. The food is ok but the overall service, especially upon entering, is extremely poor",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lev K.,"Great food, and great ambiance... After an hour here, totally felt like I would be stepping out onto a busy streets of Bangkok after this looking for my regular tuk tuk... Try the beef salad, the meat is pe factory tender and flavourful.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura Y.,"The food was alright, nothing amazing. I was even a little disappointed considering the high reviews on yelp. The environment was very loud, too loud to have a conversation.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jamie K.,Ate here while visiting Toronto and can honestly say this is the best Thai food I've ever had. It is worth the wait! Best part is that you can enjoy appetizers and drinks at the side bar while waiting to be seated. This came in clutch with a hangry partner. We started with the spring rolls and shrimp. Both incredibly delicious and fresh. We both had Pad Thai with chicken which was really good and had a nice kick to it (you can choose your own level of spice). Overall the dish had a great combination of tastes and textures. Highly recommend! We also shared a couple pictures of the sangria... drink this! Delicious sangria with pineapples and actual lychee pieces. It went down too smooth. ;) Highly recommend this place for locals and passerbyers alike!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jeffrey C.,Delicious food and cozy atmosphere.  Went for both lunch and dinner for different occasions.  Will definitely return again.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda J.,Super busy as always. Still my fav Thai place in the Dt core. But unfortunately they increased the price again,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sandy K.,"Great food and generous portions. Three of us shared two appetizers then had a main each, and there was more than enough. Fun vibe.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leanne F.,"If you've ever been to Thailand you will feel like you are back there again when you walk into this restaurant. Music and atmosphere are very cozy and casual, service was great. We went at around 6/630 on a Monday night and there was still a 35 min wait to get in so we sat at the bar and the service was still good. The host informed us on weekends sometimes you have to make reso's 3 weeks in advance! Food came out fast and tasted amazing, although the deep fried tiger shrimp didn't taste as impressive as it should have. The green coconut curry served in a real coconut was delicious. The Thai iced tea is made in house and made in vast quantities to keep up the demand for it, because it really is delicious and a must-try. 
Will definitely be eating there again! Wish there was more selection on the menu and I found it weird we didn't have small side plates and had to ask for them, as many Thai dishes are supposed to be shareable.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maggie Y.,"The restaurant is always busy but well worth the 45 minute wait (maybe not in -30 degree weather). We has their pad thai, and both curries on the menu and they are absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is chill. We also ordered ginger beer and lemongrass soda.
The only drawback is that it took a while to get our food. If they could fix that I would give these guys five stars.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha G.,"Really love this place.  It's very similar to Khao San Road, but without the long lines. Love the decor here. Great for large groups or date night. Already planning our next trip here.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dian W.,Best thai food I've ever had in my life. Five stars to the food. The waiting time was long but totally worth it,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jaclyn T.,Absolutely delicious!! Always fresh and good portions. Hard to get a table at certain times but worth the wait. I just got back from Thailand and continuously compared the food to Pai Toronto. Same if not better than food in Thailand.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zay A.,Great egg rolls and Thai beer. Food was also very delicious. Definitely worth the long wait.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Samantha Y.,"Amazing food and fun, loud atmosphere with good music (usually hip hop). Amazing to dine in or order takeout, plus the night markets are so cute.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mikael P.,"Easily the best Thai I've found in Canada. Similar spices to what I found in Puckett, but with higher quality ingredients. Bartenders were all awesome people. I went nearly every day. Pad Thai, green curry, and the noodle soup are all killer. Shrimp are of an excellent size. Great place.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anna C.,"Ah Pai, another jewel in Chef Nuit Regular's crown - a woman who has conquered Toronto's over saturated Thai cuisine scene! As with her other restaurants, the stand out dish is the Khao Soi. Another great item is the iced tea which is infused with kaffir lime. In summation, the food is stellar but the atmosphere is less inviting (the lighting is on the dimmer side making it hard to appreciate the visual aspects of dishes and be able to see what yore eating!)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela S.,"Oh lord, so so so good, the pad gra ma, with beef or pork, who knew something could be that tasty, so amazing!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Theresa A.,"I found this place on Yelp as it was only 0.2 miles from my hotel and I was craving some Thai food. The pad thai is absolutely delicious as are the spring rolls. There was so much food and even after I was stuffed full, I probably could have eaten another bowl of pad thai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Izzy T.,"I'm just going to say it - I thought this place was better than Khao San Road. Equally tasty food, speedier delivery of the meals, bigger portions, more comfortable and visually appealing interior setting, better prices, and -oh yes - no one-hour wait for a table. In fact, we waltzed right in and were eating our delicious meals within fifteen minutes of walking through the doors. (This was at 5pm on a Thursday)
I had the Pad Thai with tofu at the 'foreigner' (lol) level of spiciness and, I must say, the spice level was absolutely spot on. I'm always wary of the variation in spice levels between restaurants, but the 'foreigner' level was just PERFECT for me personally. It had a decidedly hot kick to it, but one that allowed all the other flavours to come through in a nice balance, something that I suspect may not have been achieved at the ultimate level of spiciness in this restaurant (Thai Spicy).
My Pad Thai was delicious, and very generous in the ratio of tofu, veggies and  peanuts to noodles. In fact, I think this was one of the few Pad Thais I've ever had that had that crunchy, nutty texture to it - everywhere else I've been seemed to skimp on the nuts a bit and left the sauce and noodles lying in a vaguely slimy mess. I really noticed the crunchy difference here and would definitely try this dish again upon my next visit. The portion was huge, and more than half was taken away in a container for the next days' lunch. 
Soft drinks were served in pint size glasses (great value) and the tap water came in a bizarre tumbler that made a tweety-bird noise as you poured it! 
Only downside was the service. Although our orders were taken quickly and food delivered fresh to the table within minutes, we were waiting what seemed like an eternity for the bill after we requested it. This was a bit stressful as we were in a hurry to be elsewhere after our meal and almost ended up being late. Also, neither the host nor the server cracked a smile or uttered a 'thank you' or anything remotely civil during our whole stay. This was disappointing as the restaurant was far from busy at the time, so it was a bit of a bummer to see such miserable staff.
In terms of the food and attractive setting though, this place is an easy five stars. I will return, despite the crankiness.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexa X.,"Just came back from by birthday dinner at Pai. Everything we ate and drank was so amazing! I initially made a reservation for 7 people, some couldn't make it and when I tried to change to reservation to 4 people it wouldn't allow for it and next thing I knew, I got an email that said my reservation was cancelled -I guess something went wrong with the Bookenda reservation system (or me). When we got to Pai, it was lined up and I explained my situtation, they sat us pretty quickly and even though the place was packed everything still went great. I'm celiac and they clearly mark all of the gluten-allergy alert foods with a purple dot, making everything extra easy. We got great drinks, the Plum Mule ($10) was the best for sure, and the papaya and salted crab salad was excellent -although ""foreigner spicy"" is actually really spicy! Thoroughly loved it at Pai!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M V.,"Delicious - really great food and good service. Ambiance is loud and busting, which is really fun as well. Pai is a Toronto staple and a must-try.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sara B.,"This is, hands down, my favorite Thai restaurant. I'm from Chicago and have tried Thai places all over the United States-- nothing compares to this! I got the chicken green curry and Thai iced tea. The chicken green curry is a bit spicy and may be too spicy for those who can't tolerate it. For those we can tolerate spice, it's a nice kick! Will definitely be coming back as much as I can!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sammy M.,"One of my favourite restaurants!!! Food is amazing, beer is great, service is awesome. Always recommend!!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Khloe R.,"One of my favourite thai restaurants in the city :) it gets a little crowded since it's a small place, but the food and service is always on point. Incredibly authentic, delicious thai food. Highly recommend it!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susan M.,The price is pretty much the same as other restaurants in the area. I love the curry and the fried squash here. This is usually my go-to Thai restaurant; I could do without the line ups but that's the price you pay for quality.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Danny B.,"I went by myself that day, and though it was my first time and I didn't try their specialties, the food was great! Wasn't too sweet or sour, and just the right amount of spiciness. The restaurant was also clean and looked very nice. Service was satisfactory also. Will come back next time I visit Toronto. :)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dora T.,Delicious food. Love their tom yum soup! The most authentic and tasty Tom yum soup I have had in Toronto. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rob H.,"Stop looking and eat here. Well worth the wait, I love Thai food, but I feel like this is the first real Thai I have ever had. I had beef brisket in golden curry, simply amazing. My wife had green curry served in a coconut. She ordered ""foreigner-spicy"", which I thought was quite mild. Great beer selection too.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Akin O.,"This is the best Thai food I've had since coming back from Thailand. I'm obsessed with this place and wish I lived closer to Toronto so that I could go back more frequently. The Khao Soi, Pad Gra Praw w/ egg, and the Massaman braised beef were all delectable! Eating in was dope, the vibes of the restaurant are chill and the staff is really friendly and approachable. Can't wait to visit again",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sami M.,Great phad thai and pad gra pow (essentially meat on rice - soo tasty!). Kao soi was a bit rich for my taste but most people really like it. Gets very busy at lunch and dinner so make a reso!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sonia C.,Pai was huge compared to Khao San road. Not that they're the same but I find the Khao soi tastier at Pai. But the Thai ice tea at Khao San road is better.  This place is bigger and not as hot as Khao San road so sitting was more comfortable on a hot day.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chris M.,"Found this place searching on Yelp while we were in Toronto for 2 days. What a great find! Service was superb and the atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for. Never had Thai Iced Tea before and fell in love. Really enjoyed the chicken wings, soup and mains. Could not have been better!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Renisha I.,Amazing food! The tom yum soup is my favourite. I have been here several times and it is still my favourite thai food spot. Warning: do not get the thai spice level of spie!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Phillip S.,Very Authentic Thai restaurant. Food is testy and great. Service is with smile. I will go again for sure.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,AJ D.,"Very good food, had the green curry and some appetizers--fried squash, chicken and spring rolls. This is not an easy place to eat at if you are watching carb intake, however. 95% of menu is noodles and rice based, but of course, very very flavourful. Everything was super tasty, especially the squash appetizer. We sat on the stage on the floor, which I wouldn't recommend if you have back issues because three days later I am still sore. Next time I would go back and sit at a regular table and drink water all day to splurge in the evening.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jason D.,"Ordered on Maegan - app said food would be here in an hour - it took an hour and a half.  Let's get one thing straight - the food is excellent; it's really good.  The thing that bugged me is that the food was really late and I was fed the line that it was the third party app's fault.  The staff was nice but the excuse seemed rehearsed.  Bottom line is that slow food is not the customer's problem; it's yours.  Tell us it's going to be slow, and we can choose to order or not and frankly worth the wait.  Again - the food shows finesse and passion; my advice is to show the same vigor with negotiating your third party contracts.  Ultimately, it's your restaurant and your customers.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rumsha A.,"As per all the other reviews on here, the food at PAI gets a 5-star rating -- it's simply phenomenal, and an experience for all 5 senses.
That said, I personally find the quarters cramped and far too loud. I've been here a few times and its been near impossible to have a conversation with my mates, even when they're barely two feet across from me. Also, the service does tend to be quite rushed (though that might just be because of the continuous line of people who are waiting for a table), but the wait-staff is never without a smile and some friendly chatter. The food may be delicious, and the service OK, but I'd recommend going somewhere else if you're hoping to catch up with your date.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sophia M.,"It's pretty good for Americans who would like to try authentic Thai food but not up for the pure real authentic Thai meal. I ordered the papaya salad, lemon grass tom yum soup, pad Thai, and masaman curry. All was good with spices.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andy T.,"Food was pretty good. Thai food can be really spicy so watch out!
Moo Ping (pork skewers) were really tasty.
The Pad Gra Prow was average. I asked for spicy and it was really spicy! It tasted better as the meal progressed though.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alisha J.,"Khao soi is an absolute must, under no circumstances should you substitute the egg noodles for rice noodles (read: literally nobody cares about your fake gluten allergy)",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aurora L.,"First time at Pai dining with company who have been here before and wow, was it amazing?!  Very cute establishment with lovely ambiance.  We were starving so I think it didn't help that the maybe 25 mins. wait for food felt like eternity...but once served, it was so worth the wait.  Had the deep fried basa fillets served with a side of rice and two sauces...utterly delicious!  So flavourful, lightly fried and well complimented by the rice...and I barely even eat rice!  Sampled my company's foods and the curry and soup dishes were so rich.  Haven't had authentic Thai for quite so time and am used to the standard dishes but Pai really raised the bar.  Great portions and pricing, well done!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christine L.,"This is officially my favourite Thai restaurant in downtown! The food is great, I love almost everything on the menu! The environment is very cool, definitely recommend this place!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela L.,"Authentic, delicious and simple Thai food. So much like food from Thailand! The curries, khak soi and skewers are amazing. Also, the Thai iced tea is a MUST HAVE. The wait gets long, so definitely make a reservation a day in advance!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shameen M.,"The Grabong (deep fried squash fritters), pad thai, gaeng kiaw wan and gaeng masaman with braised beef is an absolute must! If you can handle the mango sticky rice at the end, make sure you get it, or save your belly until next time. I recommend stretchy pants, a loose sweater and a good walk after this meal to help digest all the noodles, rice and deliciousness! A cool and relaxing atmosphere to hang out with friends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amy H.,"I went to this restaurant twice, and ordered different items each time. The food is decent, but a bit too oily and fried for my liking. You could really taste the oil in the dish, which made it a off-putting. Other than that, the place was small, but cute. Service was nothing special - if anything, waiters were a bit slow since this place always seems to be packed. Overall, if you're in the area, this place could be worth stopping by for a quick bite, but its not my favourite spot.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susan T.,Easily my favourite Thai restaurant in this city! The owners are humble and nice too!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michelle D.,One of my favourite Thai restaurants. I only wish the wait time to getting a table was a little shorter.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Monica C.,The food here is amazing! Only problem is sometimes their service can be bad. I left a shopping bag there once and called twice and they told me it wasn't there. I came back and it was just sitting on the floor in the restaurant so they clearly just didn't check.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aliya C.,"Went to this restaurant for lunch today. The food was good. However, I will never come this restaurant again because of there insistence on ripping off the customer. I ordered a $5 Thai iced tea. The cup came out with 1.5oz of liquid with the rest filled to the brim with ice. Upon asking for slightly less ice, the server was rude and unaccommodating. When it was time to pay the bill, an mandatory 20% gratuity was included in the bill. I've never come across a gratuity this high, especially for rather sub-par service. As a student, 20% is difficult to manage. It is presumptuous and a clear indication of their priorities.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Catherine L.,"I came here for lunch because of the yelp reviews and was glad I did. Immediately I was drawn to the atmosphere and the decor. It feels like an underground street style but very hip hangout spot that you would find in Thailand even if I've never been (but a little imagination is all you need ;)). I went around 2 pm and we were quickly seated. The menu was hand drawn and coloured which I thought was very cute and contrasted the hip hop music blasting in the background (the choice of music was definitely a bonus for me). I ordered the Pad thai and my friend ordered the Pad gra prow. You can choose the level of spiciness, I chose the foreigner spicy which I thought was just right but next time I would definitely try the thai spicy for a good challenge (being the chili fan that I am). We had to wait quite a while for our food to come, not sure if it was because of the time we went or it's usually like this. The portions were moderate. My pad thai was good but it was too different from pad thais I've had in the past. However, I really enjoyed the pad gra prow which is apparently a popular street dish, it's basically rice with ground meat topped with fried egg. They serve a special sauce on the side for you to pour over the rice. I'm not sure what they put in the sauce aside from fish sauce but I was quite blown away by how good it tasted. The price of their entrees ranges from $11-13 which I find to be very reasonable. I would definitely come back again :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rose J.,Thanks goodness for Pai!  Seating is spacious.  Food is delicious. Service is attentive.  Decor has nice authentic touches.  Music adds a definite fun and relaxing vibe.  There is a comfortable stage seating area where you can spread out after eating your heart's desire.   Loved the coconut bowl for my green curry.  Got to scrape the young coconut off from the inside which enhanced the eating experience.  So glad this place opened up!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea L.,The masaman curry is unbelievable!  The wait on a weeknight was around 40 mins. Well worth it!  Love that you can have drinks while you wait and they will put it on your tab. Would highly recommend. Best Thai food I've ever had! Some of the seats are at the bar and some are traditionally Thai style (sitting on the floor on cushions without shoes on). Most seating is at tables.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Hans D.,"We just came off of a 6hr flight and had to get something into our system. We found this spot on yelp and didn't bat an eye. Northern Thai five minutes walk from the hotel. There was a line from the door to the hostess however it moved quickly and we were seated in roughly ten minutes. We ordered spring rolls, starter Tom yum soup, grabong, Gaeng Kiaw Wan, Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork belly and we shared everything. Amazing meal. Great service and when they ask if you want spicy I suggest, even if you are a pepper connoisseur, maybe take the spicy level below the top of the meter. I can handle hot spice being from the Caribbean but they aren't shabby in that department. The lychee juice was really nice as well. Service was great. We will be back. Also want to note that some extra folks joined us after the order was taken and the kind host didn't bat an eye and accommodated everyone as if they came at the same Time. Great downtown Toronto spot.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Neha K.,"I used to live around the corner from Pai and I am not embarrassed to admit it became a weekly thang for me. The flavours are so on point, you can't help coming back. Compared to other players in the Toronto Thai food scene, I'd say Pai's big level up is the space in the restaurant and ambiance.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tanya L.,So delicious! Atmosphere is great and staff is very professional. The food is fantastic and menu options are great. Very good at accommodating allergies.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anne B.,I had the green curry chicken.  Amazing meal! Definitely recommend going there.  My friends who were with me recently came back from Asia said the food was very authentic and a perfect place to go to if your craving a good pad thai.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Denis W.,"Awesome green curry ""best ever"" & the Ox Tail is a must try!   Service was very helpful, all that was recommended on the menu was a hit for our group of six.  Great vibe and fun setting!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,S G.,"Definitely one of my favourite places to go for Thai food in the city!  Great food and knowledgeable staff.  Always a big line up, but the space is pretty big and the line moves fast.  Make a reso in advance if you can!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Natasha G.,"Went here a few times and Pai never disappoints. Basically everything is flavourful and well cooked, especially the pad thai. The atmosphere is nice. Got food delivered once - took about 30 minutes and all the dishes were hot.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike M.,"My wife and I both enjoy thai food, so when this popped up as a nearby restaurant while we were visiting Toronto, we gave it a shot.  The reviews looked promising so that certainly helped in our decision.  There was a moderate wait when we got there so we browsed the menu while grabbing a drink at the bar.  She drank a thai mojito that she very much enjoyed while I had a sake bomb (Saturday night shot special).  We then were taken to our seats and started with some spring rolls which were delicious.  I got myself a beer stein of Sapporo (loved the huge beer steins!) and she had their Sangria which was alright.
For the main course I had their Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken at the Thai spicy level (which they advertise as being as spicy as it gets).  I've done this in the past at other thai restaurants and feel that sometimes they hold back still.  I felt the spice level was great, but would not have minded an even spicier kick to this dish.  Regardless, everything about this dish was delicious and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  My wife got the Pad Cha Hett which she thought was very good.  Since this dish only comes as mild, my wife did ask for hot chili oil on the side to spice it up a bit and they had no problem accommodating that.
Overall, we were very pleased with our decision to come here.  I know some of the other reviews question the service, which from what I observed they seemed very busy.  We did have to wait a bit for a refill on water, but otherwise I thought the wait staff were attentive enough.  I'm sure this can be hit and miss depending on the time but the food itself was so good that I'm sure anyone dining here will not be disappointed.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Margaret G.,THE. BEST.  I eat here at least once a week.  There isn't a single thing on the menu that isn't delicious.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shawn P.,"For the most part authentic Thai food in Toronto has been served in places decorated with elephants and Buddha statues but Pai has introduced the concept of serving this popular fare in a Duncan street rabbit hole designed for basement dwelling hipsters. It is small, crowded and hectic. The service was efficient but a little scattered and inconsistent at times. They do take bookenda reservations, however, so planning ahead ultimately avoids a lot of headaches.  The food lives up to the hype by offering authentic recognizable dishes such as pad thai, tom yum soup and spring rolls as well as other favourites such as green curry and Thai sausage.  The rolls (with the kicking dipping sauce), soup and noodles deserve honorable mention but the curry, in particular, was among one of the best I have had.  Maybe it was the cute coconut as a vessel but the consummate flavours and tender beef made it the premier dish of the evening.   The accompanying sauces such as the Thai relish served with the sausage were delicious.  The Thai caesar platter, although an interesting and exciting concept, was disappointing mainly due to the lackluster Caeser mix and boring shrimp sauce.  I loved the option of farang (foreigner) spicy which added a great bite while respecting the other flavours such as kaffir lime leaf and lemongrass.  Price wise, it's definitely more expensive than Salad King or most hole in the walls but very much in line with other hipster destinations offering noise and chaos as menu options.
I would have liked to give it 3.14159265359 out of 5 but it deserves at least a 4.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J M.,We got there around 6:30 on sat night without reservation. We were in line for about 30 min to put our names to the waitlst then it was another 20 min or so until we finally got our table. Definitely worth the wait but I'll make a reservation next time lol We ordered pad Thai and khao soi and they were both flavourful and delicious. I loved their iced thai tea as well!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael C.,This was a great find while in Toronto. Delicious Thai food. Great drinks. Service was excellent. We will go back on our next trip to Toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lina Y.,"really good Thai food, central location, i recommend it. comfortable sitting. 
if you are looking for a good thai joint, you will not go wrong with this choice.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kyle P.,Really great pad Thai - we got in early and were seated in five minutes. Perfect place for a cozy Sunday night dinner!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Reb Z.,"Delicious, have not been disappointed. Food is always on point and probably the best Thai food in the city!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ying Woei O.,A very popular place. You need to make reservations ahead of time. It's hard to call them. You are better off with dropping by a few days ahead to make reservations. Best Thai food yet in town!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brianna T.,"My husband and I ordered food to go from here and we thought it would be much better than it was reading previous reviews on Yelp
First let me tell you my husband is half Thai and we are used to eating authentic Thai food-
We ordered the vegetable pad Thai-which was sweet, not spicy (we ordered medium) and the noodles were clumped together. There was hardly any vegetables in it, 2 pieces of broccoli and 3 pieces of cauliflower and some carrots. 
Tom yum soup- also kinda sweet. We are used to a more clear broth when lemongrass and more spices
Green curry-my husband said was okay
Pad Gra Prow with tofu-this is something similar to stir fried basil and it had literally no sauce or flavor aside from the tofu. No vegetables in it, basically a bed of jasmine rice with tofu and some basil. Totally not impressed. I don't get what all the hype is about. 
We've ordered to go food from plenty of Thai restaurants and not had issues like this. 
I gave it 3 stars because it was super convenient  that they deliver food.  
Would not recommend or go back.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alan K.,"Finally revisited place and it was a fantastic choice.  This time around, I tried their spring rolls as starters and then their Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork as my main.  And both were absolutely amazing.  The spring rolls were nicely crispy and not greasy at all.  And the pad gra prow was a fantastic mix of crunchy (from the crispy pork skin), hot, spicy, sweet, and sour with herbal undertones due to the addition of Thai basil.  It was quite possibly the finest Thai food I've ever eaten.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steven C.,This is my favorite place to go for Thai food. Every dish is so flavorful and well thought out. perfect balance between sweet and sour. Would definitely recommend.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Victoria M.,"This is my favourite Thai restaurant ever. The food is delicious, a great price, and a great size serving.  I usually do a take out order and have always had extremely fresh to order pad thai. I have a food sensitivity issue and they always make sure that my order is correct, I really can't say how much I appreciate that. The service is impeccable whether you do a take out order or sit down to eat in the restaurant.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Leigh O.,This place is unbelievably amazing. My Mom ordered the Green Curry which comes IN A COCONUT people. In a coconut. I ordered the Khao Soi which was unbelievably creamy and decadent. I will be going back here time and time again over Khao San Road. Thank you Pai for bringing delicious Thai food to our city!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Karen H.,"Amazing Group Private Dining Event!!!
Every dish in family-style price fixe was delicious. The menu was reasonably priced for private dining. Pai is definitely my favourite Thai place and I'm a picky foodie! 
JJ, the manager was extremely helpful with my large holiday dinner of about 20 guests.
Pai accommodated some of my guests' tardiness when they arrived a bit late (some places give away your reservation if your entire party doesn't arrive within 15 minutes!). Even three guests that had an last minute emergency were excused (most private dining reservations charge a fee for no-shows). They even offered us separate bills which is extremely rare with large groups! I thought this was a wonderful gesture! They helped accommodate my guests with dietary restrictions/allergies (eg. Peanuts/Seafood/Pork/Vegetarian) and didn't charge deposit or require my credit card information unlike other private dining restaurants. There was so much food, we were all stuffed and everything was perfect. 
I cannot stress enough how great the experience and service was. I'll definitely be back and highly recommend a private dining event.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shae T.,"Straightforward Thai food. I had the green curry with chicken, and it was solid.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thileepan V.,"Really Good food. Always busy! Prepare to wait 25-30 minutes during lunch time.Food is always flavorful and delicious, well worth the wait and price. I'll keep coming back! i visitied 4 times within 6 months :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alon O.,when i thought that i knew all i could know about thai food here came Pai. excellent flavours. Great presentation (love curry in the actual coconut and once done don't forget to dig into the coconut flesh with a spoon). Happy and energetic atmosphere this is an area that most Thai places fail to deliver but not Pai.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin Y.,"This is my favorite Thai place near the TIFF Lightbox. For $13, you get a GENEROUS serving of braised beef in massaman curry sauce as well as enough rice to fill you right up. I also had the Moo Ping and it's probably the most succulent skewered pork that I have ever had in my entire life. The wait time for food is a bit long during peak hours but it was worth it! We dined at the bar and the bartender was also kind enough to give us a sample of the Thai Iced Tea when my friend pointed to it. Overall it was a great dining experience and it'll be tough to top this level of quality!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Thomas Y.,Excellent Pad Thai. Just the right quantity without being too oily. Would come back.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lea Y.,"Delicious food and fast service.  Try the vegetarian spring rolls and the Pad Thai.  Green Curry was great, as was the fried fish plate.  My only complaint -- LOUD inside the restaurant, but other than that it was a first rate meal, good prices and conveniently located for those of us attending the Toronto Film Festival.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Divya B.,"We had to order in because of a long day and had  toddlers for company. Got foreigner spicy papaya salad-nailed it, mushroom  spring rolls-decadent, massaman curry- delicious and the thai spicy pad thai which was simply glorious. I'm drooling again just writing this review.  Not really street style , but can't go wrong if you enjoy good thai food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Camden A.,"Definitely one of the better Thai places in the city.  Busy place, so can be a bit slow - especially takeout - but food was tasty.  Appetizers a bit smaller than expected.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J A.,"Food is fantastic but as with Chef Nuit's previous digs (Khao San Road) the service is slow when its busy. Seems the kitchen is backlogged a lot of the time.
If you have a longer lunch or are not in a rush for dinner, its fine, just know what you're getting into.
Menu seems to be evolving but everything we had was a hit. Come have some before it gets too busy to get a seat :)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michele W.,"This, khao san road, sukhothai, all the same owners, and none have disappointed so far. Food is always solid, and there are always a few of the same dishes with a small number of new items. I wish it was a bit faster since it always seems to take ar least 40 minutes for food to arrive but overall it's always a safe bet",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Harold C.,"I like the food since it got the real authentic thai taste. I especially like the green curry rice. The quality-to-food ratio is decent. 
however,i do not like how they arrange seating for their customers. We waited for at least an hour and we still couldn't get a table. I think they should have a more efficient  and/or quicker way to get the customers seated.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tim L.,"I fell in love with a new Thai place that has forever changed the way my tastebuds will react to this category of food. And I promised in my other Yelp review I would have to change this one to reflect how good the new place is. Pai is still dope, but love is a b****.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sonya D.,I love this place!!!! The vibe is warm and inviting and often very busy with the after work crowd. Addicted to their Pad Gra Prow. Seriously. I don't think I've strayed from this dish! But I've also tried Chef Nuit's Pad Thai (YUM) and Khao soi (yum yum!).  Great staff. Definitely one of the best in the city.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Susan G.,"Best Thai food I've ever had. The place is busy, so we were grateful to have had a reservation.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gabriel S.,"Awesome food and a great experience. We sat on the patio with Tyler. Would highly recommend starting with the spring roll appetizer and maybe drinking a Singha Beer. The Pad Gra Prow was so delicous!!! I'm sure any of there food would be excellent, though.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Derrick P.,Best Thai in the city! The staff is amazing and the space is super cozy. All the food is top shelf!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dave S.,A must if you are in Toronto.  The kind of restaurant you wish you had in your city.  Simply amazing!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Diana M.,"Best pad thai in the city..great service, kind of loud and gets really busy but is worth the wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kenny C.,"Pai is probably my favourite restaurant in the area because their food is consistently on point. I usually come here for lunch with my co-workers on Fridays and it's always packed. We've had to leave a few times and find other inferior places to grab lunch because the line was too long. So try to go early or later if you want to beat the lunch crowd. 
    I've had the khao soi, pad thai and the pad gra pow. The Khao Soi is a really flavorful and creamy coconut milk curry with tender chunks of beef and curly egg noodles. I loved it but I wished it came with rice or bread instead of noodles because I wanted something starchy to soak up all the creamy spicy goodness. The Pad Thai is probably the best and most authentic you'll ever find in the GTA. Unlike most other Thai places, their Pad Thai noodles aren't covered in sweet red ketchup sauce. I like to get mine with chicken and shrimp. The shrimps are an extra $2 but it's so worth it - they're huge and succulent.  The Pad Gra Pow is a simple dish of stir-fried minced meat with basil on rice and topped with a sunny side fried egg. It's simple but satisfying. Again, get this with shrimp to bring this dish to another level. Yes, their shrimps are that good. I could just a eat a plate of their shrimps and be happy.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anjel A.,"I haven't tried many Thai places in Toronto, but I was born and raised in Chicago. When it comes to food I'm critical. Pai indeed lives up to my expectations! Taste and quality is amazing. It's reasonable priced especially during lunch hour. I always get my pad Thai with tea ross, but green curry is amazing too!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julia T.,This is my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. It's a very busy restaurant so make sure you make reservations. We've tried to walk in before and were turned away so we've learned to always reserve a table. My favourite menu item is the green curry - it comes in a coconut!!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fred T.,"Best Thai restaurant in town. Friendly staff, awesome food. Perfect blend of flavor & spice.  Their Khao Soi is my favorite dish.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kathleen F.,"The only thing that has been consistent here is their Tom Yum Soup. Not a big fan of their green curry or khao soi. Their pad thai is pretty good if they get your spice level right. All in all, if you like tom yum soup and pad thai, come here. If you like curries, go to Khao San Road.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zhu Q.,"I'm not a big fan of Thai food flavors, but I came here with a group. Something about the spices, curry, and especially hot sauce just doesn't appeal to me. Either way I made the best out of the situation and enjoyed a so-so meal.
The food did take a while to come (about 20 min), probably it was a busy weekend night (in fact we waited 40 minutes to get into the restaurant, but they helpfully let us wander around the city and call us when a table was ready). The waiters helpfully came around about every 20 minutes to check up on our plates and water, and our waiter was super professional and efficient at handling the payment.
The interior decor is quite complete, and the place is dimly lit in very orange light. I was intrigued by the dining section where you could take off your shoes and sit on your legs on cushions.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Clementine M.,"Came here because I had heard this restaurant was opened up by the original chefs of KSR.  Was not disappointed. Very happy for them!
Very busy so make a reservation. Lovely ambiance. Exceptional Thai in the city.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,William W.,"The food would rank about 8/10, although it really helps to know about Korean food beforehand.  The service is friendly and capable.  The atmosphere is funky, very noisy and very crowded; probably better to be young.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jack L.,"As good as everybody has said it is! Nice relaxed vibe, efficient and warm servers/staff. Flavours are authentic and strong, prices are affordable to try different dishes with friends.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patrick D.,"Really fantastic and authentic Thai food.  Went there with a group of 8 people so we ordered many different items from their menu.  Great quality, very fresh and tender chicken, pork and shrimp, all dishes were perfectly seasoned.  Felt like I was in Thailand.  Also, it was a very friendly and relaxed atmosphere.  Much better than Khao San Road.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eugene S.,"excellent, love this place. the food was great and a big fan of the raptor themed cocktails.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shar D.,"This place used to be one of my favourites a few years ago however, it's changed quite a bit due to its growing popularity. If you don't have a reservation, forget about it! I went here on a Thursday night and it was packed as expected. The ambience is still hipster-ish but the music was way too loud (I'm talking next to impossible to have a conversation loud). I ordered the chicken pad thai which I usually do and even though it still tasted delicious, quantity has reduced significantly. I was starving before I got here and was quite disappointed. C'mon Pai, I have faith in you!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brett U.,"Great value and terrific food. It's pretty crowded and loud but hey , that's the atmosphere.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike D.,"This place is always busy, which is a great sign.  I've been here twice now, and my experience both times was extremely positive.  This is likely the best Thai food in the city, as far as I'm concerned.  The Green Coconut Curry is outstanding.  Try their wings appetizer, and you will not be disappointed.  Enjoy your meal with a spiced rum and coke...",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Priya M.,"I've eaten here a few times and it's a pretty nice place for dinner.  The ambiance is fun and the staff is friendly.  There are long wait times and they don't seem to take reservations, so be prepared to wait.  They have some good vegetarian options, however I do find the food can be a bit heavy.  But overall, a fairly good place.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jimmy T.,"Not gonna lie, the food is good...if you are willing to wait for 45mins+. Service is mad slow. I went on a saturday, I know is extra busy but it literally took that long to wait for the food after ordering. 
Maybe the reason the food taste good is because they starve you for a long time so by the time you eat the food, anything will taste amazing.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Annie W.,Really good experience went in with a few friends for a quick bite the service was fast and efficient and the food was great!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christian Q.,A good Thai spot for communal dining. Spread your wings and soar beyond the typical pad Thai or green curry. Rewarding experience.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Greenishhhh G.,"One of my favorite places to eat! I always go for the pad thai, the fritters, tom yum soup and chicken wings. The chicken wings THE BEST I've ever had. One time though, we ordered pad thai and it came out very bland. It was as if there wasn't any sauce on it. I complained and they gave me another one for free(which was good this time) but told me that no one else complained about their Pad Thai that night. Not sure what the waitress was getting at but i think it was unnecessary to say. You could clearly see the first Pad thai we got was dry and pale compared to the second one we got.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,CARA H.,"Went for the first time on a Thursday. It was busy so we ate at the bar. The food was delicious and very flavourful. We ordered everything Thai spicy (we love very spicy food) but they punched it in wrong and everything came mild. It was delicious but with the spice I know would have been that much better for us. A little bit of a bummer 
Went today for take out as I had a craving...ordered my food and asked for it Thai spicy and one medium. Got there and she assured me one was medium the other mild. I asked them to remake the mild dish as this happened last time. I am now at home about to dive into this food and realized the medium dish is mild....again to disappoint after I waited and confirmed 
They would get 5 stars if it weren't for their lack of clarity. The food really is great and atmosphere is awesome highly recommended just make sure you clarify (maybe a few times) the spice level..",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,ken c.,Terrible Thai food. Too salty and lack of flavours. Not to mention it is over priced. Not even close to real Thai food.    Even Salad King offers better Thai food. Long wait for table. Don't go there.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James S.,Awesome. Perfectly spiced. Squash fritters were great. Gaeng masaman was some great curry.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ajax W.,"This right here is what Thai cuisine in Toronto is all about. As much as my bank account will allow, Pai is my go to spot for late night delivery. Seeing as its usually fully booked, my desire for delectable Thai food supersedes my ability to withstand crowds which always results in my sitting naked at home, ordering a $100 worth of Thai food. There ability to infuse the correct flavours in their dishes is unappalled as by the time the food is delivered its been sitting cold, yet somehow still tastes better than any Thai spot across the GTA. Chicken Satay Skewers are nuts, the Thom Yum Gong soup is exactly on point, and their fried fish is addictively flavourful. Trust me, that fried fish is a game changer. Everything about the food is 5 stars, but I have yet to eat in the actual restaurant so I cannot attest to the service, BUT i am positive they're dynamite people because they make bomb ass food. Minus 1 star for the pricing, Thai street food is originally cheap so its pretty gut wrenching spending $8 on chicken skewers. Still, I'm willing to go through many more heart-breaking monetary decisions to get proper Thai food.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Shanker N.,"Best Thai in town. Masaman is unbelievable. The oxtail is surreal. If you can handle the wait, it will be a delightful experience. This is a no brainer. Go for it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kevin S.,got the pad thai and green curry. came in a coconut which was cool. extracted coconut jelly from it. service was slow. atmosphere was nice. will come back for sticky rice.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Margaret W.,"Worst service ever! Sat down and waited 45 minutes for a server to get to my table or even give me a glass of water. Keep in mind the server walked past our table numerous times and looked at us...
Food was not good. Chicken wings were the only good thing. The satay chicken had no flavour - so bland. 
The pad thai was just like any other pad thai out there. 
All in all, would not go back. Would rather go to salad king for cheaper and better.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,S G.,"Delicious! Great food, great atmosphere and great drinks. I love thai food and this is one of my favourites. I am never disappointed. This is one of those places I love taking other people to, whether it is my parents or some friends. My favourite dishes would be the squash fritters, chef nuit pad thai and the coconut green curry.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lara P.,"Came here on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm with 4 people without a reservation - I think we got lucky because it only took 15 minutes to seat us. The place is pretty big and it was packed. I would recommend making a reservation unless you can wait 15-45 minutes for a table.
Food is 4/5
- started with the spring rolls, grabong (squash fritters), starter Tom Yum soup - everything was yummy
- Pad Thai was simple and well-made
- Khao Soi (noodles in golden curry) - rich and delicious! Could be shared between 2 people especially if you had appetizers to start. Beware if you're wearing white: it's saucy and may splash onto your clothes
- Gaeng Masaman with braised beef - hearty beef stew with hint of curry
- Khao Pla Tawt (Basa Fillet) - the fish was breaded and was cooked well. The chili sauce that came on the side was extremely spicy
- they have one dessert: mango on sticky rice which was nice and well-made but not for everyone
- I didn't try the cocktails as I found them to be a bit over-priced ($11 to $13) considering there are some great cocktail bars in Toronto serving higher quality cocktails at around the same price
-plates can be shared or eaten separately
Service was 4/5 - service was friendly and considering how busy it was, the food came out fairly quickly
If you're looking for desserts or cocktails, I would recommend sharing a few plates here for your main meal and going to another place for dessert/drinks.
I would recommend this place for 4 people. There were also tables for 6-8 people. It has a fun, loud and casual atmosphere and the food is reasonably priced. I would recommend to anyone looking for Thai food in Toronto.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Michael J.,"When I went here it was pretty traditional Thai food, It was alright but unfortunately for them, I'm a very picky eater and didn't think that the staff did enough to ensure that I enjoyed my meal properly. This place needs improvement but its not terrible.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Om N.,The best Thai food in Toronto.... Their Massaman Beef is a dream.  Totally worth the wait - just grab a cocktail and watch the hustle and bustle.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ha T.,"This place is the real deal!
This was my first time eating Thai food so I did not know what to expect and what to order.  Good thing the staff was so helpful!  We were seated at the bar and the bartender was so nice and helpful.  He guided us through the menu and recommended what we should eat.  He did not have to do that but it was really nice of him to make suggestions.  We had the grabong (deep fried battered squash fritters) and pad gra prow (rice with chicken and an egg).  It was so good!
Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.  I did not want to wait in line at first but it was so worth it!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mike R.,"Excellent meal. Very fresh ingredients, prepared to perfection. Staff did a great job, from the beginning to the end. No complaints whatsoever, and no recommendation for how they could make it better.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Josh P.,Holy Cow is this place good! The Thai Iced Tea is fantastic. If you're coming for lunch you should probably arrive before 12 as the line was put the door by 12:10. Not sure if they take reservations or not.... Everything I've tried on the menu has been great,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stephanie A.,Love Pai! My favourite place over Khao- less waits and less chaotic. I love their hot and sour soup!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mark J.,"This place was hopping - and very LOUD (my only complaint). The place really was jamming at 6:30 PM when I arrived. I was greeted promptly and seated right away at the bar. The service was prompt and friendly, the food was delicious and reasonably priced. I will definitely eat here again next time I'm in Toronto!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jin K.,"I've been here 3 times, 2 for dinner and 1 for lunch. The 2 times I came here for dinner was amazing. Their Pad Thai is so good, I can't stop thinking about it. However, I came here for lunch once and it was very disappointing. The noodles were all clumped together, no flavour, I guess maybe it was just that day. I'll definitely give it one more try though.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura F.,"Pretty good, although I have to say I prefer Khao San Road. Wasn't a big fan of having cauliflower in my pad thai. Would definitely like to come back to try other stuff though!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aaa Y.,"Expect about a 40-minute wait without a reservation. If you get a chance, order the green curry served in a coconut. Definitely a must-try! It's probably one of the best Thai green curries I've ever had. Love the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant (definitely adds to the experience).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,K L.,"Yum!  Since the opening of Pai, I no longer go to KSR.  The vibe here is so much more chill and the servers are incredibly nice!  The food is delicious and their dessert, coconut rice with mango is incredible.  They also have more selection to their regular menu.  Their morning glory app is incredible.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Taylor G.,"Update: We finally had the chance to actually dine in. I've tried to get reservations, but there's never availability. We decided to drop in around 6:30pm on a Friday and they said it was about a 40 minute wait. I think we got there just in time because a line started to form behind us. We started with the Grabong, get it! So good. We ordered the chef nuit pad thai and Gaeng Masaman with braised beef, which were both amazing. Again the portions are huge so we took home leftovers. I also found the prices to be really reasonable. All that food plus 2 beers came to $66!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,. ..,"Fresh flavours, authentic tasting food in a laid back atmosphere. I always get the pad thai and really enjoy the green curry. I'm sure I'm missing out on the rest of the menu which also looks delicious.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sabina K.,"Love this place, one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto so far. Their mango sticky rice (dessert) is probably the best I've had in Toronto and GTA. But the line-up is almost impossible to avoid .. Also not great if you're trying to catch up with a friend because it is quite loud.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dave T.,"I finally got to try out Pai and overall the experience was good.
The Good.
- I booked an office lunch for 15 people and they were accommodating. The woman on the phone put me on hold and then came back to explain that they'll give me the reservation even though they wouldn't usually do so given the size of our party and the time. 
- The food was delicious. Everyone in my group has never heard of this place (or Sukothai, Khao San Road) so they were blown away.
The Not-So-Good.
- The food did not come all at once. One member of our party did not get her meal until almost all of us were done. That wasn't a big deal as mistakes happen. I was more concerned how they handled it. They were very apologetic and gave the our party member a free desert, which was good, but they didn't comp her meal. To me, this resolution was half complete.
- The other thing was they wouldn't give us separate bills or break down what each individual owed. One member of our party made mention to this and complained how it was a hassle. The waitress politely said how they don't do that and my party was warned before and after arrival that they don't do that. I get the point, but ultimately, this is not a good customer experience. We all had to whip out our calculators. Since 20% gratuity is already added automatically, this added to the confusion because some people were adding a tip and then being told gratuity is included and they had to re-calculate. 
Overall, the Not-So-Goods are the reason why this is a 4/5 and not a 5/5. In the end, it's about the customer experience, not what was warned or not.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zein A.,"Every time I come here I know exactly what to expect, and I'm never disappointed. The food is great, their coconut milk curry is delicious, so flavourful but also very simple. Staff are nice, prices are good, and overall I highly recommend the place for a casual lunch or dinner.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stefanie D.,"Love this place! Honestly, the BEST Thai food in the city. Cool, funky atmosphere, excellent dishes. It's so nice to see the former team from Khao San Road continue in yet another highly successful venture. I cannot rave about this place enough - from the atmosphere, to the music, great staff and stellar food, everything is completely on-par and top notch. I will keep coming back and this is truly my only go-to thai restaurant (other than Sukho-Thai) in the city.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tracy L.,"First time here and the thai food is quite delicious and authentic! I had the beef noodle soup with the brisket. It was the perfect broth with fresh herbs. My sister had the green curry served in a coconut. We as a group had the fritters, beef salad and papaya salad as apps. The papaya salad was my favourite with the sauce to content mix. The atmosphere is rustic and warm. It's on the lower level of a building. When we went around 5 we just missed the dinner rush. Just an hr in, the restaurant is full and vibrant. The wait staff were super nice and helpful with the menu questions. Another bonus is there was a phone charging station for your phone.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sumantra D.,Gets a bit noisy but the masseman beef and the Khao Soy make it worth it!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Klara D.,"I don't normally like thai food; peanut and oyster sauces are not appetizing to me, and neither is pad thai because I don't like my noodles to be mushy. BUT. Pai Northern Thai Kitchen has AMAZING food. I had the green curry, which comes in a coconut. I had it mild, and it was a good amount of spice for me. My boyfriend got a soup with peanut based broth and beef in it, and I really liked his food too. The chicken satay skewers were really tender, and not tough at all. It's  nice atmosphere as well. Our server was nice, and Peter at the bar is great. Highly recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ottmf P.,"So you think you like spicy, you got the stomach to handle it?  Pack a bag and come see Ron, they will leave to crying and praying for ice cream later.  Get the antacid and come over!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jinelle S.,"SOOO good! If you're gluten-free, though, remember that even though it says items can be made gluten-free, that you have to request that to be done. They do not come automatically that way, always. Will return.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,fernando r.,"This place is so good that it is ridiculous. Authentic, quaint, and with the best service. Every item in the menu is fabulous. Worth my two hour drive from Buffalo. That is all I need to say, really. Come early. It gets packed. That is the only drawback. There is a host that has no personality, but the waitstaff is fantastic and friendly. 5 stars all the way, despite the jerk host.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jen H.,"After hearing everyone rave about this place as the Khao San Road but with a shorter line, I finally agreed to go along with some friends one night. Since then, I've been back a few times but its still not one of my go-to spots in Toronto. In fairness, I'm not huge on Thai food but I thought the pad thai was reasonably good, but nothing mind blowing or particularly unique in my opinion. I'm happy to join friends here when they choose the place as the food is always solid, service is consistent and the restaurant has a nice, overly casual vibe. If you really need a Thai food fix I would come here over Khao San Road purely to avoid the lineups.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Julie H.,The service is fantastic and the Kao Soi is one of the best things I've ever eaten hands-down. Get it with braised beef. It just fell apart. The pickles and lime add just the right acidic bite. The Thai iced tea was a nice touch as well. The perfect meal.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bob S.,Very good green curry! The coconut milk really brought out the flavours. Did not like the mandatory 20% tip!,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carina H.,"Came here for lunch to try some Thai food and it was pretty good. The design and layout of menu is very cute, artistic, and cartoonish - as if it was drawn and coloured with pencil crayon and marker lol. I normally order the Red Penang curry, but after looking at all the delicious menu items decided to try the Green Curry chicken instead, and it was pretty good. The Green Curry was authentic tasting and delicious. You can choose between mild and spicy. The Green Curry sauce is served in a small bowl with a separate bowl for rice. The Green Curry sauce was creamy and coconutty. I especially liked the decor as well because it had a nice Thailand feel to it. The back counter is decorated like a Thai street food market with blue/white tarps and hanging bananas. The service I would say is slower but definitely worth the wait. Definitely another great spot in Toronto for Thai food!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Souhail E.,They will put items in your plate that are not on the menu so if you have allergies or dietary restrictions you'd better  ask about every item on your plate to know what it is. This is poor service,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Eddy L.,Pai is a busy energetic Thai place in the entertainment district. Very casual but the food is delicious and service is fast and cheerful. Reservations are a good idea. There is a good selection of beer and wine as well as non alcoholic drinks. Nice spot for tasty food and energetic clientele. Prices are very reasonable considering location and popularity. Fun place for a group to go for a good time.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ada T.,"My fav thai place with another location! Less busy / more space, food that is on par with the other sukhothai locations but with more variety, and friendly staff. Loved the ox tail curry, papaya salad, and the mango sticky rice",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anushka K.,Amazing amazing amazing! Walked in and had to wait 20mins for a table. Went to the bar across the street in the meantime. Squash fritters are to die for!!! Had the Khao Soi with chicken- chicken melted in my mouth. Hands down the best Thai food I've ever eaten,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adam P.,"Khoi Soi was unbelievably delicious but salty. Can't say enough good things about their menu. Very inexpensive for what it is, especially considering its downtown location.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mia M.,Amazing ambience. Looks great on the inside. Tried the satay chicken and Chef Nuit Pad Thai with shrimps in super spicy (level 4 I think). We got there and there was no line-up. It was a Sunday at around 5. Line-up started just a few minutes after we got there. Service was great too. Didn't wait long for the food even though the place was packed.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jarrell J.,This is the best Thai food i ever had in my life must go there and eat they have a waiting area that has a bar that serves drinks until your table ready . Watch your step on the way in.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Stanoi K.,"Super jam-packed excitable lunch crowd on a sunny Thursday afternoon. Our table for 5 got in ten minutes before 12 and in a blink of an eye there was only bar-seating left and the basement volume was kickin'.
I ordered the shrimp pad thai and was fully satisfied that the noodles didn't stick to each other and the sauce was more sweet than savoury compared to what I expected from the dish.
A fellow diner ordered the panang beef curry and I think I liked that dish even more than my own just from a little taste.
Don't come here for a quiet date, it ain't the right mood for that sort of thing.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenn T.,"This place is delicious!! Although the pad thai isn't as good as Khao San Road, it still good. I really enjoyed the appetizers here. We had Som Tum Tad (papaya salad), Plah Nua (beef salad), laap salad and squash fritters. I must say that I enjoyed the appetizers so much that I would come back just for them and skip the main dishes. However, the Pad Gra Prow was really good. I haven't tried this dish anywhere else but this would be my go-to main dish and the appetizers are a must! Mainly the papaya salad, beef salad and laap salad as the squash fritters are pretty much the same everywhere.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tracy N.,Perfect yummy Thai food. Love the food here especially the Pra Grow crispy pork rice dish.  They also have a take out counter at the back of the restaurant with daily specials and limited seating! Will be back to try that out next time.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Daniela G.,"Amazing thai food. The Pad thai is excellent and the kao soi was really good as well. 
The  atmosphere is great and the service was good.
Went there Saturday night and the wait time was short. 
If you like Khao San Road, you're going to love this one!!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Amanda R.,Good authentic Thai food. Not fast food. Gets packed and busy. Delivery and take out is good too,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Fred I.,"This restaurant is very good but loud.  Best dish was the green curry.  The soup went cold quickly because of the way it was served in a circular aluminum dish with no heat below the empty central portion of  it.  The papaya salad was not, for the most part, papaya.  The Isaan sausage missed the tang I expected.  The Pad Thai was pretty good but I have had better.  We did not order the Khao Soi, which is one of the two chef's signature dishes along with Chef Nuit's Pad Thai.  Service was very good in the context of a Thai street food restaurant.  Food was four star, dining experience was two star, because all of the dishes we ordered were dumped on our table at the same time and the soup went cold before we could finish it.  Thus, the three-star rating.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Anu S.,Cozy place with good food... Staff is friendly and the service is quick.. what more to ask :),4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,J L.,One of my favourite Thai restaurants. My go-to dishes include Khao Soi and Pad Gra Prow. This restaurant can get busy so be sure to make a reservation or go early. Has a very relaxed and casual ambience. Don't forget to try their Thai Ice Tea!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jennifer R.,"Do yourself a favour. Go! Don't worry about the line up, service is fast and friendly, you'll be seated in no time. Don't skip dessert!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M C.,"Doesn't look like much on the outside, but the food is truly outstanding.  We had the coconut curry with shrimp and some kind of fried rice dish, and both were great.  Highly recommend this restaurant.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alexis P.,"My mother and I walked in before catching a show at the Royal Alexander. They weren't taking reservations but since our party was small, we had no wait time. Fabulous service from all working there. The food was delicious, I had the Kaoh Pla Tawt and my mom had the chicken phad  thai. Would definitely go back again.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelly S.,"Was there with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago for lunch. Service was pretty terrible, we couldn't really tell who our server was but the food really saved the day. Everything was amazing and perfect for sharing. So full neither of us could move but we could get enough. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu but the fried rice with crispy pork was our favourite.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bartholemew S.,"I hope they keep they rename the amir johnson gin drink! So minty.. so fresh.. so good!
Night market is amazing at the end of the month so make sure you go.  Go early though as it gets BUSY.  
Pros
They text you if it's super busy. Leave your # and they'll tell your when your table is ready.
Good thai food - I got the coconut thing
Cons:
My coconut was way smaller than other peoples. (Seriously it seems like the food is based on coconut size!) -.5
Gets super busy",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tommy O.,Great lunch but often a busy place. Need to show up right at noon or else stay in line.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rana B.,I think I've had every dish on this menu and everything is absolutely delicious! Fresh and flavourful. Ambience is fun and lively with good music. Absolute crave worthy!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Carol C.,Really solid Thai food - the flavours are amazing and the portion sizes are just right.  Be sure to make a reservation because the wait can be pretty long to get a table!  Ambiance-wise...the restaurant is a bit on the dark side and can get pretty loud.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jay B.,Ignore my below post. This got posted in the wrong restaurant. This restaurant is actually pretty good.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Louanne W.,"Great atmosphere, great food, great service, great drinks (cucumber collins is amazing) and great prices. We came for dinner at 6pm on a Saturday night and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, which isn't bad at all. By 7pm, the line up was out the door so come early. We ordered the Pad Da Grao and some brisket curry with potatoes (can't remember what it was called). Everything was amazing and we'll definitely be coming back.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa W.,"Perfect Thai Curry in nice easy going atmosphere, portions are reasonable, great service, not really any desserts available.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jacquelyn I.,"My husband and I went to Pai while visiting Toronto from the states for a few days for our wedding anniversary on the recommendation of one of the bartenders at Barhop. We had the shrimp thamada and it was incredible. Mike (manager?) talked with us for about 20 minutes about the history, the food, and other food recommendations in the city. He was super nice. We liked it so much we decided to back for our anniversary dinner a couple days later. We of course had the shrimp thamada again, and the shrimp curry served in a coconut. Again, incredible. The cocktails were super tasty. I loved the summer dog with lychee juice. The only negative is that we'll have to drive 5.5 hours to have it again!!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,L L.,The food is awesome and the space is quite unique and roomy. I'm just shy of giving it 5 stars because the service is a bit slow.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Christopher C.,We got the spring rolls and the fried squash to start and it was good. Lots of flavour and the dipping sauces were great. We also go the Thai Bucket drink which didn't have much alcohol considering it costs $27. Most of us got the pad Thai because of the great reviews. Unfortunately it wasn't what we expected. We all thought it was too sweet for our liking. Although we did like the pad Thai it did not meet our expectations. Most likely won't go back considering all the other Thai options I the city.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kazi R.,"Loved this place, food is exactly like khao san road. Hard to distinguish except for the atmosphere and sitting arrangement. The place is more lively. Pad ga prao is a must try.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M W.,"Best thai food in the city! 
Cool vibe. Always busy. 
Favourite items:
-Tom Yum soup
-Gaeng Masaman with braised beef",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lior K.,"Great experience at this restaurant, a few errors by the waitress but overall food is really good and I'm happy we popped by. Will definitely be back. Gets a little crowded but worth the wait.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cathy K.,"Ditto to all the great reviews . Love this place, love that it is run by some same staff from Khao San Road. Food is wonderful. We always try to get there early ( by 5:30pm ) to avoid the huge line up. This is our go-to restaurant for great Thai food and a wonderful dinner experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jenn O.,"Pai has a bustling environment and great decor, with food to match.  The papaya salad was delicious and had a unique presentation with dried shrimp, and the pad gra pow was amazing.  The service was good, my only reservation being that the restaurant provides a fork and knife by default.  Although they provide chopsticks on request, it distracts from the restaurant's overall vibe.  It's a perfect place for a fun, uplifting lunch.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Finetune F.,When it comes to authentic Northern Thai food this place is probably the closest. The service was average since it was really packed. But the servers were able to sufficiently satisfy our table.  The food quality was above average since very few northern thai restaurants exist in the GTA. Definitely looking forward to my next visit.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Byron C.,So so many people waiting in line to be serviced for tables.  The price is reasonable and food is just ok. Feels like a bar with noisy music.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Bob G.,Incredible atmosphere in the basement last night.  Service was top notch.  But the food wow cooked to perfection.  Overall the best Thai restaurant in either US or Canada that I have been to. Not sure how they do it for the prices they charge.  Only improvement I could suggest is a bigger bar area and place to manage lineup.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Just Wanna E.,"Ended up here a few times when Khao San Road had a somewhat lengthy waiting list. Each time, I ended up saying to myself, ""Should have waited instead.""
This place is good. Not great. But good. You know that guy who consistently places second to Usain Bolt, and is also Jamaican? No? Well, I don't know his name either, but look him up. Pai is like that guy. Pai is like the Pippen to KSR's Jordan.
Whenever it's busy, and this has happened to me like 3 times now, the waitresses try to push you to order something that they've obviously made in bulk quantities and have ready-to-splatter on a plate of jasmine rice. When I try to order my original-intended dish instead, they try to sell me again, as if I couldn't get through their slight accent the first time. I'm happy to wait, but I get the sense they're extremely embarrassed to ask me to wait 30-40 minutes. 
Aside from the fact that there are lengthy waits, and that the place is somewhat understaffed, the food is actually not bad. If you are averse to the more flavorful varieties of Thai food, you may actually prefer this place to other Thai restaurants nearby.
The Thai iced tea here gets pummelled by KSR though.
The only saving grace is that they take reservations. At the same time, it's infuriating to see large tables, for 4 - 8, open for 40 - 50 minute at a time when their bench for waitlisters is full and the lobby has become standing-room only.
The food itself, taken alone, is again.. not bad.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Aimee T.,Absolutely phenomenal! Best Thai food I've ever had. The spring rolls had incredible flavor and the dipping sauce was divine. I had khao soi which was fantastic!! Will for sure eat here again my next visit to Toronto.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Margaux C.,"Amazing food for amazing value - my boyfriend and I absolutely love this place. Props to the chef Nuit Regular for bringing her A-game to this restaurant. If you like Thai food this is the place to go! And if you aren't sure about Thai, try this and you'll learn you love it (most North American Thai food doesn't even come close to this).",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashna H.,Best Thai restaurant in Toronto downtown i really liked the food very well balanced in test and very cozy and the staff very friendly,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,S. S.,"The spring rolls were a delicious starter.  I had the Pad Gra Prow with chicken as my main and it was pretty yummy.  However, I just wish the fried egg on top was a tiny bit less cooked.  It would have been perfect if it had been just slightly runny when I cut into it.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dima P.,"Fantastic food, the best Thai I've had in Toronto so far!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Katy H.,"We've eaten at Pai quite a few times (because the food is so damn good!) and we actually decided to host our wedding rehearsal dinner there. JJ and the team at Pai were so accommodating and made the night special and unique. As usual the food was delicious, all our guests were impressed, the private dining room was immaculate and they even let us bring our own flowers and decor to make the room our own. Prices, service, private dining and food all A+++.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kenneth T.,"Massaman beef or lamb curry, green chicken curry, thai basil spicey noodles - all great. Careful with the chilis, this is the real deal. Do not order ""Thai spicey"" unless you know what you're doing - i.e. you have lived, truely lived (not traveled or 'backpacked') in Thailand outside of Bangkok.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ivy D.,"Food: 6/10
Atmosphere: 8/10 
Service:2/10
Food was good but nothing special. Ambiance is great! Service was slow and pretty much non existent. Over 30 minutes for food after we've order is unacceptable. Chicken pad Thai was better than most places but the noodles were over cooked. The laap salad wasn't flavorful enough. The Chang Mai beef noodle soup was good but not enough to make me want to come back. If I were to ever go back it would be just for the atmosphere and drinks.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patricia H.,Came here two weeks ago. This place is incredible. The food was perfectly salted (I am very particular and many Thai restaurants over salt). The young coconuts were a real treat. Wish I found this place sooner.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Concepts E.,"An unusual hipster experience not always associated with a Thai restaurant. The staff were very attentive, courteous, and pleasant. I like that they take reservations. Portion sizes were good as well. We ordered 3 dishes between the 3 of us and shared comfortably. 
Medium heat in the pad Thai is not that spicy. Manageable but not too much heat. The mango drink is very refreshing as the weather warms up. 
My only criticism really is with the price point. My friends and I have tried Thai food in many cities and even in Thailand - but pad Thai for $14 is a bit much. Not to mention green curry at $16.
Take a moment to soak in the ambience with so many details to soak in!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patrick C.,"Excellent Thai food, the servers are excellent and explain all the different dishes. I had the green curry which was very very nice. I will definitely be back. The atmosphere was great and it was packed, we very lucky to get a table.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kate C.,Best fucking food. Quick. Great music. If you're questioning whether to come here or not you better be on your way. It's wonderful.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Moonbler C.,Delicious! Love the food and atmosphere! We ordered Green Curry beef and Shrimp Pad Thai. Great value and fast service too! We are delighted!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M T.,Food is fresh and delicious. Been here a few times and continue to go back. Drinks are reasonable. Service is courteous and speedy. I would recommend getting their early for lunch (11:45) otherwise you'll be waiting for a table.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M C.,Had the veggie Pad Thai.  I enjoyed the food and atmosphere a lot more than Khao San Road,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Xiny L.,Tried Pad Thai and Thai Tea. the environment reminds Thailand~,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Zooey B.,"it's a place where u can drink and eat Thai food. Very good atmosphere, food is great.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,M S.,"Been there. Good Thai food form the people of Suko Tahi. Too crowded. Unable to find reservations. Disappointed many times, though I go to TIFF weekly.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David Z.,"We waited 50 min for our food today, which was out of the ordinary. But the owner apologized and offered a discount so I'm willing to come back and try again.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kathleen L.,its good food service was quick and they care about customer reasonable price and taste good & strong defiantly,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew Y.,Extremely great food! Only took about 1.5 hours to be seated. Worth the wait but be amazed by the food. Americans-be prepped because the reservations uses phone numbers to let them know the table is ready. You may have to wait at the restaurant for your table.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tiger D.,"Wow. Talk about authentic Thai food. We got to sit in their sofa area and it was quite the experience. The pad thai was spot on with the sweetness and flavor. Their curry was creamy but still had that kick to it. Overall, for the amount of money you pay, you definitely get your food's worth. Would definitely recommend.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Brian F.,"Just ate here a couple of days ago, and it is my new favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto...  Having tried all of chef Nuit's restos, I would rank them such:  1) Pai; 2) Khao San Road; 3) Sabai Sabai and Sukho tied... This is based on a combination of factors, including taste, decor, ambiance, location, and value for money.  I can only imagine how Pai will distance itself from the rest once their liquor licence is in place!  
No, this and KSR are not for dates (too noisy), and you will have to avoid the swarm of suits decending from the business district, but the cool, kitschy decor and delicious menu make up for it, AND they have a patio!  Some favourites from KSR are on the new menu here, but clay pot dishes like the Gaeng Hung Lay, with its rich, thick gravy blanketing either pork belly or oxtail were amazing!  The salad app was beautifully plated, as was a curry that I saw presented inside a coconut at the table next to us...
I am deducting one star only because, despite the plethora of beer signs and an entire page of alcohol in the menu, they didn't have their liquor licence in order yet, and we couldn't have a cold beer with this delicious Thai food!  However, their juices were a delicious option!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Party P.,Great place to grab lunch. I've managed to sneak in during peak hours somehow! Chef's pad thai has a nice amount of cilantro flavour and a subtle street-style pad thai sauce. Beware of the potent curries if you are sensitive to spice / have stomach acid issues. I can handle a sriracha level amount of spice but the beef curry I had was a bit more intense than that.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Foodie T.,"Frankly speaking - having been to Chef Nuit's other restaurant, my expectation for this restaurant is very high and sure enough Pai delivered. The food execution (we ordered Pad Thai and Pad ga prow) was flawless with all the taste hitting its mark and cooking is just superb. As always, it brought us back to Thailand figuratively speaking. 
Service despite being very very busy is also very friendly, welcoming yet efficient at the same time. Food arrives promptly - the server checks on us regularly and the bill comes promptly too. Reservation few days in advance is highly recommended. 
So why not five star? One minor thing - we found that the portion size for the appetizer (satay) was too small for its price and the main was just a tad smaller as well. Maybe it's just me that used to a tad larger portion size in the other establishment (Khao San I recall has bigger portion size and even Suko-thai)
Definitely a fan!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emma Q.,"Had a mild pad gra prow with egg for lunch, good portion and balance between rice and toppings. Their food definitely tasted different than other Thai food that I've tried previously. Will come back for more! 
Not a 5 star rating because music is too loud, I am a soft speaker and I had to try really hard to speak up that my throat hurts after; and it's not accessible for people in wheelchairs using the front entrance, there's a flight of stairs that you need to get down.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Angela M.,"So the food here is great... when it actually gets to you. This is the second time that I've ordered from here and they haven't brought me my full order. The first time they at least provided me with the courtesy of a phone call and offered me a credit for the next time I called in (which, btw, I've never actually gotten).
This time when my meal arrived, I got a note taped to the bag telling me that they were out of one of the items I had ordered, and would credit me back on my credit card and call me when this happened. This was awful as we had ordered enough food for three people, and only enough for two people showed up - had they actually taken the time to provide us with a courtesy call, we could have ordered something else. 
Also, they never called me to refund me the money. I had to follow up twice - the first time I called, the girl on the phone was rude and told me rather flippantly that 'her manager would get around to it at the end of the night'. When I just called now trying to explain the situation, the man on the phone cut me off mid sentence to try to explain what happened, and didn't even bother to offer me any sort of anything as an apology. Not cool. 
Wherein before I would highly recommend this place, will definitely be doing the opposite from herein when people ask me about what Thai to order in the city. A shame too as their food is good - too bad their service, and general regard for the customer, stink.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Song K.,Chef Nuit Regular... you make real Thai food like no other Thai restaurant in Toronto. Tried Khao San on 11 Charlotte street and I'm never going back. Please please never change the recipe to your dishes.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joletta L.,This is my go to when someone asks for a great place to eat thai food. I work around the corner at a hotel and when guests ask for a hip place to eat at. This is it.  The quality of food is amazing and the flavour is almost quite similar to real thai food. I've been to thailand and the noodles are spot on. The only downfall is that you cannot make reservations and are only on a first come first serve basis. It's almost always busy and quite noisy. But that's the atmosphere they're going for especially having a bar. Limited menu but excellent food.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Flylink L.,woow best tasty food when I arrive that restaurant I feel very attractive that food like mouth-watering,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Renata H.,"Had the Khao Soi, a coconut drink, and the mango sticky rice dessert. Enjoyed everything!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marcy T.,Love this place! The vibe is very cool and the food is so authentic.  Always busy so make a reservation!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Courtney E.,This place is great! Really good chicken fried rice and tasty Khao soi!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ikram G.,"Super good food!!!!!!! We loved it, reminds us Thailand. We felt like we were in the country with the food and decoration in the place. Will go back definitively. Just a little bit crowdy and noisy",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marie A.,"Great authentic Thai food. Kao Soi Gai is my favorite. And Som Tam salad. A bit pricey, but great atmosphere and service. Worth it.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Frances X.,"We went on a Wednesday after work. The place was very loud and the average crowd was young , less than 30. We ordered popular dishes like green curry, pad Thai , spring rolls and Miang Kung. The pat Thai was really good but everything else was just ok. Starter portion was very small. Miang Kung was interesting in terms of presentation and flavour but that's all. With two beer and a Thai iced tea, our bill was over 80 dollars before tax and tips. I don't really like the deco either which is like a street market setting. There was a Thai rice packaging hanging on the wall outside the washrooms as decoration. If you don't read Thai or Chinese, it might feel exotic or interesting, but not to me. In a nut shell, this place is loud, food is okay. Cheap deco but not with cheap food.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kel M.,"Love this place. Authentic, fresh and delicious. Don't miss the Pad Thai or Green Curry.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Glenn P.,"Like a trip to Thailand, I found this hidden place on my way to somewhere else, Hands Down it's the best Authentic Thai restaurant in Toronto.   Food is not over spiced, reasonably priced and delicious.  Their Thai staff is friendly, courteous and knowledgeable about the dishes served. It does get quite busy so a reservation if highly recommended.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Smrithi P.,"Good food and good energy in this place. Crowded during peak times, plan to wait and you will not regret it.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Racine S.,"I've ordered take out here twice and aside from the long waiting time (45 mins for 1 dish), I love their Beef Khao Pad!!!! So yummy :) will definitely stop by again!!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Luisa A.,"The food is insanely good! The Khao soi is amazing, as is the pad thai, which you can't go wrong with. It's not overly sweet, just the right kind of savoury, and it keeps you coming back some more! Definitely one of my favourite Thai places in Toronto.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,D C.,"Another Thai restaurant open up in Entertainment District, owners from Sukho Thai and Gusto 101. It is hidden in the basement, the décor is like abandon factory with old relics, wooden chairs and tables. We've made reservations and luckily we were able to get our table pretty quickly. The place was packed with the dinner crowd, it's pretty noisy in there and lots of people traffic walking around.
We first had the papaya salad with salted crab. When we ordered it, we thought we would get pieces of crab. When the plate came, we were searching really hard for the crab and couldn't see any. As we dig into the papaya salad, we found little pieces of crab shell and that was is. It was suppose to be only there for flavouring and no crab meat. Boo. The salad was made from green papaya, it is hard like a cabbage, not the orange papaya. I wasn't a fan, it was served on a big plate with a few shrimp chips and vermicelli, the papaya salad was piled as a small tower in the centre but not much to eat. Not worth the $12.
After the salad, our food took  pretty long before it came. But when it came, all the dishes came at the same time. We ordered 3 mains as recommendation from the server. Chicken pad thai ($14) - this was my favourite out of the dishes. The homemade tamarind sauce was excellent, not like the other ""fake"" pad thai which tastes like ketchup. The noodles was stir fried just right, not mushy or too hard. Next dish was Gaeng Hunglay ($15) - sweet & sour curry with ox tail served with rice. It was served in a clay pot which was interesting. If it was served on a stove and bubbling as well, that would be cool. The ox tail has been cooked to tender, the meat is very soft and falls off the bone. The sweet and sour curry was good but I still prefer the golden curry. Final dish was Pad Gra Prow ($15) - famous street food in Thailand. Stir fried ground meat with basil served on rice and topped with a thai style fried egg with pork belly. The pork belly was crispy, not just the skin but the meat part as well. It was very tasty. The egg with the ground meat on rice was original, not that special so the pork belly made the difference.
We were all pretty full from all the food between the 4 of us. The service was good when the serve finally comes to our table. It's too busy and hard to get anybody's attention here.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ines R.,"I love pad thai and the first time I came to Pai I greatly enjoyed it, but the past 2 times I've been here the service has been really slow, and when I requested no coriander on the dishes they ignored my request.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Elaine D.,"Absolutely amazing. Long line wait (for 6 people though) but so worth it. The host was very organized when seating tables. Cannot say enough good things about the masaman curry, tasted just like Thailand! Ended the meal with mango curry which was also delicious!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patrick M.,"Easily a 5 star if the service was as incredible as the food. Curry served in a coconut with chicken was everything you'd expect and want from a Thai restaurant. Had medium heat with that which was just right for those that like some spice, but still enjoy their dish without sweating. Another dish that is an absolute must is the staff's favourite pick. With crispy pork or beef, this dish is the reason why I will be returning and waiting to eat at Pai again. Besides slow service, servers were nice and the bartenders were great as well. The atmosphere is great inside, call and reserve a table a week in advance or get there on the earlier side of dinner time.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,David B.,Pretty decent food. would go back again. The staff were nice and the price was reasonable. overall am happy and would come back,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nicole V.,"I got the Beef pad thai and lemongrass drink. Really like the lemongrass drink, very refreshing in the summer.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,JD R.,"Perfect dinner.  At least as good as anything I've eaten in Thailand.  Pad Gra Prow with Moo Grab (pork belly) was out of this world.  Reservations not taken for the same day; wait time on a rainy Friday night (during a Blue Jays game) was about 15 minutes. Friendly, precise service. Delicious food. Decent prices (about CAD 15 / main course). Outstanding!",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily L.,"We use Pai to cater our office lunches and they're great. Their troughs of food almost always come on time or early, and their catering options are definitely worth the price. Always enough to share and always enough flavor to spice up our regular sandwiches or salad options.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura L.,"Pai and the associated restaurants are the best spots for real authentic Thai food. I haven't had a bad meal. My faves are the Pad Gra Prow, Chiang Mai Noodle Soup, Satay, Squash Fritters. These are the original group of people from the original Khao San Road (before the split) and Sukho Thai. All amazing and never disappoints. I recommend making reservations or walk in on a non peak hours. Otherwise you may wait up to an hour, depending when.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lisa G.,"So, so good!  We stumbled upon this place while walking around downtown Toronto before a show.  Atmosphere is definitely trendy and youthful, but the service and food reflect a mature and well-run establishment.  My husband and I each ordered dishes that were new to us (though we've eaten Thai often before), and I couldn't tell you what they were called, but they were both perfectly delicious.  My dish that might have appeared to be a simple rice and shrimp meal was packed with layers of flavor; fresh, light and immensely satisfying.  Every plate that passed by our table looked and smelled amazing.  Server was attentive and knowledgeable.  Free Wi-Fi.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Laura G.,Great place amazing food ! People are nice even though we had to wait for over 45 minutes without a reservation to get seats,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dave M.,"This place lived up the the hype! The food is very authentic and extremely flavourful.  The location itself is cool too. It can be a bit loud, but not so much that you can't hear each other. 
Their unique selection of cocktails should intrigue you, and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,A D.,Awful customer service. Ordered through UberEATS. Wrong delivery by courier. Then didn't get full order. Bad customer service. Period. Management has to review their customer service standards.,1

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Miguel-Angel S.,"loved the food, the masaman curry is really excelent, if in Toronto again, I would defintely come back to this place",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rickie I.,"The place is very cute and has lovely ambience and cool music, along with an attentive and nice staff, but the food is just not good. I'm not sure why the rave reviews - maybe I ordered wrong - but while the Tom yum soup was flavorful, it was a pretty small serving for the price. The pad Ka prao with beef was recommended to me by the staff but was paradoxically both greasy and dry, the beef rather rubbery. Having traveled to Pai and extensively around Thailand, this place was a disappointment. Hope Toronto gets better Thai options if this is the best!",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gobin G.,"Good Thai Food, service is a bit lacking though!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kelly M.,not very good at all... kind of a crappy experience. will need to try another time and see if this was just an off visit.,1

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Steve K.,Ordered for takeout. The side order of sticky rice was tiny... smaller than the palm of my hand. The beef khao soi was good - almost identical to khao san roads. The pad thai was good. Also ordered the pork skewers and they had great flavour. The biggest downside was the tiny order of rice.,4

Certainly the tastiest Thai that I've had in Toronto, and I've probably tried about 20 others over the years. There is a bit more finesse to the recipes and higher quality ingredients than the average place. The Pad Gra Prow is divine.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,N. S.,This place has great food and not too pricey!! Been there many times. If you're going on a weekend make sure you make reservations it gets pretty busy! Once we waited for an hour and a half at the bar. The curries are good and the fried rice is very good also,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,R N.,Food is delicious!!  We've been there twice in the last week.  Can't wait to go back for more.  Make sure you leave room for dessert.  The seasonal mango sticky rice is amazing!,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Chelsea B.,"We had an amazing meal here. The staff was incredibly friendly, the vibe was mellow and the food was delicious. We were put on a huge wait list at Khao San Road and decided to wander over and try something new. We were really happy we made the 2 minute walk to Pai. We ate the squash fritters, beef salad, coconut curry, massaman curry, pineapple fried rice and finished with the mango sticky rice. All of the dishes were fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. An amazing place not to be missed.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sandra H.,"Excellent Thai dishes.  Poor, slow service resulted in getting our dishes served COLD.  We sent the dishes back only to have one dish come back hot and the other still cold!  After sending the cold dish back again did we get a freshly made dish.  There was no effort made in trying to compensate for this major oversight.
I'd like to come back, but not after this sad first impression.",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrew L.,"We dropped by for lunch and had the signature Chef Nuit's pad thai.  it was quite good - tangy, flavourful and very spicy.  It's probably the best in the downtown core -- but mainly because there isn't a lot of competition.  Elsewhere in chinatown and further north has just as good, though.  Service was a bit slow, but understandably given that the place was packed.
My main issue is that the place is VERY LOUD! Like a high school cafeteria, but noisier.  We could barely hear each other and our throats were a bit hoarse afterwards having to almost shout our conversation.  Definitely not a place for a business lunch to chat leisurely. Yelp lists the Noise Level here as 'Average', which is completely wrong.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Garet R.,"Fantastic food and relatively inexpensive, butternut fritters for starter were great and the pad thai was extremely tasty. Glad we went with this place. Cool atmosphere inside with some great older hip hop playing...",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Jannat N.,"Lately I've been into Thai food and PAI was just the best place I could find in Toronto for Thai food. During my first visit I ordered chef Nuit's pad Thai  with some lemongrass Iced tea. the grabong is a must try too. A couple of times after that the food hasn't been as awesome as it was the first time but I still really like this place. The chef and her husband are super nice and make you feel super comfortable and they have done up to please really well too, making it very welcoming for guests. Prepare in advance to wait in the line because it's always really busy. It's a reasonable restaurant and beats Khao San road anyday!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alex Y.,"It is a bit more expensive than your standard Thai variety but the quality is significantly better as well. I've tried the pork belly dishes as well as the beef massaman (not sure if spelled correctly) and both were fantastic. The thai sausage was also great and in general the meal varieties are not like anything you've experienced at other Thai cuisines, which is quite refreshing. The only reason this place doesn't deserve 4.5 or 5 stars is because of the drinks. The cocktails are far too overpriced for how good they are... which is not very.",4

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Mardi C.,"There are no words to describe how good this place is. 
If you like Thai food, you will absolutely love this place. Have had almost everything on the menu and have loved it all. 
Great atmosphere, great service and the best food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Adnan M.,"Great thai place in downtown. Similar to other Thai restaurants in the area, but they have more seating and I have never waited more than 20 minutes (vs. Khao San Road which can be an insane wait).
Ambiance is good, service is good. I pretty much always go for the house pad thai, it's great.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Cindy L.,"The food is 5 star! The price is 5 star! I got the pad thai and loved it! It is way better than Khao San Road in my opinion. The portion is large for the price you pay. The downside is the wait time, tooooo long even after they sat us down. Especially when you are hungry and you watch other people get their food and everything smells awesome. Excruciating. The place is cramped, ther's barely any space between tables. Not a good date place choice but if you are here for the food, definitely worth it. Next time I may try order take out.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ashley P.,The food is absolutely fabulous and the staff are very friendly. Highly recommend this place.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Maggie L.,"It was a bit of a wait on a weekday evening. I ordered the Khao Soi, and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was definitely enough of the soup/sauce leftover to make one or two more meals, so that was a nice bonus. I would definitely come back again to try the other items on their menu!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Foodie T.,"Pai is probably my absolute favourite restaurant in the city. Nuff said. Special shoutouts to the grabong, green curry, khao soi and pad gra prow beef. Honourary mention to the beef massaman.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,James P.,"Really nice, fresh Thai street food in a casual atmosphere.  Lots of fun!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Marty T.,A friend and I walked in asking if there are any TVs in this place. The bartender abruptly said there's a place with TV next door! Who the hell tells customers to visit some other place when you already have customers at the restaurant? Horrible customer service. We ordered the pork skewers and fried rice. Both were disgusting. Avoid this place! Go to khao san road instead.,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tony B.,"The holy grail of flavorful, spicy Thai food in Toronto. Since my first visit to Pai, I have made it a point to eat food from here at least once a month. A place of culinary delight with a variety of options and spice levels that will tease and tickle your taste buds. Pai is usually always packed because the food is so good. My personal favorites are the Massaman Beef Curry and the Pad Thai (Thai Spicy). The excellent service and upbeat atmosphere goes very well with the mouth watering food.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Al A.,"So good. 
Great flavour. Good Prices and the service i experienced was fantastic. 
Plan on waiting if you are going to eat in as there is usually a lineup.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Nish D.,"Really good Bloody Mary (goes by a different name) and short rib massaman was great. Cool little spot and good food. They lost a star for slight lack of authenticity and  spice heat levels which were laughable (medium has no heat whatsoever, definitely catering to a non-spicy palate)",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Simone C.,"i love pai. i pai almost every other week. never sick of the restaurant. the chicken pad thai is amazing. the chicken wings are amazing. the ""morning glory"" is amazing. the thai milk tea is amazing. basically, those are what i order every time i go. i looooooove pai.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Joe B.,Best Best Thai food in the city! Every dish is excellent. Just try to get a table early or between peak hours otherwise you'll have to wait.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emperuman V.,"This restaurant is one of the few Thai restaurants I've been to over the course of years. From my undergrad days in Ottawa, and currently in the GTA.
A friend of mine who's a big foodie had suggested this place, and we decided to go to this place. Mind you, my friend has been here before, and if he had not recommended it, I wouldn't have agreed. I also do trust his judgement, so that is something to make note of. I ended up driving from work which is in Aurora, and I could definitely say that it is worth the 1 hour and 45 minute drive on a Thursday evening in rush hour traffic on the 404/DVP. 
Parking is no problem, as there is ample parking nearby, and I definitely recommend the Impark parking as its multi level, safer and not shady. A $7 flat rate is what you pay in the evening on a weekday. 
We went to the restaurant, and at first, I enjoyed the fact that instead of traditional restaurants, you either walk up the stairs, or no stairs at all, however we had to walk down the stairs. From what I could tell the place was pretty packed, and this tells you something. The food and service has to be excellent, for it to be crowded and packed inside. The ambiance was a bit hip, and I did not mind it at all. We had to wait 15 minutes for our table, and eventually we sat down.
The waitress was very friendly, and ensured that we were well taken care off/looked after, however I did notice after paying that I was charged full price for an appetizer, where we instructed her that we will split the appetizers. One of the other appetizer was split 50/50 on the bill. Never mind, that is my fault for not spotting it on the get go. I don't mind too. 
My friend and I ordered the Gai Satay, Grabong for the appetizers, and for my main course, I ordered the vegan dish - Pad Pha Hett. It is not on their online menu, but from what I could recall, it contained steam rice, snow peas, bamboo shoots, peppercorn, ginger, red pepper, red curry and another vegetable or two. To place the order, we only had to wait 10 minutes. 
After waiting for 5 to 10 minutes, the Gai Satay came. At first, I was a bit surprised. Usually when food comes out that quick, it tells you one thing - it was rushed, and it won't taste great. Or so as Gordon Ramsay so eloquently puts it. However, I was wrong. It tasted great, and no I am not factoring in that I was hungry heh. The sauce that it came with was a perfect combination. For $11 there were 5 pieces of the Gai Satay. My friend was kind enough to let me have the last piece. After having the Gai Satay, few minutes after, the Grabong came. This is the squash fritter if I am not mistaken. At first, I thought it was the thin fries, and after having a taste, it was like sweet potato fries, yet tasted even better. I wasn't sure if I could taste the squash, but in the end, it still tasted pretty good. The portion size was just perfect for two people to share. Finally the Pad Pha Hett came. The portion size yet again was perfect. The spices, flavour, smell definitely got my senses and taste buds going. I could definitely taste the pepper corn and enjoyed the dish thoroughly, to the point that I wiped my plate clean XD I was tempted to lick the plate, but there was a couple sitting right beside us, and I did not want to show that I am animal or a pig when it comes to eating food. I made sure to restrict my male instincts, unlike my ancestors. 
Overall I would definitely recommend this place, and for the price paid its definitely worth it. So to you all there who live far, its definitely worth it, even though you are not in the Downtown area, definitely make a trip to this place. You won't regret it.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Emily C.,"I love the lunch menu. The set menu is a great deal! You can pick two items for a larger portion each or three items for a smaller portion each. It's great to try different dishes. Also, a warning, the street style noodles is SUPPOSED to be lukewarm. I was very confused when the dish came out as it was not hot but servers + other patrons have told me it's supposed to be that way.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Kaitlin K.,"Went with my boyfriend for a nice dinner out. This place honestly reminds me of a very positive pub, but in a good way! It was busy but not crowded, a variety of songs (from newer ones from top 40 charts and older ones such as Bohemian Rhapsody) playing and an electric atmosphere from everyone chatting. However, it was never too noisy and we didn't feel out of place. 
The staff were very accommodating. I'm on crutches so it was hard for me to get there as you go down a flight of stairs, however they found somewhere for us to sit that was convenient (near washrooms, by a wall for my crutches) and didn't make us feel like a burden. Our waitress was super kind and patient, without being overbearing.
I cannot handle any spice. Any spice is too spicy for me. My boyfriend is the opposite. The more spice the better. They offer the food with a spice scale, from no spice to Thai spice levels with extra spice. I ordered mild, and my boyfriend ordered the Thai with extra. The waitress ensured he would be okay with the spice and he said yes. I ordered the green curry in a coconut, and he got the pad thai with beef. 
The mild does have a bite to it, I honestly thought it was way too spicy for me but I can see how more seasoned diners can appreciate it compared to other levels. With that being said, it was delicious. It was creamy, coconutty, and slightly sweet. It is one of the best things I've ever eaten. There was a lot more chicken than vegetables, but I'm sure you can ask for more veggies. The pad thai was delicious. It was extremely spicy. I cried at the dinner table from one bite. My boyfriend thought, although very spicy, it could do with more. I'll also add the tofu is delicious. I prefer firm tofu and it was amazing there. I can't say much about his dish, as I couldn't eat it, but it was very tasty.
All in all, I'll definitely come back. I would absolutely recommend this to all my friends!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,jennifer w.,"I have always ordered the beef Pad gra prow and loved it for the freshness of the ingredients. It's always a big dish and you are never hungry afterwards. And the sliced cucumbers are so fresh and delicious. I also enjoy their spring rolls as once again, the ingredients are fresh and the skin is crispy.  The Chef is female and she use to be at Kao San Road, which I found has gone downhill. If you want to be sure to get a seat without a reservation, arrive by 5:30 pm and you will get one either at a table or at the bar.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Patrick T.,"Love the decor of pai. Brings me back to one of the Western hippie joints back in pai Thailand. The retro feel was done in good taste. The only issue I have is the benches are high. If you are short and sat on the bench it would be good. However if you're short and got stuck with a seat across the bench like I was, it brings you back to your childhood when your parents look down on you and tell you to eat your veggies. I ordered khao sao which is egg noodles and chicken over a yellow curry broth and crispy noodles on the side. Overall the dish was good but toward the end of the meal the broth felt rich. I guess I was just hungry to begin with hence didn't have that as a first impression. The chicken was OK. Although I didn't ask for the breast I got it. In hindsight it worked out since dark meat would have made it over the top. Over all the meal was a good experience. It does take you back to pai and they also serve Chang and singha beers.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Tammy E.,"Delicious every time, so I keep going back! One of the best pad thai dishes in Toronto :) Lunch time is super busy so go early or late, not right between noon and half past.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Matthew J.,"Amazing food, make sure u reserve a good time in advance.. Feels like your in a small restaurant in Thailand..",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Ruby J.,"Great service, the food was nice. I had the pad Thai with chicken. It was a bit too sweet for my taste, but I asked for extra peanuts and it helped.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andrea D.,"This is probably one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto. I went there twice and I will definitely going back. My favorite dish is Sai Ua, Thai northern Sausage that came with sticky rice and vegetable. I love it! Even though, the portion is a little bit smaller than I expected. My second favorite dishes is Tom Yom Krung came in an exotic hotpot. I ordered Thai level of spicy, it's pretty good but I still taste sweetness. Anyways, I recommend this place for everyone.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Rachel V.,"I went to Pai for my birthday dinner and JJ (the manager) was nothing but helpful organizing the night from the private room with a large table that could seat up to 20 to suggesting items we could all share and should try.
The food was delicious and as authentic Thai as we can get here. The best part is that it is also reasonably priced. Highly recommend.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Alicia F.,"Visited Pai last week for the first time and would go back again, despite the 40 minute wait. I was surprised at how busy it was on a very cold Tuesday night. It was so busy, that even after waiting 40 min, we had to sit at a communal table, which I'm not a fan of, but had no choice as we were hungry and tired of waiting. 
There was a great vibe happening, with loud 90's Hip Hop & Rap tunes playing. I liked the whole underground feel (as your literally underground). There was great energy, despite the fact the servers were constantly running around, making service very slow. 
I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, extra spicy! It was delicious, with a nice tamarind sauce and it had the right amount of kick my spicy taste buds desire. The serving was huge, so I was unable to eat the whole meal (take out containers were provided). My friend had the Khao Soi, which was phenomenal! It was a rich creamy golden beef curry (you can choose your meat). The flavours were spot on and very soothing for the cold night. 
I would recommend this restaurant if your into really good Thai food. Go before 7 pm, because after that it was super packed.
Enjoy!",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Umer A.,"One of the best Thai places in town for the actual food. The waiting is always a killer though and the seating is too tightly packed. Service can be meh. If they moved to a nicer, bigger location with a better ambiance and service, I'd give em 5 stars.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Edison S.,"Really wonderful spot. Delicious, flavourful, authentic Thai food. The decor is unique and fun and service was great, too. I've been numerous times and have always enjoyed everything.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Phil S.,Great Thai food! It is surprisingly difficult to find a decent Thai restaurant in Toronto. Pai and Khao San Road are my favourite. Pai's pad thai is pretty good!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Andy L.,"I definitely recommend this place if you like Thai Food. The atmosphere was great (if you like the clean pub/social feel) Great taste in music and the waiters were very nice. I started off with some soup, Tom yum kung, and it was delicious, exactly what I expected with the great burst of flavor (sour and spicy). For my meal, I got the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken. My craving was instantly satisfy as the flavor and hot-ness level was perfect. Overall, if you want thai food, they will give you thai food. Great spot for socializing or even a date. The only thing that I did not like was that you had to pay for tea. Definitely will be going back there and recommending it as it was a great experience.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Gina S.,"Best Thai food Ever. Make a reservation. If you don't, put your name in and take a walk - it's worth the wait.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Lily C.,"My go to place for pad Thai. Hands down the best pad Thai in the city. Beats khao San road, suko Thai, Thai princess, salad king etc any day! Will have to come back to try the other dishes.",5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Moreen C.,"Went there with two friends on weekdays after work. We waited a little bit (around 5 mins), not a long lineup. Seat was comfortable but the light was too dark for a restaurant, I barely see the items and pictures on the menu. I ordered chicken pai thai, portion is large but they should have cut the chicken smaller. Sauce is great but the dish is classic, so no surprise. Price is reasonable for the food you get, so generally a good experience.",4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Min W.,"The service is not so good, while I was waiting for the take out, a few waitress stopped by and keep asking if I have finished yet, actually I told each one of them I was waiting for my take out. At time of paying bills, the waitress keep asking if I need change back. No matter the service was good enough, I definitely would leave tips, plz give the change back first!!!",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Dwayne S.,Very authentic Thai experience and fun! (beer was good as well) Food can be hot! check with the staff.... they will point you in the right direction!,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Han K.,"Found the taste is too heavy. Service is just OK. Other than that, everything is good.",3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,E C.,Best Thai Place Ever !! The green curry is to die for :),5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,Sandra G.,Green Curry is out of this world. Ambience is fun and inviting. Always enjoy my experience here.,5
